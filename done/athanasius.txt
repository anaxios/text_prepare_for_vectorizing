   Editorial Preface.

   ------------------------

   It is with a sense of deep obligation to Mr. Robertson, the special
   editor, that this volume of the Post-Nicene series of the Fathers is
   presented to the subscribers and the public. It will furnish, as is
   believed, a more comprehensive and thorough introduction to the study
   of Athanasius than is elsewhere accessible, and the labour and devotion
   bestowed upon it are beyond all acknowledgment. Thanks must also be
   expressed to the publishers, by whose liberality the ordinary limits of
   the volumes of this series have been extended, in order that so
   important a Father as Athanasius might be represented with as much
   fulness as possible.

   Mr. Robertson's Preface explains the care and respect with which the
   translation and notes of Cardinal Newman have been treated, in
   reprinting them for the purpose of this edition. But there appeared in
   some parts of the translation inaccuracies which could not be
   reproduced consistently with a faithful representation of the original;
   and so far, therefore, and so far only, it has been corrected. Where
   any correction has been made in the Cardinal's notes, it is of course
   distinctly specified.

   I must add an expression of particular gratitude to my friend, the Rev.
   J. H. Lupton, Surmaster of St. Paul's School, for his generous help in
   reading the translations throughout, and for various valuable
   suggestions. The assistance of his scholarly learning gives me
   additional confidence in presenting this volume to the public.

   I must take the opportunity of expressing my great regret that there
   has been so considerable an interruption in the issue of the series.
   But by the sudden failure, partly from illness, and partly from other
   unforeseen causes, of two important contributions at the very moment
   when they were needed, the editor and the publishers were exposed to
   difficulties which were for the time insuperable. But other volumes of
   the series are now steadily progressing, and it is believed there will
   be no further interruptions in the publication.

   Preface.

   ------------------------

   In preparing the present volume the Editor has aimed at providing the
   English reader with the most complete apparatus for the study of
   Athanasius, his life, and his theological influence, which could be
   brought within the compass of a single volume of the Nicene and
   Post-Nicene Library.' The volume contains all the most important
   treatises of Athanasius (in as nearly as possible their exact
   chronological order), with the exception of the ad Serapionem, the
   contra Apollinarium, the ad Marcellinum, and the exegetical remains. On
   these and other treatises omitted from the present collection the
   reader is referred to the Prolegomena, ch. iii.

   A great part of the volume, including the bulk of the historical and
   anti-Arian works, and the Festal Letters, consists of a revision of
   translations and notes comprised in the Oxford Library of the Fathers.
   The notes to all, and the translation of most, of the works in
   question, excepting the Festal Letters, were prepared for that series
   by Mr. (since Cardinal) Newman. It was at first intended to incorporate
   his work without any change; but as the volume began to take shape this
   intention was inevitably to some extent modified; moreover, the limits
   of space demanded the sacrifice of some of the less important matter.
   The principles upon which the necessary changes have been made will be
   found stated on pp. 304, 305, 450. What is there said applies also to
   the de Decretis and Letter of Eusebius, as well as to the notes to the
   historical pieces; it may be added that the translation of the Fourth
   Discourse' has been very carefully revised, in order to secure the
   utmost closeness to the somewhat difficult original. In all the new
   translations, as well as in the revision of earlier work, the aim has
   been to secure the strictest fidelity compatible with clearness. The
   easy assumption that distinctions of tenses, constructions, &c., count
   for little or nothing in patristic Greek has been steadily resisted.
   Doubtless there are passages where the distinction, for example, of
   aorist and perfect, seems to fade away; but generally speaking,
   Athanasius is fully sensitive to this and other points of grammar.

   The incorporation in this volume of so much of the ample patristic
   learning of Cardinal Newman has inevitably involved some sacrifice of
   uniformity. To provide the new matter with illustrative notes on
   anything like the same scale, even had it been within the present
   editor's power, would have involved the crowding out of many works
   which the reader will certainly prefer to have before him. Again, many
   opinions are expressed by Cardinal Newman which the present editor is
   unable to accept. It may not be invidious to specify as an example the
   many cases in which the notes enforce views of Church authority,
   especially of papal authority, or again of the justifiableness of
   religious persecution, which appear to be at any rate foreign to the
   mind of Athanasius; or the tacit assumption that the men of the fourth
   century can be divided by a broad and fast line into orthodox and
   heretical, and that while everything may be believed to the discredit
   of the latter, the former were at once uniform in their convictions and
   consistently right in practice. Such an assumption operates with
   special injustice against men like Eusebius, whose position does not
   fall in with so summary a classification. But it has been thought
   better to leave the notes in nearly all such cases as they stand, only
   very rarely inserting a reference or observation to call attention to
   another aspect of the case. And in no instance has the editor forgotten
   the respect due to the theological learning and personal greatness of
   Cardinal Newman, or to his peculiar eminence as a religious thinker.

   But this has made it inevitable that many matters are regarded in one
   way in the notes of Newman, and in quite another where the present
   editor speaks for himself. What the great Cardinal says of his
   Historical Sketches' (Preface to vol. ii.) holds good to a large extent
   of his expositions of Athanasius. Though mainly historical, they are in
   their form and character polemical, as being directed against certain
   Protestant ideas and opinions.' The aim of the present editor has been
   throughout exclusively historical. He has regarded any polemical
   purpose as foreign to the spirit in which this series was undertaken,
   and moreover as fated in the long run to defeat its own aim. Whatever
   results may ultimately be reaped from the field of patristic studies,
   whether practical, dogmatic, or controversial, they must be resolutely
   postponed or rather ignored, pending the application of strict method
   to the criticism and interpretation of the texts, and to the
   reconstruction of the history whether of the life or of the doctrine of
   the Church. For the latter purpose, lucifera experimenta, non
   fructifera quÃ¦renda.' To follow this method, without concealing, but
   without obtruding, his personal convictions, has been the endeavour of
   the present editor. That he has succeeded, it is not for him to claim:
   but his work has been in this respect disinterested, and he ventures to
   hope that readers of all opinions will at least recognise in it un
   livre de bonne foy.'

   The Prolegomena are not intended to be anything approaching to a
   complete treatise upon the history, writings, or theology of S.
   Athanasius. They are simply what their title implies, an attempt to
   furnish in a connected form a preliminary account of the matters
   comprised in the text of the volume, such as on the one hand to reduce
   the necessity for a running historical commentary, on the other hand to
   prepare the reader for the study of the text itself.

   Full indices have been added for the same purpose. The general index
   comprises the leading theological and historical topics, and a complete
   register of all personal names. This latter seemed requisite in order
   to escape the arbitrariness of any line which might have been drawn
   between important and insignificant characters. The nobodies of history
   may occasionally be important witnesses. The index of Scripture texts
   has been made with painful attention to detail, and contains no
   unverified reference. To draw the line in each case between formal
   citation and mere reminiscence would have involved too great an
   expenditure of time and space; moreover there are many probable
   reminiscences of Scripture language which it would have been endless to
   include. But on the whole the index in question claims to be a complete
   synopsis of the use made of the Bible in the text of this volume. As
   such it is hoped that, with whatever occasional errors, it may be of
   use to the patristic and the biblical student alike.

   For the original matter comprised in this volume the editor disclaims
   any credit of his own. He has aimed simply at consulting and comparing
   the best authorities, at sifting their conclusions, and at following
   those which seem best founded. That in doing so the original sources
   are ready to hand throughout is the peculiar good fortune of those who
   work at Athanasius. It remains, then, for the editor to express his
   principal obligations to modern writers. To mention those of earlier
   date, such as Montfaucon and Tillemont, is merely to say that he has
   not neglected the indispensable foundations of his task. But Athanasius
   has also attracted to the study of his works much of the best patristic
   scholarship of recent times. Among the names mentioned in the first
   chapter of the Prolegomena, that of Cardinal Newman speaks for itself.
   No English student will neglect his Arians, however much some of its
   views may require modification. Pre-eminent for accurate knowledge of
   the texts and for vivid presentment of the history is Dr. Bright, whose
   works have been constantly open before the present editor, and have
   secured him from many an oversight. His occasional divergence from Dr.
   Bright's views, especially on points of chronology, has gone along with
   grateful appreciation of this scholar's genuine historical interest,
   large theological grasp, and perhaps unequalled personal sympathy with
   Athanasius as a man and as a writer. (On the use made in this volume of
   his Later Treatises of S. Athanasius, the reader is referred to what is
   said, infr. p. 482.)

   Last, but not least, the editor must acknowledge his obligations to Mr.
   Gwatkin. To say that that writer's Studies of Arianism have done more
   than any one work with which he is acquainted to place the intricate
   story of the period on a secure historical footing is saying a great
   deal, but by no means too much. To say that whatever historical
   accuracy has been attained in this volume has been rendered possible by
   Mr. Gwatkin's previous labours is to the present writer a matter of
   mere honest acknowledgment. Especially this is the case in
   chronological questions. Here Mr. Gwatkin has in no single instance
   been blindly followed, or without the attempt to interrogate the
   sources independently. But in nearly all cases Mr. Gwatkin's results,
   which, it should be added, are those accepted by the best continental
   students also, have held their own. It has been the editor's misfortune
   to differ from Mr. Gwatkin now and then, for example with regard to the
   Life of Antony: but even where he has differed as to conclusions, he
   has received help and instruction from Mr. Gwatkin's ample command of
   material, and genuinely scientific method.

   In addition to the above writers, the manifold obligations of the
   editor are recorded in the introductions and notes: if any have been
   passed over, it has been due to inadvertence or to the necessity of
   condensation. For the suggestions and help of personal friends the
   editor's gratitude may be here expressed without the mention of names.
   But he may specially mention the Rev. H. Ellershaw and Miss Payne
   Smith, to the former of whom he owes the translation of the Life of
   Antony, while the latter has kindly revised the Oxford translation of
   the bulk of the Festal Letters. Lastly, the many kindnesses, and
   uniform consideration, shewn to him by the English editor of this
   series call for his warmest recognition: that they may prove not wholly
   thrown away is the utmost that their recipient can venture to hope.

   ------------------------

   Chapter I.

   Literature

   Â§1. Editions, &c. (A) Before 1601 only Latin translations. The first,
   at Vicenza, 1482, completed by Barnabas Celsanus after the death of the
   translator Omnibonus of Lonigo; dedicated to Paul II. Contained a few
   works only, viz. the two books c. Gentes,' the letter to Serapion de
   Morte Arii, the De Incarn. adv. Arian. and adv. Apollin., the Dispute
   with Arius at the Council of NicÃ¦a.' (2) Paris, 1520, pub. by Jean
   Petit: two books c. Gent. fragment of the ad Marcellin. and some
   spuria.' (3) Second edition at Strassburg, 1522. (4) Basel, 1527, by
   Eramus: Serap. ill. and iv., de Decr., Apol. Fug., Apol. c. Ar. (part
   of), ad Monach.,' and some spuria' (he rejected Serap. i. as unworthy
   of Athan.!). (5) Lyons, 1532, same contents as numbers (2) and (4), but
   with renderings by Politian, Reuchlin, Erasmus, &c. (6) Cologne, 1632,
   similar contents. (7) 1556, Basel (apud Frobenium'), by P. Nannius, in
   4 volumes; great advance on previous editions. 3 vols. contain the
   version by Nannius of the genuina,' the fourth spuria,' rendered by
   others. The Nannian version was ably tested, and found wanting, under
   the direction of the congregation of the Index (Migne xxv. pp. xviii.
   sqq.). (8) 1564 (or 1584?) Basel (substantially the same). (9) 1570,
   Paris, Vita Antonii and five dialogues de Trin.,' version of Beza. (10)
   1572, Paris, five volumes, combining Nos. 7 and 9. (II) 1574, Paris,
   Letter ad Amun, Letter 39 (fragment), Letter ad Rufinianum. (12) 1581,
   Paris, incorporating the latter with No. 10. (13) Rome, 1623, the
   spurious de variis quÃ¦stionibus.

   (B) The first Greek Edition (14) 1601 at Heidelberg by Commelinus, with
   the Nannian Latin version (2 vols. fo. with a supplement of fragments,
   letters, &c., communicated by P. Felckmann). This edition was founded
   upon Felckmann's collation of numerous mss., of which the chief were
   (a) that in the Public Library at Basel (sÃ¦c. xiv., not ix.-x. as
   Felck. states; formerly belonged to the Dominican Friary there). (b)
   The Codex Christophorsoni,' now at Trin. Coll., Camb., sÃ¦c. xvi.
   ineunt. (g) A Codex Goblerianus' dated 1319, formerly tes mones tou
   kurizou, and principally used by Nannius. Neither this nor the
   remaining mss. of Felckmann are as yet, I believe, identified.
   (Particulars, Migne, P.G. xxv. p. xliii.) (15) 1608, Paris, pub. by C.
   Chappelet, edited by Fronton le Duc, S.J., Latin only. (17) 1612,
   Paris, No. 15, with Vit. Ant. in Greek and Latin, from an edition (16)
   of 1611, Augsburg, by HÃ¶schel, 4Âº. (18) 1627, Paris, Greek text of 1601
   with version of Nannius from edition No. 17, both injudiciously revised
   by Jean le Pescheur, from the critical notes of Felckmann himself,
   which however are omitted in this edition. (19) Cologne,' or rather
   Leipzig, 1686, poor reprint of No. 18 with the Syntagma DoctrinÃ¦ which
   Arnold had published in the previous year (see below, ch. ii. Â§9).
   (Montf. wrongly dates this 1681.)

   (C) All the above were entirely superseded by the great (20) 1698 Paris
   Benedictine Edition by Bernard de Montfaucon, aided, for part of vol.
   1, by Jacques Loppin, 3 volumes fol. (i.e. vol. 1, parts 1 and 2,
   genuina,' vol. 2 dubia et spuria'), with a new Latin Version and ample
   prolegomena, &c. Montfaucon took over, apparently without revision, the
   critical data of Felckmann (including his mistake as to the age of the
   Basel ms. but collated very many fresh mss. (principally Parisian, full
   particulars in Migne xxvi. pp. 1449, sqq.), and for the first time put
   the text on a fairly satisfactory footing. The Works of Athanasius were
   freshly arranged with an attempt at chronological order, and a Monitum'
   or short introduction prefixed to each. Critical, and a few
   explanatory, notes throughout; also an onomasticon' or glossary. This
   splendid edition was far more complete than its predecessors, and
   beautifully printed. After its completion, Montfaucon discovered fresh
   material, most of which he published in vol. 2 of his Collectio Nova
   Patrum,' Paris, 1706, with some further supplementary matter to his
   Prolegomena, partly in reply to Tillemont upon various critical
   questions; small additions in his Biblioth. Coisliniana, 1715. (The
   letters to Lucifer, included in Montfaucon's edition, had already seen
   the light in vol. iv. of the Bibliotheca Maxima Patrum (Lyons, 1677,
   Greek fathers in Latin only), and the two notes to Orsisius were taken
   from the life of Pachomius in the Acta SS. for May.)

   (21) 1746, Rome, the de Titulis Psalmorum, edited from Barberini and
   Vatican mss. by Cardinal Niccolo Antonelli. (22) 1769, Venice, vol. v.
   of the Bibliotheca Patrum' of the Oratorian Andrea Gallandi. Contains
   the works omitted in No. 20, chiefly from Montf. Coll. Nov., but with a
   few minor additions, and with the fragments and letters found by Maffei
   at Verona (see below, pp. 495, 554). (23) 1777, Padua, by Giustiniani,
   in four volumes, containing firstly Montfaucon's genuina' in two
   volumes, the dubia' and spuria' in the third, and the supplementary
   matter from (21) and (22) in the fourth. The printing of this standard
   edition is not equal to that of No. 20. (24) 1884' (1857), Paris, vols.
   xxv.-xxviii. of Migne's Patrologia GrÃ¦ca, a reprint of No. 23, but in a
   new order (see vol. xxviii. p. 1650), and with the addition of the
   Festal Letters from Mai (see below, p. 501). The merits and demerits of
   this series are well known. Of the latter, the most serious are the
   misprints, with which every page literally teems.

   (D) With Migne's edition the publication of a complete Athanasius (so
   far as his works are known to be extant) is attained, although there is
   still everything to be done towards the revision of the text on a
   critical basis. Among modern editions of large portions of Athanasius
   from the Benedictine text may be mentioned (25) Thilo, Athan. Opp.
   dogm. Selecta, Leipz. 1853. (26) Bright, Orations against the Arians
   (1873 2nd ed. 1883), and Historical Writings of Athanasius, 1881 (Oxf.
   Univ. Press), with introductions; both most convenient; his Lessons
   from the lives of three great Fathers (Longmans, 1890) gives an
   interesting popular study of Athan. Editions of separate books will be
   noticed in the short Introductions prefixed in this volume.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§2. Translations. The principal Latin versions have been referred to in
   Â§1. Of those in foreign languages it is not easy to procure adequate
   information. Fialon, in the work mentioned below, translates Apol.
   Const. and Apol. Fug.; in German the Bibliothek der KirchenvÃ¤ter,'
   vols. 13-18, Ausgew. Schriften des h. Ath., contains translations of
   several works by Fisch, Kempten from 1872. The principal English
   Translations are those in the Library of the Fathers.' Of these, those
   edited or translated by Newman are incorporated in this volume. Some
   letters included in this volume, as well as the work against
   Apollinarianism, are also comprised in the volume (Lib. Fath. 46, 1881)
   by Bright, with excellent notes, &c., and with a preface by Dr. Pusey
   (see below, p. 482). Translations of single books will be noticed in
   the respective Introductions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§3. Biographies. (a.) Ancient. The writings of Athanasius himself,
   while seldom furnishing precise chronological data, furnish almost all
   the primary information as to the facts of his eventful life. The
   earliest Life' is the panegyric of Gregory of Nazianzus (Or. 21),
   delivered at CP. 379 or 380, rich in praises, but less so in historical
   material. More important in the latter respect is the Historia Acephala
   (probably earlier than 390) printed in this volume, pp. 496, sqq. (The
   Edition by Sievers in Ztschr. fÃ¼r Hist. Theol. for 1868 is referred to
   in this volume as Sievers' simply.) It is a priceless source of
   chronological information, especially where it coincides with and
   confirms the data of the Festal Index (pp. 503, sqq.), a document
   probably earlier than 400. A secondary place is occupied by the Church
   historians, especially Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret, who draw
   largely from Athanasius himself, and from Rufinus, also in part from
   the Hist. Aceph. (especially Sozomen), and from Arian sources, which
   are mainly used by Philostorgius. More scattered notices in later
   ecclesiastical writers of the fourth century, especially Epiphanius;
   also Synesius, Jerome, Basil, &c., in the documents of the Councils,
   &c., and in the Life of Pachomius and other early documents relating to
   Egyptian Monasticism (see below, Introd. to Vit. Anton. and Appendix,
   pp. 188, 487).

   (b) Medieval. Under this head we may notice the Lives printed by
   Montfaucon among his Prolegomena. The first, Incerto Auctore,' is
   dependent on the fifth-century historians and of no value. A second,
   preserved by Photius (c. 840) is in the judgment of that scholar, which
   Montfaucon endorses unparalleled rubbish.' That by the Metaphrast 967)
   is a patchwork from earlier writers made with little skill, and not of
   use to the historian. An Arabic Life current in the Coptic Church,
   communicated to Montf. by Renandot, is given by Montf., as he says,
   that his readers may appreciate the stupendous ignorance and
   triviality' of that nation. Montf. mentions Latin Lives' compiled from
   Rufinus and from the Hist. Tripartita, of no value whatever.' Of the
   Life of Athanasius by Pachomius,' mentioned by Archd. Farrar (infra), I
   can obtain no particulars.

   (c) Modern. The first was that by Tortelius prefixed to the edition of
   1520 (Â§1 (2)), but compiled in the previous century and dedicated to
   Pope Eugenius IV. (good for its time,' M.). Montf. mentions a valueless
   life by Lipomanus and a worse one of unknown origin prefixed to other
   early editions. In 1671 Hermant made the first attempt at a critical
   biography (Paris); in 1664 an English work, "History of the Life and
   Actions of St. Athanasius by N.B. P.C. Catholick," with the imprimatur
   of Abp. Sheldon, had been published at London, in 1677 the biography in
   Cave, Lives of the Fathers, and in 1686-1704 du Pin, Nouvelle
   BibliothÃ¨que. About the same date appeared the first volume of the Acta
   SS. for May, which contains a careful life by Paperbroch (1685; ded. to
   Innocent XI.). But all previous (to say nothing of subsequent) labours
   were cast into the shade by the appearance of the Vita' of Montfaucon
   (Prolegg. to Tom. 1) in 1698, in which the chronology was reduced to
   order, and every particle of information lucidly digested; and by the
   Memoires' of M. Lenain de Tillemont' (vol. viii. in 1702), which go
   over the ground with quite equal thoroughness, and on many points
   traverse the conclusions of Montfaucon, whose work came into
   Tillemont's hands only when the latter was on his death-bed (1698). The
   ground was once more traversed with some fulness and with special
   attention to the literary and doctrinal work of Athan. by Remy
   Ceillier, (Aut. SacrÃ©s, vol. v. 1735). After this nothing remained to
   be done until the revival of interest in patristic studies during the
   present century. In 1827 appeared the monograph of MÃ¶hler Ath. der
   GrÃ¶sse' (Mainz), a dogmatic (R.C.) rather than a historical study: in
   1862 Stanley (Eastern Church,' Lect. vii.). BÃ¶hringer's life (in vol. 6
   of Kirchengesch. in Biographien, 1860-1879) is praised as thoroughly
   good and nearly exhaustive.' Fialon St. Athanase, Paris, 1877, is a
   most interesting and suggestive, though rather sketchy, treatment from
   an unusual point of view. P. Barbier Vie de St. A. (Tours, 1888) I have
   not seen. The best English life is that of Dr. Bright, first in the
   Introd. to the Orations' (supra, d. 26), but rewritten for the
   Dictionary of Christ. Biography. The same writer's Introd. to the Hist.
   Writings (supra ib.) is equally good and should also be consulted. A
   lucid and able sketch by Dr. Reynolds has been published by the
   Religious Tract Society, 1889, and Archd. Farrar, Lives of the Fathers,
   1, pp. 445-571, is eloquent and sympathetic.

   full bibliography in vol. 1 of this series, p. 445-465.

   (c) General History of the Church. It is unnecessary to enumerate the
   well-known general histories, all of which devote special pains to
   Athanasius and the Arian controversy. This is especially the case with
   Schaff, Nicene Christ. ii. 616-678, 884-893, with full bibliography.
   See also supra Â§3. Bright's Notes on the Canons (Oxf. 1882), and
   Hefele, vol. 2 (E. Tra.), are most useful: also Kaye, Council of NicÃ¦a
   (Works, vol. v. ed. 1888). Card. HergenrÃ¶ther's Kirchengeschichte
   (allowing for the natural bias of the writer) is fair and able, with
   good bibliographical references in the notes (ed. 1884). By far the
   best modern historical monograph on the Arian period is that of
   Gwatkin, Studies of Arianism, 1882, constantly referred to in this
   volume, and indispensable. His Arian Controversy, 1889, is an
   abridgement, but with supplementary discussions of importance on one or
   two points; very useful bibliography prefixed to both. (Cf. also below,
   Chap. v. Â§1) KÃ¶lling's Geschichte der Arianischen HÃ¤resie (1st vol.,
   1874, 2nd, 1883) is pretentious and uncritical.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§5. History of Doctrine. For ancient sources see articles Heresiology
   and Person of Christ in D.C.B., vols. iii., iv. The modern classics are
   the works of Petavius, de Trinitate (in vols. ii. and iii. of his De
   dogmat. Theol.) of Thomassinus, Dogmata Theologica, and of Bull,
   Defensio fidei NicÃ¦nÃ¦ (maintaining against Petav. the fixity of
   pre-Nicene doctrine). Under this head we include Newman's Arians of the
   Fourth Century, an English classic, unrivalled as a dogmatic and
   religious study of Arianism, although unsatisfactory on its purely
   historical side. (Obsolete chronology retained in all editions.) The
   general histories of Doctrine are of course full on the subject of
   Arianism; for an enumeration of them, see Harnack, Â§2 of his
   Prolegomena. In English we have Shedd (N.Y., 1863, Edinb., 1884),
   Hagenbach (Clark's Foreign Theol. Lib.), and the great work of Dorner
   (id.). The most important recent works are those of Harnack,
   Dogmengeschichte (1886, third vol., 1890), a most able work and
   (allowing for the prepossessions of the Ritschl school) impartial and
   philosophical; and Loofs, Leitfaden zur Dogmengeschichte (2 ed., 1890),
   on similar lines, but studiously temperate and fair. Both works are
   much used in this volume (quoted commonly as Harnack,' Loofs,' simply.
   Harnack, vol. i., is quoted from the first edition, but the later
   editions give comparative tables of the pages). For Councils and
   Creeds, in addition to the works of Hefele and Bright mentioned Â§4 c.,
   see Heurtley Harmonia Symbolica; Hahn, Bibliothek der Symbole; Hort,
   Two Dissertations (1876), indispensable for history of the Nicene
   Creed; Swainson, Nicene and Apostles' Creed, 1875; Caspari, Ungedruckte
   u.s.w. Quellen zum Taufsymbol u.s.w. (3 vols. in 2, Christiania,
   1866-1875), and Alte und Neue Quellen, ib. 1879; one of the most
   important of modern patristic works.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§6. Patristic Monographs. (a) Among the very numerous works of this
   kind, the most useful for our purpose are Zahn, Marcellus von Ancyra,
   1867, very important for doctrinal history; Reinkens, Hilarius von
   Poitiers, 1864; Fialon, St. Basile, 1868; Ullmann, Gregorius von
   Nazianz (2 ed., 1867, part of earlier ed. trans. by Cox, 1855); KrÃ¼ger,
   Lucifer von Calaris (excellent, especially for the Council of 362).
   Under this head may be mentioned the numerous excellent articles in
   Dict. Chr. Biog. referred to in their respective connexions.

   (b) On the doctrine of Athanasius. In addition to the works of Ceillier
   and MÃ¶hler referred to above, Atzberger, Die Logoslehre des h. Ath.
   (Munich, 1880); Voigt, Die Lehre des Athan. (Bremen, 1861); Pell, Lehre
   des h. Ath. von der SÃ¼nde und ErlÃ¶sung (Passau, 1888, a careful and
   meritorious analysis, candidly in the interest of Roman Catholicism.
   Difficulties not always faced).

   The above list of authorities, &c., does not pretend to completeness,
   nor to enumerate the sources for general secular or Church history. But
   in what relates specially to Athanasius it is hoped that an
   approximation to either requirement has been attained. Works bearing on
   more special points are referred to in their proper places. In
   particular, a special Brief Bibliography is prefixed to the Vita
   Antonii.

   Id primum scitu opus est in proposito nobis minime fuisse ut omnia ad
   Arium Arianos aliosque haereticos illius aetatis itidemque Alexandrum
   Alexandrinum Hosium Marcellum Serapionem aliosque Athanasii familiares
   aut synodos spectantia recensere sed solummodo ea quÃ¦ uel ad Athanasii
   Vitam pertinent uel ad eam proxime accedunt.--Montfaucon.

   Athanasius was born between 296 and 298 [1] . His parents, according to
   later writers, were of high rank and wealthy. At any rate, their son
   received a liberal education. In his most youthful work we find him
   repeatedly quoting Plato, and ready with a definition from the Organon
   of Aristotle. He is also familiar with the theories of various
   philosophical schools, and in particular with the developments of
   Neo-Platonism. In later works, he quotes Homer more than once (Hist.
   Ar. 68, Orat. iv. 29), he addresses to Constantius a defence bearing
   unmistakeable traces of a study of Demosthenes de Corona (Fialon, pp.
   286 sq. 293). His education was that of a Greek: Egyptian antiquities
   and religion, the monuments and their history, have no special interest
   for him: he nowhere betrays any trace of Egyptian national feeling. But
   from early years another element had taken a first place in his
   training and in his interest. It was in the Holy Scriptures that his
   martyr teachers had instructed him, and in the Scriptures his mind and
   writings are saturated. Ignorant of Hebrew, and only rarely appealing
   to other Greek versions (to Aquila once in the Ecthesis, to other
   versions once or twice upon the Psalms), his knowledge of the Old
   Testament is limited to the Septuagint. But of it, as well as of the
   New Testament, he has an astonishing command, 'Alexandreus to genei,
   aner logios, dunatos on en tais graphais. The combination of Scriptural
   study and of Greek learning was what one expects in a pupil of the
   famous Alexandrian School; and it was in this School, the School of
   Clement and Origen, of Dionysius and Theognostus, that young Athanasius
   learned, possibly at first from the lips of Peter the bishop and martyr
   of 311 [2] . The influence of Origen still coloured the traditions of
   the theological school of Alexandria. It was from Alexander, Bishop of
   Alexandria 312-328, himself an Origenist of the right wing,' that
   Athanasius received his moulding at the critical period of his later
   teens.

   Of his first introduction to Alexander a famous story is told by
   Rufinus (Hist. Eccl. I. xiv.). The Bishop, on the anniversary of the
   martyrdom of his predecessor, Peter, was expecting some clergy to
   dinner after service in a house by the sea. Out of the window, he saw
   some boys at play on the shore: as he watched, he saw that they were
   imitating the sacred rites of the Church. Thinking at last that they
   were going too far, he sent some of his clergy to bring them in. At
   first his enquiries of the little fellows produced an alarmed denial.
   But at length he elicited that one of them had acted the Bishop and had
   baptized some of the others in the character of catechumens. On
   ascertaining that all details had been duly observed, he consulted his
   clergy, and decided that the baptisms should be treated as valid, and
   that the boy-bishop and his clergy had given such plain proof of their
   vocation that their parents must be instructed to hand them over to be
   educated for the sacred profession. Young Athanasius accordingly, after
   a further course of elementary studies, was handed over to the bishop
   to be brought up, like Samuel, in the Temple of God. This, adds Sozomen
   (ii. 17), was the origin of his subsequent attachment to Alexander as
   deacon and secretary. The story is credited by some writers of weight
   (most recently, by Archdeacon Farrar), but seems highly improbable. It
   depends on the single authority of a writer not famed for historical
   judgment, and on the very first anniversary of Peter's martyrdom, when
   Alexander had hardly ascended the episcopal throne, Athanasius was at
   least fourteen years old. The probability that the anniversary would
   have been other than the first, and the possibility that Athanasius was
   even older, coupled with the certainty that his theological study began
   before Peter's martyrdom, compel us to mark the story with at least a
   strong note of interrogation. But it may be allowed to confirm us in
   the belief that Alexander early singled out the promise of ability and
   devotion which marked Athanasius for his right-hand man long before the
   crisis which first proved his unique value.

   His years of study and work in the bishop's household bore rich fruit
   in the two youthful works already alluded to. These works more than any
   later writings of Athanasius bear traces of the Alexandrian theology
   and of the influence of Origenism: but in them already we trace the
   independent grasp of Christian principles which mark Athanasius as the
   representative of something more than a school, however noble and
   many-sided. It was not as a theologian, but as a believing soul in need
   of a Saviour, that Athanasius approached the mystery of Christ.
   Throughout the mazes of the Arian controversy his tenacious hold upon
   this fundamental principle steered his course and balanced his
   theology. And it is this that above all else characterises the golden
   treatise on the Incarnation of the Word. There is, however, one element
   in the influence of Origen and his successors which already comes out,
   and which never lost its hold upon Athanasius,--the principle of
   asceticism. Although the ascetic tendency was present in Christianity
   from the first, and had already burst forth into extravagance in such
   men as Tertullian, it was reserved for the school of Origen, influenced
   by Platonist ideas of the world and life, to give to it the rank of an
   acknowledged principle of Christian morals--to give the stimulus to
   monasticism (see below, p. 193). Among the acclamations which
   accompanied the election of Athanasius to the episcopate that of heis
   ton askeon was conspicuous (Apol. Ar. 6). In de Incarn. 51. 1, 48. 2,
   we seem to recognise the future biographer of Antony [3] .
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1] He was unable to speak from memory of the events of the persecution
   of 303 (Hist. Ar. 64), but (de Incarn. 56. 2) had been instructed in
   religion by persons who had suffered as martyrs. This must have been
   before 311, the date of the last persecution in Egypt under Maximin.
   Before 319 he had written his first books against the Gentiles,' the
   latter of which, on the Incarnation, implies a full maturity of power
   in the writer, while the former is full of philosophical and
   mythological knowledge such as argues advanced education. But from
   several sources we learn that his election to the episcopate in 328 was
   impugned, at any rate in after years, on the ground of his not having
   attained the canonical age of thirty. There is no ground for supposing
   that this was true: but such a charge would not be made without some
   ground at least of plausibility. We must therefore suppose that on June
   8, 328, he was not much beyond his thirtieth year. His parents,
   moreover, were living after the year 358 (see below, p. 562, note 6);
   allowing them over fourscore years at that date, we find in 298 a
   reasonable date for the birth of their son. We must remember that in
   southern climates mind and body mature somewhat more rapidly than with
   ourselves, and contra Gentes' and de Incarnatione' will scarcely appear
   precocious.

   [2] The statements of Greg. Naz. that he frequented classes of grammar
   and rhetoric is probable enough; that of Sulpitius Severus that he was
   juris consultus' lacks corroboration.

   [3] The actual connection of Athanasius with Antony at this period is
   implied in the received text of Vit. Anton.' Prolog., for it could
   scarcely fall at any later date. At the same time the youthful life of
   Athanasius seems fully accounted for in such a way as to leave little
   room for it (so Tillemont). But our ignorance of details leaves it just
   possible that he may for a time have visited the great hermit and
   ministered to him as Elisha did of old to Elijah. (Cf. p. 195, note 2.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§2. The Arian Controversy before NicÃ¦a, 319-325.

   At the time when Athanasius first appeared as an author, the condition
   of Christian Egypt was not peaceful. Meletius, bishop of Lycopolis, was
   accused of having sacrificed during the persecution in 301 (pp. 131,
   234); condemned by a synod under bishop Peter, he had carried on
   schismatical intrigues under Peter, Achillas, and Alexander, and by
   this time had a large following, especially in Upper Egypt. Many cities
   had Meletian bishops: many of the hermits, and even communities of
   monks (p. 135), were on his side.

   The Meletian account of the matter (preserved by Epiphan. HÃ¦r. 58) was
   different from this. Meletius had been in prison along with Peter, and
   had differed from him on the question of the lapsed, taking the sterner
   view, in which most of the imprisoned clergy supported him. It would
   not be without a parallel (D.C.B. art. Donatists, Novatian) in the
   history of the burning question of the lapsi to suppose that Meletius
   recoiled from a compromised position to the advocacy of impossible
   strictness. At any rate (de Incarn. 24. 4) the Egyptian Church was rent
   by a formidable schism. No doctrinal question, however, was involved.
   The alliance of Meletians and Arians belongs to a later date.

   It is doubtful whether the outbreak of the Arian controversy at
   Alexandria was directly connected with the previous Christological
   controversies in the same Church. The great Dionysius some half-century
   before had been involved in controversy with members of his Church both
   in Alexandria and in the suffragan dioceses of Libya (infr. p. 173). Of
   the sequel of that controversy we have no direct knowledge: but we find
   several bishops and numerous clergy and laity in Alexandria and Libya
   [4] ready to side with Arius against his bishop.

   The origin of the controversy is obscure. It certainly must be placed
   as early as 318 or 319, to leave sufficient time before the final
   deposition of Arius in the council of 321 (infr. p. 234). We are told
   that Arius, a native of Libya, had settled in Alexandria soon after the
   origin of the Meletian schism, and had from motives of ambition sided
   at first with Meletius, then with Peter, who ordained him deacon, but
   afterwards was compelled to depose him (Epiph. HÃ¦r. 69, Sozom. i. 15).
   He became reconciled to Achillas, who raised him to the presbyterate.
   Disappointed of the bishopric at the election of Alexander, he nurtured
   a private grudge (Thdt. H. E. i. 2), which eventually culminated in
   opposition to his teaching. These tales deserve little credit: they are
   unsupported by Athanasius, and bear every trace of invention ex post
   facto. That Arius was a vain person we see from his Thalia (infr. p.
   308): but he certainly possessed claims to personal respect, and we
   find him not only in charge of the urban parish of Baucalis, but
   entrusted with the duties of a professor of scriptural exegesis. There
   is in fact no necessity to seek for personal motives to explain the
   dispute. The Arian problem was one which the Church was unable to
   avoid. Not until every alternative had been tried and rejected was the
   final theological expression of her faith possible. Two great streams
   of theological influence had run their course in the third century: the
   subordinationist theology of Origen at Alexandria, the Monarchian
   theology of the West and of Asia which had found a logical expression
   in Paul of Samosata. Both streams had met in Lucian the martyr, at
   Antioch, and in Arius, the pupil of Lucian, produced a result which
   combined elements of both (see below, Â§3 (2) a). According to some
   authorities Arius was the aggressor. He challenged some theological
   statements of Alexander as Sabellian, urging in opposition to them that
   if the Son were truly a Son He must have had a beginning, and that
   there had been therefore a time when He did not exist. According to
   others (Constantine in Eus. Vit. ii. 69) Alexander had demanded of his
   presbyters an explanation of some passage of Scripture which had led
   Arius to broach his heresy. At any rate the attitude of Alexander was
   at first conciliatory. Himself an Origenist, he was willing to give
   Arius a fair hearing (Sozom. ubi supra). But the latter was
   impracticable. He began to canvass for support, and his doctrine was
   widely accepted. Among his first partisans were a number of lay people
   and virgins, five presbyters of Alexandria, six deacons, including
   Euzoius, afterwards Arian bishop at Antioch (a.d. 361), and the Libyan
   bishops Secundus of Ptolemais in Pentapolis (see p. 226) and Theonas of
   Marmarica (see p. 70). A letter was addressed to Arius and his friends
   by Alexander, and signed by the clergy of Alexandria, but without
   result. A synod was now called (infr. p. 70, Socr. i. 6) of the bishops
   of Egypt and Libya, and Arius and his allies deposed. Even this did not
   check the movement. In Egypt two presbyters and four deacons of the
   Mareotis, one of the former being Pistus, a later Arian bishop of
   Alexandria, declared for Arius; while abroad he was in correspondence
   with influential bishops who cordially promised their support.
   Conspicuous among the latter was a man of whom we shall hear much in
   the earlier treatises of this volume, Eusebius, bishop of Berytus, who
   had recently, against the older custom of the Church (p. 103, note 6),
   but in accordance with what has ever since been general in the case of
   important sees, been translated to the imperial city of Nicomedia. High
   in the favour, perhaps related to the family, of Constantine, possessed
   of theological training and practical ability, this remarkable man was
   for nearly a quarter of a century the head and centre of the Arian
   cause. (For his character and history, see the excellent article in
   D.C.B. ii. 360-367.) He had been a fellow-pupil of Arius in the school
   of Lucian, and fully shared his opinions (his letter to Paulinus of
   Tyre, Thdt. H. E. i. 6). The letter addressed to him by Arius (ib. 5)
   is one of our most important Arian monuments. Arius claims the sympathy
   of Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea and other leading bishops, in fact of all the
   East excepting Macarius of Jerusalem and two others, heretical and
   untutored persons.' Eusebius responded with zeal to the appeal of his
   fellow-Lucianist.' While Alexander was indefatigable in writing to warn
   the bishops everywhere against Arius (who had now left Alexandria to
   seek foreign support, first in Palestine, then at Nicomedia), and in
   particular addressed a long letter to Alexander, bishop of Byzantium
   (Thdt. H. E. i. 4), Eusebius called a council at Nicomedia, which
   issued letters in favour of Arius to many bishops, and urged Alexander
   himself to receive him to communion. Meanwhile a fresh complication had
   appeared in Egypt. Colluthus, whose name stands first among the
   signatures to the memorandum (to be mentioned presently) of the
   deposition of Arius, impatient it would seem at the moderation of
   Alexander, founded a schism of his own, and although merely a
   presbyter, took upon himself to ordain. In Egypt and abroad confusion
   reigned: parties formed in every city, bishops, to adopt the simile of
   Eusebius (Vit. Const.), collided like the fabled Symplegades, the most
   sacred of subjects were bandied about in the mouths of the populace,
   Christian and heathen.

   In all this confusion Athanasius was ready with his convictions. His
   sure instinct and powerful grasp of the centre of the question made him
   the mainstay of his Bishop in the painful conflict. At a stage [5] of
   it difficult to determine with precision, Alexander sent out to the
   bishops of the Church at large a concise and carefully-worded
   memorandum of the decision of the Egyptian Synod of 321, fortified by
   the signatures of the clergy of Alexandria and the Mareotis (see infra,
   pp. 68-71).

   This weighty document, so different in thought and style from the
   letter of Alexander preserved by Theodoret, bears the clear stamp of
   the mind and character of Athanasius: it contains the germ of which his
   whole series of anti-Arian writings are the expansion (see introd. and
   notes, pp. 68-71), and is a significant comment on the hint of the
   Egyptian. bishops (Apol. c. Ar. 6 ad init.).

   Early in 324 a new actor came upon the scene. Hosius, bishop of Cordova
   and confessor (he is referred to, not by name, Vit. Const. ii. 63, 73,
   cf. iii. 7, ho panu boomenos; by name, Socr. i. 7), arrived with a
   letter from the Emperor himself, intreating both parties to make peace,
   and treating the matter as one of trivial moment. The letter may have
   been written upon information furnished by Eusebius (D.C.B. s.v.); but
   the anxiety of the Emperor for the peace of his new dominions is its
   keynote. On the arrival of Hosius a council (p. 140) was held, which
   produced little effect as far as the main question was concerned: but
   the claims of Colluthus were absolutely disallowed, and his ordination
   of one Ischyras (infr. Â§5) to the presbyterate pronounced null and
   void. Hosius apparently carried back with him a strong report in favour
   of Alexander; at any rate the Emperor is credited (Gelas. Cyz. ii.,
   Hard. Conc. i. 451-458) with a vehement letter of rebuke to Arius,
   possibly at this juncture. Such was the state of affairs which led to
   the imperial resolve, probably at the suggestion of Hosius, to summon a
   council of bishops from the whole world to decide the doctrinal
   question, as well as the relatively lesser matters in controversy.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [4] It is of interest to note the changed conditions. In 260 bishop
   Dionysius had to check the Monarchian tendency in Libya, and was
   accused by members of his own flock of separating the Son from the
   Being (ousia) of the Father. In 319 a Libyan, Arius, cries out upon the
   Sabellianism of his bishop, and formulates the very doctrine which
   Dionysius had been accused of maintaining.

   [5] The chronology cannot be determined with precision. The Memorandum
   is signed by Colluthus and therefore precedes his schism. The letter to
   Alex. Byzant. was written after the Colluthian schism had begun. But
   the proceedings of Eusebius described above had at least begun when the
   Memorandum was circulated, which must, therefore, have been some time
   after the Synod of 321. The letter of Alexander to his clergy prefixed
   to the depositio was drawn up after it, and includes the names of the
   Mareotic seceders. We may, therefore, tentatively adopt the following
   series:--321 a.d.: Egyptian Synod deposes Arius. Arius in
   correspondence with Eusebius, &c. Leaves Alexandria for Palestine and
   Nicomedia. Letters sent abroad by Alexander. Eusebius holds council and
   writes to Alexander. 322: Memorandum drawn up; Alexandrian clergy
   assemble to sign it; prefatory address to them by Alexander with
   reference to the Mareotic defection which has just occurred;
   circulation of Memorandum; schism of Colluthus. 323: Letter of
   Alexander to Alexander of Byzantium; (Sept.) Constantine, master of the
   East, and ready to intervene in the controversy.

   Â§3 (1) The Council of NicÃ¦a.

   An ecumenical council was a new experiment. Local councils had long
   since grown to be a recognised organ of the Church both for legislation
   and for judicial proceedings. But no precedent as yet prescribed, no
   ecclesiastical law or theological principle had as yet enthroned, the
   General Council' as the supreme expression of the Church's mind.
   Constantine had already referred the case of the Donatists first to a
   select council at Rome under bishop Miltiades, then to what Augustine
   (Ep. 43) has been understood to call a plenarium ecclesiÃ¦ universÃ¦
   concilium' at Arles in 314. This remedy for schism was now to be tried
   on a grander scale. That the heads of all the Churches of Christendom
   should meet in free and brotherly deliberation, and should testify to
   all the world their agreement in the Faith handed down independently
   but harmoniously from the earliest times in Churches widely remote in
   situation, and separated by differences of language, race, and
   civilisation, is a grand and impressive idea, an idea approximately
   realised at NicÃ¦a as in no other assembly that has ever met. The
   testimony of such an assembly carries the strongest evidential weight;
   and the almost unanimous horror of the Nicene Bishops at the novelty
   and profaneness of Arianism condemns it irrevocably as alien to the
   immemorial belief of the Churches. But it was one thing to perceive
   this, another to formulate the positive belief of the Church in such a
   way as to exclude the heresy; one thing to agree in condemning Arian
   formulÃ¦, another to agree upon an adequate test of orthodoxy. This was
   the problem which lay before the council, and with which only its more
   clearsighted members tenaciously grappled: this is the explanation of
   the reaction which followed, and which for more than a generation, for
   well nigh half a century after, placed its results in jeopardy. The
   number of bishops who met at NicÃ¦a was over 250 [6] . They represented
   many nationalities (Euseb. ubi supra.), but only a handful came from
   the West, the chief being Hosius, CÃ¦cilian of Carthage, and the
   presbyters sent by Silvester of Rome, whose age prevented his presence
   in person. The council lasted from the end of May till Aug. 25 (see
   D.C.A., 1389). With the many picturesque stories told of its incidents
   we have nothing to do (Stanley's Eastern Church, Socr. i. 10-12, Soz.
   i. 17, 18, Rufin. H. E. i. 3-5); but it may be well to note the
   division of parties. (1) Of thoroughgoing partisans of Arius, Secundus
   [7] and Theonas alone scorned all compromise. But Eusebius of
   Nicomedia, Theognis, Bishop of NicÃ¦a itself, and Maris of Chalcedon,
   also belonged to the inner circle of Arians by conviction (Socr. i. 8;
   Soz. i. 21 makes up the same number, but wrongly). The three last-named
   were pupils of Lucian (Philost. ii. 15). Some twelve others (the chief
   names are Athanasius of Anazarbus and Narcissus of Neronias, in
   Cilicia; Patrophilus of Scythopolis, Aetius of Lydda, Paulinus of Tyre,
   Theodotus of Laodicea, Gregory of Berytus, in Syria and Palestine;
   Menophantus of Ephesus; for a fuller discussion see Gwatk. p. 31, n. 3)
   completed the strength of the Arian party proper. (2) On the other hand
   a clearly formulated doctrinal position in contrast to Arianism was
   taken up by a minority only, although this minority carried the day.
   Alexander of Alexandria of course was the rallying point of this wing,
   but the choice of the formula proceeded from other minds. gpostasis and
   housia are one in the Nicene formula: Alexander in 323 writes of treis
   upostaseis.

   The test formula of NicÃ¦a was the work of two concurrent influences,
   that of the anti-Origenists of the East, especially Marcellus of
   Ancyra, Eustathius of Antioch, supported by Macarius of Ã†lia,'
   Hellanicus of Tripolis, and Asclepas of Gaza, and that of the Western
   bishops, especially Hosius of Cordova. The latter fact explains the
   energetic intervention of Constantine at the critical moment on behalf
   of the test (see below, and Ep. Eus. p. 75); the word was commended to
   the Fathers by Constantine, but Constantine was prompted' by Hosius
   (Harnack, Dogmg. ii. 226); houtos ten en Nikai& 139; piotin exetheto
   (infr. p. 285, Â§42). Alexander (the Origenist) had been prepared for
   this by Hosius beforehand (Soc. iii. 7; Philost. i. 7; cf. Zahn
   Marcell. p. 23, and Harnack's important note, p. 229). Least of all was
   Athanasius the author of the homoousion; his whole attitude toward the
   famous test (infr. p. 303) is that of loyal acceptance and assimilation
   rather than of native inward affinity. He was moulded by the Nicene
   Creed, did not mould it himself' (Loofs, p. 134). The theological
   keynote of the council was struck by a small minority; Eustathius,
   Marcellus, perhaps Macarius, and the Westerns, above all Hosius; the
   numbers were doubtless contributed by the Egyptian bishops who had
   condemned Arius in 321. The signatures, which seem partly incorrect,
   preserve a list of about 20. The party then which rallied round
   Alexander in formal opposition to the Arians may be put down at over
   thirty. The men who best understood Arianism were most decided on the
   necessity of its formal condemnation.' (Gwatkin.) To this compact and
   determined group the result of the council was due, and in their
   struggle they owed much--how much it is hard to determine--to the
   energy and eloquence of the deacon Athanasius, who had accompanied his
   bishop to the council as an indispensable companion (infr. p. 103; Soz.
   i. 17 fin.). (3) Between the convinced Arians and their reasoned
   opponents lay the great mass of the bishops, 200 and more, nearly all
   from Syria and Asia Minor, who wished for nothing more than that they
   might hand on to those who came after them the faith they had received
   at baptism, and had learned from their predecessors. These were the
   conservatives [8] ,' or middle party, composed of all those who, for
   whatever reason, while untainted with Arianism, yet either failed to
   feel its urgent danger to the Church, or else to hold steadily in view
   the necessity of an adequate test if it was to be banished. Simple
   shepherds like Spyridion of Cyprus; men of the world who were more
   interested in their libelli than in the magnitude of the doctrinal
   issue; theologians, a numerous class, who on the basis of
   half-understood Origenist ideas were prepared to recognise in Christ
   only the Mediator appointed (no doubt before all ages) between God and
   the World' (Zahn Marc. p. 30); men who in the best of faith yet failed
   from lack of intellectual clearsightedness to grasp the question for
   themselves; a few, possibly, who were inclined to think that Arius was
   hardly used and might be right after all; such were the main elements
   which made up the mass of the council, and upon whose indefiniteness,
   sympathy, or unwillingness to impose any effective test, the Arian
   party based their hopes at any rate of toleration. Spokesman and leader
   of the middle party was the most learned Churchman of the age, Eusebius
   of CÃ¦sarea. A devoted admirer of Origen, but independent of the school
   of Lucian, he had, during the early stages of the controversy, thrown
   his weight on the side of toleration for Arius. He had himself used
   compromising language, and in his letter to the CÃ¦sarean Church (infra,
   p. 76 sq.) does so again. But equally strong language can be cited from
   him on the other side, and belonging as he does properly to the
   pre-Nicene age, it is highly invidious to make the most of his
   Arianising passages, and, ignoring or explaining away those on the
   other side, and depreciating his splendid and lasting services to
   Christian learning, to class him summarily with his namesake of
   Nicomedia [9] . (See Prolegg. to vol. 1 of this series, and above all
   the article in D.C.B.) The fact however remains, that Eusebius gave
   something more than moral support to the Arians. He was neither a great
   man nor a clear thinker' (Gwatkin); his own theology was hazy and
   involved; as an Origenist, his main dread was of Monarchianism, and his
   policy in the council was to stave off at least such a condemnation of
   Arianism as should open the door to confounding the Persons.' Eusebius
   apparently represents, therefore, the left wing,' or the last
   mentioned, of the conservative' elements in the council (supra, and
   Gwatkin, p. 38); but his learning, age, position, and the ascendency of
   Origenist Theology in the East, marked him out as the leader of the
   whole.

   But the conservatism' of the great mass of bishops rejected Arianism
   more promptly than had been expected by its adherents or patrons.

   The real work of the council did not begin at once. The way was blocked
   by innumerable applications to the Christian Emperor from bishops and
   clergy, mainly for the redress of personal grievances. Commonplace men
   often fail to see the proportion of things, and to rise to the
   magnitude of the events in which they play their part. At last
   Constantine appointed a day for the formal and final reception of all
   personal complaints, and burnt the libelli' in the presence of the
   assembled fathers. He then named a day by which the bishops were to be
   ready for a formal decision of the matters in dispute. The way was now
   open for the leaders to set to work. Quasi-formal meetings were held,
   Arius and his supporters met the bishops, and the situation began to
   clear (Soz. i. 17). To their dismay (de Decr. 3) the Arian leaders
   realised that they could only count on some seventeen supporters out of
   the entire body of bishops. They would seem to have seriously and
   honestly underrated the novelty of their own teaching (cf. the letter
   of Arius in Thdt. i. 5), and to have come to the council with the
   expectation of victory over the party of Alexander. But they discovered
   their mistake:--

   Sectamur ultro, quos opimus

   Fallere et effugere est triumphus."

   Fallere et effugere' was in fact the problem which now confronted them.
   It seems to have been agreed at an early stage, perhaps it was
   understood from the first, that some formula of the unanimous belief of
   the Church must be fixed upon to make an end of controversy. The
   Alexandrians and Conservatives' confronted the Arians with the
   traditional Scriptural phrases (pp. 163, 491) which appeared to leave
   no doubt as to the eternal Godhead of the Son. But to their surprise
   they were met with perfect acquiescence. Only as each test was
   propounded, it was observed that the suspected party whispered and
   gesticulated to one another, evidently hinting that each could be
   safely accepted, since it admitted of evasion. If their assent was
   asked to the formula like to the Father in all things,' it was given
   with the reservation that man as such is the image and glory of God.'
   The power of God' elicited the whispered explanation that the host of
   Israel was spoken of as dunamis kuriou, and that even the locust and
   caterpillar are called the power of God.' The eternity' of the Son was
   countered by the text, We that live are alway (2 Cor. iv. 11)!' The
   fathers were baffled, and the test of homoousion, with which the
   minority had been ready from the first, was being forced (p. 172) upon
   the majority by the evasions of the Arians. When the day for the
   decisive meeting arrived it was felt that the choice lay between the
   adoption of the word, cost what it might, and the admission of Arianism
   to a position of toleration and influence in the Church. But then, was
   Arianism all that Alexander and Eustathius made it out to be? was
   Arianism so very intolerable, that this novel test must be imposed on
   the Church? The answer came (Newman Ar. 4 p. 252) from Eusebius of
   Nicomedia. Upon the assembling of the bishops for their momentous
   debate (hos de ezeteito tes pisteos ho tropos, Eustath.) he presented
   them with a statement of his belief. The previous course of events may
   have convinced him that half-measures would defeat their own purpose,
   and that a challenge to the enemy, a forlorn hope, was the only resort
   left to him [10] . At any rate the statement was an unambiguous
   assertion of the Arian formulÃ¦, and it cleared the situation at once.
   An angry clamour silenced the innovator, and his document was publicly
   torn to shreds (hup' opsei panton, says an eye-witness in Thdt. i. 8).
   Even the majority of the Arians were cowed, and the party were reduced
   to the inner circle of five (supra). It was now agreed on all hands
   that a stringent formula was needed. But Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea came
   forward with a last effort to stave off the inevitable. He produced a
   formula, not of his own devising (KÃ¶lling, pp. 208 sqq.), but
   consisting of the creed of his own Church with an addition intended to
   guard against Sabellianism (Hort, Two Diss. pp. 56, sq. 138). The
   formula was unassailable on the basis of Scripture and of tradition. No
   one had a word to say against it, and the Emperor expressed his
   personal anxiety that it should be adopted, with the single improvement
   of the homoousion. The suggestion thus quietly made was momentous in
   its result. We cannot but recognise the prompter' Hosius behind the
   Imperial recommendation: the friends of Alexander had patiently waited
   their time, and now their time was come: the two Eusebii had placed the
   result in their hands. But how and where was the necessary word to be
   inserted? and if some change must be made in the CÃ¦sarean formula,
   would it not be as well to set one or two other details right? At any
   rate, the creed of Eusebius was carefully overhauled clause by clause,
   and eventually took a form materially different from that in which it
   was first presented [11] , and with affinities to the creeds of Antioch
   and Jerusalem as well as CÃ¦sarea.

   All was now ready; the creed, the result of minute and careful
   deliberations (we do not know their history, nor even how long they
   occupied [12] ), lay before the council. We are told the council
   paused.' The evidence fails us; but it may well have been so. All the
   bishops who were genuinely horrified at the naked Arianism of Eusebius
   of Nicomedia were yet far from sharing the clearsighted definiteness of
   the few: they knew that the test proposed was not in Scripture, that it
   had a suspicious history in the Church. The history of the subsequent
   generation shews that the mind of Eastern Christendom was not wholly
   ripe for its adoption. But the fathers were reminded of the previous
   discussions, of the futility of the Scriptural tests, of the locust and
   the caterpillar, of the whisperings, the nods, winks, and evasions.
   With a great revulsion of feeling the council closed its ranks and
   marched triumphantly to its conclusion. All signed,--all but two,
   Secundus and Theonas. Maris signed and Theognis, Menophantus and
   Patrophilus, and all the rest. Eusebius of Nicomedia signed; signed
   everything, even the condemnation of his own convictions and of his
   genuine fellow-Lucianist' Arius; not the last time that an Arian leader
   was found to turn against a friend in the hour of trial. Eusebius
   justified his signature by a mental reservation;' but we can sympathise
   with the bitter scorn of Secundus, who as he departed to his exile
   warned Eusebius that he would not long escape the same fate (Philost.
   i. 9).

   The council broke up after being entertained by the Emperor at a
   sumptuous banquet in honour of his Vicennalia. The recalcitrant bishops
   with Arius and some others were sent into exile (an unhappy and fateful
   precedent), a fate which soon after overtook Eusebius of Nicomedia and
   Theognis (see the discussion in D.C.B. ii. 364 sq.). But in 329 we find
   Eusebius once more in high favour with Constantine, discharging his
   episcopal functions, persuading Constantine that he and Arius held
   substantially the Creed of NicÃ¦a.'

   The council also dealt with the Paschal question (see Vit. Const. iii.
   18; so far as the question bears on Athanasius see below, p. 500), and
   with the Meletian schism in Egypt. The latter was the main subject of a
   letter (Soc. i. 9; Thdt. i. 9) to the Alexandrian Church. Meletius
   himself was to retain the honorary title of bishop, to remain strictly
   at home, and to be in lay communion for the rest of his life. The
   bishops and clergy of his party were to receive a mustikotera
   cheirotonia (see Bright, Notes on Canons, pp. 25 sqq.; Gore, The Church
   and the Ministry, ed. 1, p. 192 note), and to be allowed to discharge
   their office, but in the strictest subordination to the Catholic Clergy
   of Alexander. But on vacancies occurring, the Meletian incumbents were
   to succeed subject to (1) their fitness, (2) the wishes of the people,
   (3) the approval of the Bishop of Alexandria. The terms were mild, and
   even the gentle nature of Alexander seems to have feared that immediate
   peace might have been purchased at the expense of future trouble (his
   successor openly blames the compromise, p. 131, and more strongly p.
   137); accordingly, before carrying out the settlement he required
   Meletius to draw up an exact list of his clergy at the time of the
   council, so as to bar an indefinite multiplication of claims. Meletius,
   who must have been even less pleased with the settlement than his
   metropolitan, seems to have taken his time. At last nothing would
   satisfy both parties but the personal presentation of the Meletian
   bishops from all Egypt, and of their clergy from Alexandria itself, to
   Alexander (p. 137, toutous kai parontas paredoken to 'Alexandro), who
   was thus enabled to check the Brevium or schedule handed in by their
   chief [13] . All this must have taken a long time after Alexander's
   return, and the peace was soon broken by his death.

   Five months after the conclusion of the negotiations, Alexander having
   now died, the flame of schism broke out afresh (infr. p. 131.
   Montfaucon, in Migne xxv. p. lvii., shews conclusively that the above
   is the meaning of the menas pente.) On his death-bed, Alexander called
   for Athanasius. He was away from Alexandria, but the other deacon of
   that name (see signatures p. 71), stepped forward in answer to the
   call. But without noticing him, the Bishop repeated the name, adding,
   You think to escape, but it cannot be.' (Sozom. ii. 17.) Alexander had
   already written his Easter Letter for the year 328 (it was apparently
   still extant at the end of the century, p. 503). He died on April 17 of
   that year (Pharmuthi 22), and on the eighth of June Athanasius was
   chosen bishop in his stead.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [6] So Eus. Vit. Const. iii. 8--over 270, Eustath. in Thdt. i. 8--in
   fact more than 300 (de Decr. 3), according to Athanasius, who again,
   toward the end of his life (ad Afr. 2) acquiesces in the precise figure
   318 (Gen. xiv. 14; the Greek numeral tie combines the Cross with the
   initial letters of the Sacred Name) which a later generation adopted
   (it first occurs in the alleged Coptic acts of the Council of
   Alexandria, 362, then in the Letter of Liberius to the bishops of Asia
   in 365, infr. Â§9), on grounds perhaps symbolical rather than
   historical.

   [7] The name of Secundus appears among the subscriptions (cf. Soz. i.
   21) but this is contradicted by the primary evidence (Letter of the
   Council in Soc. i. 9, Thdt. i. 9); cf. Philost. i. 9, 10. But there is
   evidence that there were two Secundi.

   [8] A term first brought into currency in this connection by Mr.
   Gwatkin (p. 38, note), and since adopted by many writers including
   Harnack; in spite of the obvious objection to the importations of
   political terms into the grave questions of this period, the term is
   too useful to be surrendered, and the conservatives' of the Post-Nicene
   reaction were in fact too often political in their methods and spirit.
   The truly conservative men, here as in other instances, failed to
   enlist the sympathy of the conservative rank and file.

   [9] The identity of name has certainly done Eusebius no good with
   posterity. But no one with a spark of generosity can fail to be moved
   by the appeal of Socrates (ii. 21) for common fairness toward the dead.

   [10] Or possibly Theodoret, &c., drew a wrong inference from the words
   of Eustathius (in Thdt. i. 8), and the gramma was not submitted by
   Eusebius, but produced as evidence against him; in this case it must
   have been, as Fleury observes, his letter to Paulinus of Tyre.

   [11] , vol. 2, p. 227. The main alterations were (1) The elimination of
   the word logos and substitution of hui& 231;s in the principal place.
   This struck at the theology of Eusebius even more directly than at that
   of Arius. (2) The addition not only of homoousion to patri, but also of
   toutestin ek tes ousias tou patros between monogene and theon as a
   further qualification of gennethenta (specially against Euseb. Nicom.:
   see his letter in Thdt. i. 6). (3) Further explanation of gennethenta
   by g. ou poiethenta, a glance at a favourite argument of Arius, as well
   as at Asterius. (4) enanthropesanta added to explain sarkothenta, and
   so to exclude the Christology which characterised Arianism from the
   first. (5) Addition of anathematisms directed against all the leading
   Arian doctrines.

   [12] The events have been related in what seems to be their most likely
   order, but there is no real certainty in the matter. It is clear that
   there were at least two public sittings (Soz. i. 17, the language of
   Eus. V. C. iii. 10, is reconcileable with this) in the emperor's
   presence, at the first of which the libelli were burned and the bishops
   requested to examine the question of faith. This was probably on June
   19. The tearing up of the creed of Eus. Nic. seems from the account of
   Eustathius to have come immediately before the final adoption of a
   creed. The creed of Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea, which was the basis of that
   finally adopted, must therefore have been propounded after the failure
   of his namesake. (Montfaucon and others are clearly wrong in supposing
   that this was the blasphemy' which was torn to pieces!) The difficulty
   is, where to put the dramatic scene of whisperings, nods, winks, and
   evasions which compelled the bishops to apply a drastic test. I think
   (with KÃ¶lling, &c.) that it must have preceded the proposal of
   Eusebius, upon which the homoousion was quietly insisted on by
   Constantine; for the latter was the only occasion (prophasis) of any
   modification in the CÃ¦sarean Creed, which in itself does not correspond
   to the tests described infr. p. 163. But Montfaucon and others,
   followed by Gwatkin, place the scene in question after the proposal of
   Eus. CÃ¦s. and the resolution to modify his creed by the insertion of a
   stringent test,--in fact at the pause' of the council before its final
   resolution. This conflicts with the clear statement of Eusebius that
   the homoousion was the thin end of the wedge' which led to the entire
   recasting of his creed (see infr. p. 73. The idea of KÃ¶lling, p. 208,
   that the creed of Eusebius was drawn up by him for the occasion, and
   that the mathema of the council was ready beforehand as an alternative
   document, is refuted by the relation of the two documents; see Hort,
   pp. 138, 139). It follows, therefore, from the combined accounts of
   Ath., Euseb. and Eustathius (our only eye-witnesses) that (1) the
   fathers were practically resolved upon the homoousion before the final
   sitting. (2) That this resolve was clinched by the creed of Eusebius of
   Nicomedia. (3) That Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea made his proposal when it was
   too late to think of half-measures. (4) That the creed of Eusebius was
   modified at the Emperor's direction (which presupposes the willingness
   of the Council). (5) That this revision was immediately followed by the
   signatures and the close of the council. The work of revision, however,
   shews such signs of attention to detail that we are almost compelled to
   assume at least one adjournment of the final sitting. When the other
   business of the council was transacted, including the settlement of the
   Easter question, the Meletian schism, and the Canons, it is impossible
   to say. KÃ¶lling suo jure puts them at the first public session. The
   question must be left open, as must that of the presidency of the
   council. The conduct of the proceedings was evidently in the hands of
   Constantine, so that the question of presidency reduces itself to that
   of identifying the bishop on Constantine's right who delivered the
   opening address to the Emperor: this was certainly not Hosius (see Vit.
   C. iii. 11, and vol. 1 of this series, p. 19), but may have been
   Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea, who probably after a few words from Eustathius
   (Thdt.) or Alexander (Theod. Mops. and Philost.) was entrusted with so
   congenial a task. The name of Hosius stands first on the extant list of
   signatures, and he may have signed first, although the lists are bad
   witnesses. The words of Athanasius sometimes quoted in this connection
   (p. 256), over what synod did he not preside?' must be read in
   connection with the distinction made by Theodoret in quoting the
   passage in question (H. E. ii. 15) that Hosius 'was very prominent at
   the great synod of NicÃ¦a, and presided over those who assembled at
   Sardica. This is the only evidence we possess to which any weight can
   be attached.

   [13] It is worth noting that the Nicene arrangement was successful in
   some few cases. See Index to this vol. s.v. Theon (of Nilopolis), &c.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§3 (2). The situation after the Council of NicÃ¦a.

   The council (a) had testified, by its horrified and spontaneous
   rejection of it, that Arianism was a novelty subversive of the
   Christian faith as they had received it from their fathers. They had
   (b) banished it from the Church by an inexorable test, which even the
   leading supporters of Arius had been induced to subscribe. In the years
   immediately following, we find (c) a large majority of the Eastern
   bishops, especially of Syria and Asia Minor, the very regions whence
   the numerical strength of the council was drawn, in full reaction
   against the council; first against the leaders of the victorious party,
   eventually and for nearly a whole generation against the symbol itself;
   the final victory of the latter in the East being the result of the
   slow growth of conviction, a growth independent of the authority of the
   council which it eventually was led to recognise. To understand this
   paradox of history, which determines the whole story of the life of
   Athanasius as bishop, it is necessary to estimate at some length the
   theological and ecclesiastical situation at the close of the council:
   this will best be done by examining each point in turn (a) the novelty
   of Arianism, (b) the homoousion as a theological formula, (c) the
   materials for reaction.

   (a) Arianism was a new doctrine in the Church' (Harnack, p. 218); but
   it claimed to be no novelty. And it was successful for a long time in
   gaining conservative' patronage. Its novelty, as observed above, is
   sufficiently shewn by its reception at the Council of NicÃ¦a. But no
   novelty springs into existence without antecedents. What were the
   antecedents of Arianism? How does it stand related to the history
   within the Church of the momentous question, What think ye of Christ?'

   In examining such a question, two methods are possible. We may take as
   our point of departure the formulated dogma say of NicÃ¦a, and examine
   in the light of it variations in theological statements in preceding
   periods, to shew that they do not warrant us in regarding the dogma as
   an innovation. That is the dogmatic method. Or we may take our start
   from the beginning, and trace the history of doctrine in the order of
   cause and effect, so as to detect the divergence and convergence of
   streams of influence, and arrive at an answer to the question, How came
   men to think and speak as they did? That is the historical method. Both
   methods have their recommendations, and either has been ably applied to
   the problem before us. In electing the latter I choose the more
   difficult road; but I do so with the conviction, firstly, that the
   former has tended (and especially in the ablest hands) to obscure our
   perception of the actual facts, secondly, that the saving faith of
   Christ has everything to gain from a method which appeals directly to
   our sense of historical truth, and satisfies, not merely overawes, the
   mind.

   Let us then go back to the beginning of the Gospel.' Taking the
   synoptic gospels as our primary evidence, we ask, what did Christ our
   Lord teach about Himself? We do not find formal definitions of doctrine
   concerning His Person. Doubtless it may seem that such a definition on
   His part would have saved infinite dispute and searchings of heart in
   the history of the Church. But recognising in Him the unique and
   supreme Revealer of the Father, it is not for us to say what He should
   have taught; we must accept His method of teaching as that which Divine
   Wisdom chose as the best, and its sequel in history as the way in which
   God willed man to learn. We find then in the materials which we possess
   for the history of His Life and Teaching fully enough to explain the
   belief of His disciples (see below) in His Divinity. Firstly, there is
   no serious doubt as to His claim to be the Messiah. (The confession of
   Peter in all four Gospels, Matt. xvi. 16; Mark viii. 29; Luke ix. 27;
   John vi. 69; Son of Man,' Dan. vii. 13; ix. 24, &c.). In this character
   He is King in the kingdom of Heaven (Matt. xxv. 31-36, cf. Mk. viii.
   38), and revises the Law with full authority (Matt. v. 21-44, cf. Luke
   v. 24; Matt. xii. 8). It may be added that whatever this claim conveyed
   to the Jews of His own time (see Stanton's Jewish and Christian
   Messiah) it is impossible to combine in one idea the Old Testament
   traits of the Coming One if we stop short of the identification of the
   Messiah with the God of Israel (see Delitzsch, Psalms, vol. i. pp. 94,
   95, last English ed.). Secondly, Christ enjoys and confers the full
   authority of God (Matt. x. 40; Luke x. 16; cf. also Matt. xxiv. 35; Mk.
   xiii. 31; Luke xxi. 33), gives and promises the Holy Spirit (the Spirit
   of the Father,' see Matt. x. 17, &c.; Luke xii. 12, and especially Luke
   xxi. 15, ego gar doso, &c.), and apparently sends the prophets and holy
   men of old (cf. Matt. xxiii. 34, ego apostello with Luke xi. 49).
   Thirdly, the foundation of all this is laid in a passage preserved by
   the first and third gospels, in which He claims the unqualified
   possession of the mind of the Father (Luke x. 22; Matt. xi. 27), No man
   knoweth [who] the Son [is], save the Father, neither knoweth any man
   [who] the Father [is] save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will
   (bouletai) reveal Him.' Observe the reciprocity of knowledge between
   the Son and the Father. This claim is a decisive instantia foederis
   between the Synoptics and the Fourth Gospel, e.g. John xvi. 15; xiv. 9,
   &c. Fourthly, we observe the claim made by Him throughout the synoptic
   record to absolute confidence, absolute faith, obedience,
   self-surrender, such as no frail man is justified in claiming from
   another; the absence of any trace in the mind of the meek and lowly'
   one of that consciousness of sin, that need of reconciliation with God,
   which is to us an indispensable condition of the religious temper, and
   the starting-point of Christian faith (contrast Isa. vi. 5).

   We now turn to the Apostles. Here a few brief remarks must suffice. (A
   suggestive summary in Sanday, What the first Christians thought about
   Christ,' Oxford House Papers, First Series.) That S. Paul's summary of
   the Gospel (1 Cor. xv. 3 sqq.) is given by him as common ground between
   himself and the older Apostles follows strictly from the fact that the
   verb used (parelabon) links the facts of Redemption (v. 3, 4) with the
   personal experiences of the original disciples (5 sqq.). In fact it is
   not in dispute that the original Jewish nucleus of the Apostolic Church
   preached Jesus as the Messiah, and His death as the ground of
   forgiveness of sins (Pfleiderer, Urchrist. p. 20; Acts ii. 36, 38; iii.
   26; iv. 12, &c.; the Hebraic colouring' of these early chapters is very
   characteristic and important). The question is, however, how much this
   implied as to the Divine Personality of the Saviour; how far the belief
   of the Apostles and their contemporaries was uniform and explicit on
   this point. Important light is thrown on this question by the
   controversy which divided S. Paul from the mass of Jewish Christians
   with respect to the observance of the Law. Our primary source of
   knowledge here is Galatians, ch. ii. We there learn that while S. Paul
   regarded this question as involving the whole essence of the Gospel,
   and resisted every attempt to impose circumcision on Gentile
   Christians, the older Apostles conceded the one point regarded as
   central, and, while reserving the obligation of the Law on those born
   under it (which S. Paul never directly assailed, 1 Cor. vii. 18)
   recognised the Gospel of the uncircumcision as legitimate. This
   concession, as the event proved, conceded everything; if the gospel of
   the uncircumcision' was sufficient for salvation, circumcision became a
   national, not a religious principle. Now this whole question was
   fundamentally a question about Christ. Men who believed, or were
   willing to grant, that the Law uttered from Sinai by the awful voice of
   the Most High Himself was no longer the supreme revelation of God, the
   one divinely ordained covenant of righteousness, certainly believed
   that some revelation of God different in kind (for no revelation of God
   to man could surpass the degree of Ex. xxxiii. 11) had taken place, an
   unique revelation of God in man. The revelation of God in Christ, not
   the revelation of God to Moses, was the one fact in the world's
   history; Sinai was dwarfed in comparison of Calvary. But it must be
   observed that while the older Apostles, by the very recognition of the
   gospel of the uncircumcision, went thus far with S. Paul, S. Paul
   realised as a central principle what to others lay at the
   circumference. What to the one was a result of their belief in Christ
   was to him the starting-point, from which logical conclusions were seen
   to follow, practical applications made in every direction. At the same
   time S. Paul taught nothing about Christ that was not implied in the
   belief of the older Apostles, or that they would not have felt impelled
   by their own religious position to accept. In fact it was their
   fundamental union in the implicit belief of the divinity of the Lord
   that made possible any agreement between S. Paul and the Jewish
   Apostles as to the gospel of the uncircumcision.

   The apostles of the circumcision, however, stood between S. Paul and
   the zealot mass of Jewish Christians (Acts xxi. 20), many of whom were
   far from acquiescing in the recognition of S. Paul's Gospel. On the
   same principle that we have used to determine the belief of the Stuloi
   with regard to Christ, we must needs recognise that where the gospel of
   the uncircumcision was still assailed or disparaged, the Divinity of
   Christ was apprehended faintly, or not at all.

   The name of the Ebionite' sect testifies to its continuity with a
   section of the Jerusalem Church (see Lightfoot's Galatians, S. Paul and
   the Three). It should be observed, however, firstly that between the
   clear-sighted Apostle of the Gentiles and the straitest of the zealots,
   there lay every conceivable gradation of intermediate positions (Loofs,
   Leitf. Â§11. 2, 3); secondly, that while emancipation from legalism in
   the Apostolic Church implied what has been said above, a belief in the
   divinity of Jesus was in itself compatible with strict Jewish
   observance.

   The divinity of Christ then was firmly held by S. Paul (the most
   remarkable passage is Rom. x. 9, 11, 13, where Kurion 'Iesoun = auton =
   Kurion = hvhy Joel ii. 32), and his belief was held by him in common
   with the Jewish Apostles, although with a clearer illumination as to
   its consequences. That this belief was absolutely universal in the
   Church is not to be maintained, the elimination of Ebionism was only
   gradual (Justin, Dial. xlviii. ad fin.); but that it, and not Ebionism,
   represented the common belief of the Apostles and New Testament writers
   is not to be doubted.

   But taking this as proved, we do not find an equally clear answer to
   the question In what sense is Christ God? The synoptic record makes no
   explicit reference to the pre-existence of Christ: but the witness of
   John and descent of the Spirit (Mark i. 7-11) at His baptism, coupled
   with the Virginal Birth (Mt., Lk.), and with the traits of the synoptic
   portrait of Christ as collected above, if they do not compel us to
   assert, yet forbid us to deny the presence of this doctrine to the
   minds of the Evangelists. In the Pauline (including Hebrews) and
   Johannine writings the doctrine is strongly marked, and in the latter
   (Joh. i. 1, 14, 18, monogenes Theos) Jesus Christ is expressly
   identified with the creative Word (Palestinian Memra, rather than
   Alexandrian or from Philo; see also Rev. xix. 13), and the Word with
   God. Moreover such passages as Philipp. ii. 6 sqq., 2 Cor. xiii. 14
   (the Apostolic benediction), &c., &c., are significant of the
   impression left upon the mind of the infant Churches as they started
   upon their history no longer under the personal guidance of the
   Apostles of the Lord.

   Jesus Christ was God, was one with the Father and with the Spirit: that
   was enough for the faith, the love, the conduct of the primitive
   Church. The Church was nothing so little as a society of theologians;
   monotheists and worshippers of Christ by the same instinct, to analyse
   their faith as an intellectual problem was far from their thoughts: God
   Himself (and there is but one God) had suffered for them (Ign. Rom.
   vi.; Tat. Gr. 13; Melito Fr. 7), God's sufferings were before their
   eyes (Clem. R. I. ii. 1), they desired the drink of God, even His blood
   (Ign. Rom. vii., cf. Acts xx. 28); if enthusiastic devotion gave way
   for a moment to reflexion we must think of Jesus Christ as of God'
   (Clem. R.' II. 1).

   The Apostolic fathers' are not theological in their aim or method. The
   earliest seat of theological reflexion in the primitive Church appears
   to have been Asia Minor, or rather Western Asia from Antioch to the
   Ã†gean. From this region proceed the Ignatian letters, which stand alone
   among the literature of their day in theological depth and reflexion.
   Their theology is wonderfully mature in spite of its immaturity, full
   of reflexions, and yet at the same time full of intuitive originality'
   (Loofs, p. 61). The central idea is that of the renovation of man (Eph.
   20), now under the power of Satan and Death (ib. 3, 19), which are
   undone (katalusis) in Christ, the risen Saviour (Smyrn. 3), who is our
   true Life,' and endows us with immortality (Smyrn. 4, Magn. 6, Eph.
   17). This is by virtue of His Divinity (Eph. 19, Smyrn. 4) in union
   with His perfect Manhood. He is the only utterance of God (logos apo
   siges proelthon, Magn. 8), the unlying mouth by which the Father spake'
   (Rom. 8.) God come (genomenos) in the flesh,' our God' (Eph. 7, 18).
   His flesh partaken mystically in the Eucharist unites our nature to
   His, is the medicine of incorruption' (Eph. 20, Smyrn. 7, cf. Trall.
   1). Ignatius does not distinguish the relation of the divine to the
   human in Christ: he is content to insist on both: one Physician, of
   flesh and of spirit, begotten and unbegotten' (Eph. 7). Nor does he
   clearly conceive the relation of the Eternal Son to the Father. He is
   unbegotten (as God) and begotten (as man): from eternity with the
   Father (Magn. 6): through Him the One God manifested himself. The
   theological depth of Ignatius was perhaps in part called forth by the
   danger to the churches from the Docetic heretics, representative of a
   Judaic (Philad. 5, Magn. 8-10) syncretism which had long had a hold in
   Asia Minor (1 John and Lightfoot Coloss., p. 73, 81 sqq.). To this he
   opposes what is evidently a creed (Trall. 9), with emphasis on the
   reality (alethos) of all the facts of Redemption comprised in it.

   It was in fact the controversies of the second century that produced a
   theology in the Catholic Church,--that in a sense produced the Catholic
   Church itself. The idea of the Church as distinct from and embracing
   the Churches is a New Testament idea (Eph. v. 25, cf. 1 Cor. xv. 9,
   &c.), and the name Catholic' occurs at the beginning of the second
   century (Lightfoot's note on Ign. Smyrn. 8); but the Gnostic and
   Montanist controversies compelled the Churches which held fast to the
   paradosis of the Apostles to close their ranks (episcopal federation)
   and to reflect upon their creed. The Baptismal Creed (Rom. x. 9, Acts
   viii. 37, Text. Rec., cf. 1 Cor. xv. 3-4) began to serve as a tessera
   or passport of right belief, and as a regulative standard, a rule of
   faith.' The limits of the Christian Church' began to be more clearly
   defined (Stanton, ubi supr. p. 167).

   Another influence which during the same period led to a gradual
   formation of theology was the necessity of defending the Church against
   heathenism. If the Gnostics were the first Christian theologians'
   (Harnack), the Apologists (120-200) are more directly important for our
   present enquiry. The usual title of Justin Philosopher and Martyr' is
   significant of his position and typical of the class of writers to
   which he belongs. On the one hand the Apologists are philosophers
   rather than theologians. Christianity is the only true philosophy'
   (Justin); its doctrines are found piecemeal among the philosophers
   (logos spermatikos), who are so far Christians, just as the Christians
   are the true philosophers (Justin and Minuc. Felix). But the Logos, who
   is imparted fragmentarily to the philosophers, is revealed in His
   entire divine Personality in Christ (so Justin beyond the others, Apol.
   ii. 8, 10). In the doctrine of God, their thought is coloured by the
   eclectic Platonism of the age before Plotinus. God, the Father of all
   things, is Creator, Lord, Master, and as such known to man, but in
   Himself Unoriginate (agenetos), ineffable, mysterious (arretos),
   without a name, One and alone, incapable of Incarnation (for references
   to Justin and to Plato, D.C.B. iii. 572). His goodness' is metaphysical
   perfection, or beneficence to man, His righteousness' that of Moral
   Governor of the Universe (contrast the deeper sense of St. Paul, Rom.
   iii. 21, &c.). But the abstractness of the conception of God gives way
   to personal vividness in the doctrine of the visible God' (Tert. Prax.
   15 sq.), the Logos (the subject of the O.T. theophanies' according to
   the Apologists) who was with' the Father before all things (Just. Dial.
   62), but was begotten' or projected (probletheis) by the will of the
   Father (ib. 128) as God from God, as a flame from fire. He is, like the
   Father, ineffable (Christos, Just. Apol. ii. 6), yet is the angelos,
   huperetes of the Father. In particular He is the Father's minister in
   Creation: to create He proceeded from the Father, a doctrine expressly
   deduced from Prov. viii. 22 (Dial. 61, 129). Before this He was the
   logos endiathetos, after it the logos prophorikos, the Word uttered
   (Ps. xlv. 1 LXX; this distinction is not in Justin, but is found
   Theophil. ad Autol. ii. 10, 22: it is the most marked trace of
   philosophic [Stoic] influence on the Apologists). The Apologists, then,
   conceive of Christian theology as philosophers. Especially the Person
   of the Saviour is regarded by them from the cosmological, not the
   soteriological view-point. From the latter, as we have seen, St. Paul
   starts; and his view gradually embraces the distant horizon of the
   former (1 Cor. viii. 6, Coloss. i. 15); from the soteriological side
   also (directly) he reaches the divinity of Christ (Rom. v. 1-8; 1 Cor.
   i. 30; Rom. x. 13, as above). Here, as we shall see, Athanasius meets
   the Arians substantially by St. Paul's method. But the Apologists,
   under the influence of their philosophy rather than of their religion,
   start from the cosmological aspect of the problem. They engraft upon an
   Apostolic (Johannine) title of the Saviour an Alexandrine group of
   associations: they go far towards transmuting the Word of St. John to
   the Logos of Philo and the Eclectics. Hence their view of His Divinity
   and of his relation to the Father is embarrassed. His eternity and His
   generation are felt to be hardly compatible: His distinct Personality
   is maintained at the expense of His true Divinity. He is God, and not
   the One God; He can manifest Himself (Theophanies) in a way the One God
   cannot; He is an intermediary between God and the world. The question
   has become philosophical rather than directly religious, and philosophy
   cannot solve it. But on the other hand, Justin was no Arian. If he was
   Philosopher, he was also Martyr. The Apologists are deeply saturated
   with Christian piety and personal enthusiastic devotion to Christ.
   Justin in particular introduces us, as no other so early writer, into
   the life, the worship, the simple faith of the Primitive Church, and we
   can trace in him influences of the deeper theology of Asia Minor
   (Loofs, p. 72 sq. but see more fully the noble article on Justin in
   D.C.B. vol. iii.). But our concern is with their influence on the
   analysis of the object of faith; and here we see that unconsciously
   they have severed the Incarnate Son from the Eternal Father: not God
   (ho ontos theos) but a subordinate divine being is revealed in Christ:
   the Logos, to adopt the words of Ignatius, is no longer a true breach
   of the Divine Silence.

   We must now glance at the important period of developed Catholicism
   marked especially by the names of IrenÃ¦us, Tertullian, and Clement, the
   period of a consolidated organisation, a (relatively) fixed Canon of
   the New Testament, and a catholic rule of faith (see above, and Lumby,
   Creeds, ch. i.; Heurtley, Harmonia Symbolica, i.-viii.). The problem of
   the period which now begins (180-250) was that of Monarchianism; the
   Divinity of Christ must be reconciled with the Unity of God.
   Monarchianism is in itself the expression of the truth common to all
   monotheism, that the arche or Originative Principle is strictly and
   Personally One and one only (in contrast to the plurality of archikai
   hupostaseis, see Newman, Arians^4, p. 112 note). No Christian
   deliberately maintains the contrary. The Apologists, as we have seen,
   tended to emphasise the distinction of Father and Son; but this
   tendency makes of necessity in the direction of subordination;' and any
   distinction of Persons' or Hypostases in the Godhead involves to a
   Monotheist some subordination, in order to save the principle of the
   Divine Monarchia.' The Monarchian denied any subordination or
   distinction of hypostases within the Godhead. This tendency we have now
   to follow up. We do not meet with it as a problem in IrenÃ¦us. (He is
   said to have written against it,' Newman, Ar.^4, p. 117, citing Dodw.
   in Iren.) This scholar of pupils of Apostles stands in the lines of the
   Asiatic theology. He is the successor of Ignatius and Polycarp. We find
   him, in sharp contrast to the Apologists, giving full expression to the
   revelation of God in Jesus (the Son is the Measure of the Father, for
   He contains Him'), and the union of man with God in the Saviour, as the
   carrying out of the original destiny of man, by the destruction of sin,
   which had for the time frustrated it (III. xviii. p. 211, Deus antiquam
   hominis plasmationem in se recapitulans). Hence the deification' of
   man's nature by union with Christ (a remarkable point of contact with
   Athanasius, see note on de Incar. 54. 3); incorruption is attained to
   by the knowledge of God (cf. John xvii. 3) through faith (IV. xx.); we
   cannot comprehend God, but we learn to know Him by His Love (ib.). At
   the same time we trace the influence of the Apologists here and there
   in his Christology (III. 6, 19, and the explanation of the
   Theophanies,' iv. 20). But in his younger contemporary Tertullian, the
   reaction of Monarchianism makes itself felt. He is himself one of the
   Apologists, and at the same time under Asiatic influences. The two
   trains of influence converge in the name Trinitas, which he is the
   first to use (trias first in the Asiatic Apologist Theophilus). In
   combating the Monarchian Praxeas (see below) he carries
   subordinationism very far (cf. Hermog. 3. fuit tempus cum Ei filius non
   fuit'), he distinguishes the Word as rationalis deus' from eternity,
   and sermonalis' not from eternity (cf. again, Theophilus, supra). The
   Generation of the Son is a probole (also eructare' from Ps. xlv. 1),
   but the divine Substance' remains the same (river and fountain, sun and
   ray, Prax. 8, 9). He aims at reconciling subordination' with the
   Monarchia,' (ib. 4). In the Incarnate Christ he distinguishes the
   divine and human as accurately as Leo the Great (ib. 27, 29). In spite
   of inconsistencies such as were inevitable in his strange individuality
   (Stoic, philosopher, lawyer, Apologist, Asiatic' theologian, Catholic,
   Montanist) we see in Tertullian the starting-point of Latin Theology
   (but see also Harnack ii. 287 note).

   We must now examine more closely the history of Monarchian tendencies,
   and firstly in Rome. The sub-Apostolic Church, simply holding the
   Divinity of Christ and the Unity of God, used language (see above)
   which may be called naively Monarchian.' This holds good even of
   Asiatic theology, as we find it in its earlier stage. The baptismal
   creed (as we find it in the primitive basis of the Apostles' Creed)
   does not solve the problem thus presented to Christian reflexion.
   Monarchianism attempted the solution in two ways. Either the One God
   was simply identified with the Christ of the Gospels and the Creeds,
   the Incarnation being a mode of the Divine manifestation (Father as
   Creator, Son as Redeemer, Spirit as Sanctifier, or the like): Modalism'
   or Modalistic Monarchianism (including Patripassianism, Sabellianism,
   and later on the theology of Marcellus); or (this being felt
   incompatible with the constant personal distinction of Christ from the
   Father) a special effluence, influence, or power of the one God was
   conceived of as residing in the man Jesus Christ, who was accordingly
   Son of God by adoption, God by assimilation: dynamic' Monarchianism or
   Adoptionism (Son' and Spirit' not so much modes of the Divine
   self-realisation as of the Divine Action). This letter, the echo but
   not the direct survival of Ebionism, was later on the doctrine of
   Photinus; we shall find it exemplified in Paul of Samosata; but our
   present concern is with its introduction at Rome by the two Theodoti,
   the elder of whom (a tanner from Byzantium) was excommunicated by
   Bishop Victor, while the younger, a student of the Peripatetic
   philosophy and grammatical interpreter of Scripture, taught there in
   the time of Zephyrinus. A later representative of this school, Artemon,
   claimed that its opinions were those of the Roman bishops down to
   Victor (Eus. H. E. v. 28). This statement cannot be accepted seriously;
   but it appears to be founded on a real reminiscence of an epoch in the
   action and teachings of the Roman bishops at the time. It must be
   remembered that the two forms of Monarchianism--modalism and
   adoptionism--are, while very subtly distinguished in their essential
   principle, violently opposed in their appearance to the popular
   apprehension. Their doctrine of God is one, at least in its strict
   unitarianism; but while to the Modalist Christ is the one God, to the
   Adoptionist He is essentially and exclusively man. [14] In the one case
   His Personality is divine, in the other human. Now there is clear proof
   of a strong Modalist tendency [15] in the Roman Church at this time;
   this would manifest itself in especial zeal against the doctrine of
   such men as Theodotus the younger, and give some colour to the tale of
   Artemon. Both Tertullian and Hippolytus complain bitterly of the
   ignorance of those responsible for the ascendancy which this teaching
   acquired in Rome (Zephurinon andra idioten kai apeiron ton
   ekklesiastikon horon, Hipp. idiotes quisque aut perversus,' simplices,
   ne dicam imprudentes et idiotÃ¦.' Tert.). The utterances of Zephyrinus
   support this: I believe in one God, Jesus Christ' (Hipp., see above on
   the language of the sub-Apost. Church). The Monarchian influences were
   strengthened by the arrival of fresh teachers from Asia (Cleomenes and
   Epigonus, see note 2) and began to arouse lively opposition. This was
   headed by Hippolytus, the most learned of the Roman presbytery, and
   eventually bishop [16] in opposition to Callistus, the successor of
   Zephyrinus. The theology of Hippolytus was not unlike that of
   Tertullian, and was hotly charged by Callistus with Ditheism.' The
   position of Callistus himself, like that of his predecessor, was one of
   compromise between the two forms of Monarchianism, but somewhat more
   developed. A distinction was made between Christ' (the divine) and
   Jesus (the human); the latter suffered actually, the former indirectly
   (filius patitur, pater vero compatitur.' (Tert.) ton Patera
   sumpeponthenai to hui& 254;, Hipp.; it is clear that under Praxeas'
   Tertullian is combating also the modified Praxeanism of Callistus. See
   adv. Prax. 27, 29; Hipp. ix. 7); not without reason does Hippolytus
   charge Callistus with combining the errors of Sabellius with those of
   Theodotus. The compromise of Callistus was only partially successful.
   On the one hand the strictly modalist Sabellius, who from about 215
   takes the place of Cleomenes at the head of Roman Monarchianism (his
   doctrine of the huiopator, of the Trinity as successive prosopa,
   aspects,' of the One God, pure modalism as defined above) scorned
   compromise (he constantly reproached Callistus with having changed his
   front, Hipp.) was excommunicated, and became the head of a sect. And
   the fierce opposition of Hippolytus failed to command the support of
   more than a limited circle of enthusiastic admirers, or to maintain
   itself after his death. On the other hand (the process is quite in
   obscurity: see Harnack^1, p. 620) the theology of Hippolytus and
   Tertullian eventually gained the day. Novatian, whose grande volumen'
   (Jer.) on the Trinity represents the theology of Rome about 250 a.d.,
   simply epitomises Tertullian,' and that in explanation of the Rule of
   Faith. As to the Generation of the Son, he drops the quando Ipse
   [Pater] voluit' of Tertullian, but like him combines a (modified)
   subordination' with the communio substantiÃ¦'--in other words the
   homoousion. Monarchianism was condemned in the West; its further
   history belongs to the East (under the name of Sabellianism first in
   Libya: see pp. 173, sqq.). But the hold which it maintained upon the
   Roman Church for about a generation (190-220) left its mark. Rome
   condemned Origen, the ally of Hippolytus; Rome was invoked against
   Dionysius of Alexandria; (Rome and) the West formulated the homoousion
   at NicÃ¦a; Rome received Marcellus; Rome rejected the treis hupostaseis
   and supported the Eustathians at Antioch; it was with Rome rather than
   with the prevalent theology of the East that Athanasius felt himself
   one. (Cf. also Harnack, Dg. 1^1, p. 622 sqq.) Monarchianism was too
   little in harmony with the New Testament, or with the traditional
   convictions of the Churches, to live as a formulated theology. The
   naive modalism' of the simplices quae major semper pars credentium est'
   (Tert.) was corrected as soon as the attempt was made to give it formal
   expression [17] . But the attempt to do so was a valuable challenge to
   the conception of God involved in the system of the Apologists. To
   their abstract, transcendent, philosophical first Principle,
   Monarchianism opposed a living, self-revealing, redeeming God, made
   known in Christ. This was a great gain. But it was obtained at the
   expense of the divine immutability. A God who passed through phases or
   modes, now Father, now Son, now Spirit, a God who could suffer, was not
   the God of the Christians. There is some justice in Tertullian's scoff
   at their Deum versipellem.'

   The third great name associated with the end of the second century,
   that of Clement, is important to us chiefly as that of the teacher of
   Origen, whose influence we must now attempt to estimate. Origen
   (185-254) was the first theologian in the full sense of the term; the
   first, that is, to erect upon the basis of the rule of faith (Preface
   to de Princ.) a complete theological system, synthesising revealed
   religion with a theory of the Universe, of God, of man, which should
   take into account the entire range of truth and knowledge, of faith and
   philosophy. And in this sense for the Eastern Church he was the last
   theologian as well. In the case of Origen the Vincentian epigram,
   absolvuntur magistri condemnantur discipuli (too often applicable in
   the history of doctrine) is reversed. In a modified form his theology
   from the first took possession of the Eastern Church; in the
   Cappadocian fathers it took out a new lease of power, in spite of many
   vicissitudes it conquered opposing forces (the sixth general council
   crushed the party who had prevailed at the fifth); John of Damascus, in
   whom the Eastern Church says its last word, depends upon the Origenist
   theology of Basil and the Gregories. But this theology was Origenism
   with a difference. What was the Origenism of Origen? To condense into
   the compass of our present purpose the many-sidedness of Origen is a
   hopeless task. The reader will turn to the fifth and sixth of Bigg's
   Bampton Lectures for the best recent presentation; to Newman's Arians
   (I. Â§3), especially the apology' at the end); to Harnack (ed. 1, pp.
   510-556) and Loofs (Â§28); Shedd (vol. i. 288-305, should be read before
   Bigg and corrected by him) and Dorner; to the sections in Bull (Defens.
   ii. 9, iii. 3) and Petavius (who in Trin. I. iv. pursues with fluent
   malignity omnigenis errorum portentis infamem scriptorem'); to the
   Origeniana of Huet and the dissertations of the standard editors; to
   the article Origenist Controversies, and to the comprehensive, exact,
   and sympathetic article Origen in the Dictionary of Christian
   Biography. The fundamental works of Origen for our purpose are the de
   Principiis, the contra Celsum, and the de Oratione; but the exegetical
   works are necessary to fill out and correct first impressions.

   The general position of Origen with regard to the Person of Christ is
   akin to that of Hippolytus and Tertullian. It is to some extent
   determined by opposition to Gnosticism and to Monarchianism. His visit
   to Rome (Eus. H. E., vi. 14) coincided with the battle of Hippolytus
   against Zephyrinus and his destined successor: on practical as well as
   on doctrinal points he was at one with Hippolytus. His doctrine of God
   is reached by the soteriological rather than the cosmological method.
   God is known to us in the Incarnate Word; his point of view is moral,
   not...pseudo-metaphysical.' The impassibility of the abstract
   philosophical idea of God is broken into by the passion of Love' (Bigg,
   p. 158). In opposition to the perfection of God lies the material
   world, conditioned by evil, the result of the exercise of will. This
   cause of evil is antecedent to the genesis of the material universe,
   the katabole kosmou; materiality is the penalty and measure of evil.
   (This part of Origen's doctrine is markedly Platonic. Plotinus, we
   read, refused to observe his own birthday; in like manner Origen
   quaintly notes that only wicked men are recorded in Scripture to have
   kept their birthdays; Bigg, 203, note; cf. Harnack, p. 523, note.) The
   soul (psuche as if from psuchesthai) has in a previous state waxed
   cold,' i.e. lost its original integrity, and in this condition enters
   the body, i.e. is subjected to vanity' in common with the rest of the
   creature, and needs redemption (qualify this by Bigg, pp. 202 sqq., on
   Origen's belief in Original Sin). To meet this need the Word takes a
   Soul (but one that has never swerved from Him in its pre-existent
   state: on this antinomy Bigg, 190, note, 199) and mediante Anima, or
   rather mediante hac substantia animÃ¦ (Prin. II. vi.) unites the nature
   of God and of Man in One. (On the union of the two natures in the
   theanthropos, in Ezek. iii. 3, he is as precise as Tertullian: we find
   the Hypostatic Union and Communicatio Idiomatum formally explicit;
   Bigg, 190.) The Word deifies' Human Nature, first His Own, then in
   others as well (Cels. iii. 28, hina genetui theia: he does not use
   theopoieisthai; the thought is subtly but really different from that
   which we found in IrenÃ¦us: see Harnack, p. 551), by that perfect
   apprehension of Him hoper en prin genetai sarx, of which faith in the
   Incarnate is the earliest but not the final stage (applying 2 Cor. v.
   16; cf. the Commentary on the Song of Songs).

   What account then does Origen give of the beginning and the end of the
   great Drama of existence? He starts from the end, which is the more
   clearly revealed; God shall be all in all.' But the end must be like
   the beginning;' One is the end of all, One is the beginning. From 1
   Cor. xv. he works back to Romans viii.: the one is his key to the
   eternity after, the other, to the eternity before (Bigg pp. 193 sq.).
   Into this scheme he brings creation, evil, the history of Revelation,
   the Church and its life, the final consummation of all things. The
   Universe is eternal: God is prior to it in conception, yet He was never
   other than Creator. But in the history of the Universe the material
   world which we know is but a small episode. It began, and will end. It
   began with the estrangement of Will from God, will end with its
   reconciliation: God, from Whom is the beginning of all, will be all in
   all.' (For Origen's eschatology see Bigg, 228-234.) From this point of
   view we must approach the two-sided Christology of Origen. To him the
   two sides were aspects of the same thing: but if the subtle
   presupposition as to God and the Universe is withdrawn, they become
   alternative and inconsistent Christologies, as we shall see to have
   actually happened. As God is eternally Creator, so He is eternally
   Father (Bigg, 160, note). The Son proceeds from Him not as a part of
   His Essence, but as the Ray from the Light; it cannot be rightly or
   piously said that He had a beginning, en hote ouk en (cf. De Princ. i.
   2, iv. 28, and infr. p. 168); He is begotten from the Essence of the
   Father, He is of the same essence (homoousios) (Fragm. 3 in Heb., but
   see Bigg, p. 179), there is no unlikeness whatever between the Son and
   the Father (Princ. i. 2, 12). He was begotten ek tou thelematos tou
   Patros (but to Origen the thelema was inherent in the Divine Nature,
   cf. Bigg. 161, Harnack, p. 534 against Shedd, p. 301, note) not by
   probole or emanation (Princ. iv. 28, i. 2. 4), as though the Son's
   generation were something that took place once for all, instead of
   existing continuously. The Father is in the Son, the Son in the Father:
   there is coinherence.' On the other hand, the Word is God derivatively
   not absolutely, O logos en pros ton Theon, kai Theos en ho Logos. The
   Son is Theos, the Father alone ho Theos. He is of one ousia with the
   Father as compared with the creatures; but as contrasted with the
   Father, Who may be regarded as ep?keina ousias [18] , and Who alone is
   autotheos, autoagathos, alethinos theos, the Son is ho deuteros theos
   (Cels. v. 39, cf. Philo's deutereuon theos). As the Son of God, He is
   contrasted with all geneta; as contrasted with the Ingenerate Father,
   He stands at the head of the series of genneta; He is metaxu tes tou
   agen[n]etou kai tes ton geneton phuseos [19] . He even explains the
   Unity of the Father and the Son as moral (duo te hupostasei pragmata
   hen de te homonoi& 139; kai te tautoteti tou boulematos, Cels. viii.
   12). The Son takes His place even in the cosmic process from Unity to
   Unity through Plurality, God is in every respect One and Simple, but
   the Saviour by reason of the Many becomes Many' (on John i. 22, cf.
   Index to this vol., s.v. Christ). The Spirit is subordinated to the
   Son, the Son to the Father (elatton para ton patera ho hui& 232;s...eti
   de hetton to pneuma to hagion, Princ. I. 3, 5 Gk.), while to the Spirit
   are subordinated created spirits, whose goodness is relative in
   comparison with God, and the fall of some of whom led to the creation
   of matter (see above). Unlike the Son and the Spirit they are mutable
   in will, subject to prokope, capable of embodiment even if in
   themselves immaterial.

   The above slender sketch of the leading thoughts of Origen will suffice
   to show how intimately his doctrine of the Person of Christ hangs
   together with his philosophy of Religion and Nature. That philosophy is
   the philosophy of his age, and must be judged relatively. His deeply
   religious, candid, piercing spirit embodies the highest effort of the
   Christian intellect conditioned by the categories of the best thought
   of his age. Everywhere, while evading no difficulty, his strenuous
   speculative search is steadied by ethical and religious instinct. As
   against Valentinian and the Platonists, with both of whom he is in
   close affinity, he inexorably insists on the self-consciousness and
   moral nature of God, on human freewill. As against all contemporary
   non-Christian thought his system is pure monism. Yet the problem of
   evil, in which he merges the antithesis of matter and spirit, brings
   with it a necessary dualism, a dualism, however, which belongs but to a
   moment in the limitless eternity of God's all-in-allness before and
   after. Is he then a pantheist? No, for to him God is Love (in Ezek. vi.
   6), and the rational creature is to be made divine and united to God by
   the reconciliation of Will and by conscious apprehension of Him. The
   idea of Will is the pivot of Origen's system, the centripetal force
   which forbids it to follow the pantheistic line which it yet
   undoubtedly touches. The moral' unity of the Father and the Son (see
   above, tautotes boulematos and ek tou thelematos) is Unity in that very
   respect in which the Creator stands over against the self-determining
   rational creature. Yet the immutability, the Oneness of God, must be
   reconciled with the plurality, the mutability of the creature; here the
   Logos mediates; dia ta polla ginetai polla: but this must be from
   eternity:--accordingly creation is eternal too. Here we see that the
   cosmological idea has prevailed over the religious, the Logos of Origen
   is still in important particulars the Logos of the Apologists, of Philo
   and the philosophers. The difference lies in His co-eternity, upon
   which Origen insists without wavering. The resemblance lies in the
   intermediate [20] position ascribed to Him between the agennetos, (ho
   Theos), and the geneta; He is, as Hypostasis, subordinate to the
   Father.

   Now it is evident that the mere intellectual apprehension of a system
   which combines so many opposite tendencies, which touches every variety
   of the theological thought of the age (even modalism, for to Origen the
   Father is the Monas, the autotheos, while yet He is no abstraction but
   a God who exists in moral activity, supra) and subtly harmonises them
   all, must have involved no ordinary philosophical power. When we add to
   this fact the further consideration that precisely the fundamental
   ideas of Origen were those which called forth the liveliest opposition
   and were gradually dropped by his followers, we can easily understand
   that in the next generation Origenism was no longer either the system
   of Origen, or a single system at all.

   In one direction it could lend itself to no compromise; in spite of the
   justice done by Origen to the fundamental ideas both of modalism and of
   emanative adoptionism (cf. Harnack, pp. 548, note, and 586), to
   Monarchianism in either form he is diametrically opposed. The
   hypostatic distinctness of Son and Spirit is once for all made good for
   the theology of Eastern Christendom. We see his disciples exterminate
   Monarchianism in the East. On the left wing Dionysius refutes the
   Sabellians of Libya, on the right Gregory Thaumaturgus, Firmilian, and
   their brethren, after a long struggle, oust the adoptionist Paul from
   the See of Antioch. But its influence on the existing Catholic
   theology, however great (and in the East it was very great), inevitably
   made its way in the face of opposition, and at the cost of its original
   subtle consistency. The principal opposition came from Asia Minor,
   where the traditions of theological thought (see above, on Ignatius and
   IrenÃ¦us, below on Marcellus) were not in sympathy [21] with Origen. We
   cannot demonstrate the existence of a continuous theological school in
   Asia; but Methodius (270-300) certainly speaks with the voice of
   Ignatius and IrenÃ¦us. He deals with Origen much as IrenÃ¦us dealt with
   the Gnostics, defending against him the current sense of the regula
   fidei, and especially the literal meaning of Scripture, the origination
   of the soul along with the body, the resurrection of the body in the
   material sense, and generally opposing realism to the spiritualism of
   Origen. But in thus opposing Origen, Methodius is not uninfluenced by
   him (see Socr. vi. 13). He, too, is a student of Plato (with little of
   his style or spirit'); his realism' is speculative.' He no longer
   defends the Asiatic Chiliasm, his doctrine of the Logos is coloured by
   Origen as that of IrenÃ¦us was by the Apologists. The legacy of
   Methodius and of his Origenist contemporaries to the Eastern Church was
   a modified Origenism, that is a theology systematised on the
   intellectual basis of the Platonic philosophy, but expurgated by the
   standard of the regula fidei. This result was a compromise, and was at
   first attended with great confusion. Origen's immediate following
   seized some one side, some another of his system; some were more, some
   less influenced by the orthodox' reaction against his teaching. We may
   distinguish an Origenist right' and an Origenist left.' If the
   Origenist view of the Universe was given up, the coeternity of the Son
   and Spirit with the Father was less firmly grasped. Origen had, if we
   may use the expression, levelled up.' The Son was mediator between the
   Ingenerate God and the created, but eternal Universe. If the latter was
   not eternal, and if at the same time the Word stood in some essential
   correlation to the creative energy of God, Origen's system no longer
   implied the strict coeternity of the Word. Accordingly we find
   Dionysius (see below, p. 173 sqq.) uncertain on this point, and on the
   essential relation of the Son to the Father. More cautious in this
   respect, but tenacious of other startling features of Origen, were
   Pierius and Theognostus, who presided over the Catechetical School at
   the end of the century [22] .

   On the other hand, very many of Origen's pupils, especially among the
   bishops, started from the other side of Origen's teaching, and held
   tenaciously to the coeternity of the Son, while they abandoned the
   Origenist paradoxes' with regard to the Universe, matter,
   pre-existence, and restitution. Typical of this class is Gregory
   Thaumaturgus, also Peter the martyr bishop of Alexandria, who expressly
   opposed many of Origen's positions (though hardly with the violence
   ascribed to him in certain supposed fragments in Routh, Rell. iv. 81)
   and Alexander himself. It was this wing' of the Origenist following
   that, in combination with the opposition represented by Methodius,
   bequeathed to the generation contemporary with NicÃ¦a its average
   theological tone. The coeternity of the Son with the Father was not (as
   a rule) questioned, but the essential relation of the Logos to the
   Creation involved a strong subordination of the Son to the Father, and
   by consequence of the Spirit to the Son. Monarchianism was the heresy
   most dreaded, the theology of the Church was based on the philosophical
   categories of Plato applied to the explanation and systematisation of
   the rule of faith. This was very far from Arianism. It lacked the
   logical definiteness of that system on the one hand, it rested on the
   other hand on a different conception of God; the hypostatic
   subordination of the Son was insisted upon, but His true Sonship as of
   one Nature with the Father, was held fast. In the slow process of time
   this neo-Asiatic theology found its way partly to the Nicene formula,
   partly to the illogical acceptance of it with regard to the Son, with
   refusal to apply it to the Spirit (Macedonius). To the men who thought
   thus, the blunt assertion that the Son was a creature, not coeternal,
   alien to the Essence of the Father, was a novelty, and wholly
   abhorrent. Arius drew a sharper line than they had been accustomed to
   draw between God and the creature; so did Athanasius. But Arius drew
   his line without flinching between the Father and the Son. This to the
   instinct of any Origenist was as revolting as it would have been to the
   clear mind and Biblical sympathy of Origen himself. In theological and
   philosophical principles alike Arius was opposed even to the tempered
   Origenism of the Nicene age. The latter was at the furthest remove from
   Monarchianism, Arianism was in its essential core Monarchian; the
   common theology borrowed its philosophical principles and method from
   the Platonists, Arius from Aristotle. To anticipate, Arianism and
   (so-called) semi-Arianism have in reality very little in common except
   the historical fact of common action for a time. Arianism guarded the
   transcendence of the divine nature (at the expense of revelation and
   redemption) in a way that semi-Arianism,' admitting as it did inherent
   inequality in the Godhead, did not. They therefore tended in opposite
   directions; Arianism to Anomoeanism, semi-Arianism' to the Nicene
   faith; their source was different. Aristotle made men Arians,' says
   Newman with truth, Plato, semi-Arians' (Arians^4, p. 335, note): but to
   say this is to allow that if Arianism goes back to Lucian and so to
   Paul of Samosata, semi-Arianism is a fragment from the wreck of Origen.

   The Origenist bishops of Syria and Asia Minor had in the years 269-272,
   after several efforts, succeeded in deposing Paul of Samosata from the
   See of Antioch. This remarkable man was the ablest pre-Nicene
   representative of Adoptionist Monarchianism. The Man Jesus was
   inhabited by the Word,' i.e. by an impersonal power of God, distinct
   from the Logos or reason (wisdom) inherent in God as an attribute,
   which descended upon him at His Baptism. His union with God, a union of
   Will, was unswerving, and by virtue of it He overcame the sin of
   mankind, worked miracles, and entered on a condition of Deification. He
   is God ek prokopes (cf. Luke ii. 52) by virtue of progress in
   perfection. That is in brief the system of Paul, and we cannot wonder
   at his deposition. For the striking points of contact with Arianism
   (two Wisdoms,' two Words,' prokope: cf. Orat. c. Ar. i. 5, &c.) we have
   to account [23] . The theology of Arius is a compromise between the
   Origenist doctrine of the Person of Christ and the pure Monarchian
   Adoptionism of Paul of Samosata; or rather it engrafts the former upon
   the latter as the foundation principle, seriously modifying each to
   suit the necessity of combining the two. This compromise was not due to
   Arius himself but to his teacher, Lucian the Martyr. A native himself
   of Samosata, he stood in some relation of attachment (not clearly
   defineable) to Paul. Under him, he was at the head of a critical,
   exegetical, and theological school at Antioch. Upon the deposition of
   Paul he appears not so much to have been formally excommunicated as to
   have refused to acquiesce in the new order of things. Under Domnus and
   his two successors, he was in a state of suspended communion [24] ; but
   eventually was reconciled with the bishop (Cyril?) and died as a martyr
   at Nicomedia, Jan. 7, 312. The latter fact, his ascetic life, and his
   learning secured him widespread honour in the Church; his pupils formed
   a compact and enthusiastic brotherhood, and filled many of the most
   influential Sees after the persecution. That such a man should be
   involved in the reproach of having given birth to Arianism is an
   unwelcome result of history, but one not to be evaded [25] . The
   history of the Lucianic compromise and its result in the Lucianic type
   of theology, are both matters of inference rather than of direct
   knowledge. As to the first, whatever evidence there is connects
   Lucian's original position with Paul. His reconciliation with Bishop
   Cyril must have involved a reapproachment to the formula of the bishops
   who deposed Paul,--a thoroughly Origenist document. We may therefore
   suppose that the identification of Christ with the Logos, or cosmic
   divine principle, was adopted by him from Origenist sources. But he
   could not bring himself to admit that He was thus essentially
   identified with God the eternal; he held fast to the idea of prokope as
   the path by which the Lord attained to Divinity; he distinguished the
   Word or Son who was Christ from the immanent impersonal Reason or
   Wisdom of God, as an offspring of the Father's Will, an idea which he
   may have derived straight from Origen, with whom of course it had a
   different sense. For to Origen Will was the very essence of God; Lucian
   fell back upon an arid philosophical Monotheism, upon an abstract God
   fenced about with negations (Harnack 2^2, 195, note) and remote from
   the Universe. It was counted a departure from Lucian's principles if a
   pupil held that the Son was the perfect Image of the Father's Essence'
   (Philost. ii. 15); Origen's formula, distinct in hypostasis, but one in
   will,' was apparently exploited in a Samosatene sense to express the
   relation of the Son to the Father. The only two points in fact in which
   Lucian appears to have modified the system of Paul were, firstly in
   hypostatising the Logos, which to Paul was an impersonal divine power,
   secondly in abandoning Paul's purely human doctrine of the historical
   Christ. To Lucian, the Logos assumed a body (or rather Deus sapientiam
   suam misit in hunc mundum carne vestitam, ubi infra, p. 6), but itself
   took the place of a soul [26] ; hence all the tapeinai lexeis of the
   Gospels applied to the Logos as such, and the inferiority and essential
   difference of the Son from the Father rigidly followed.

   The above account of Lucian is based on that of Harnack, Dogmg. ii.
   184, sqq. It is at once in harmony with all our somewhat scanty data
   (Alexander, Epiphanius, Philostorgius, and the fragment of his last
   confession of faith preserved by Rufin. in Eus. H. E. ix. 9, Routh,
   Rell. iv. pp. 5-7, from which Harnack rightly starts) and is the only
   one which accounts for the phenomena of the rise of Arianism. We find a
   number of leading Churchmen in agreement with Arius, but in no way
   dependent on him. They are Eusebius of Nicomedia, Maris, Theognis,
   Athanasius of Anazarba, Menophantus; all Lucianists. The first Arian
   writer, Asterius (see below), is a Lucianist. (The Egyptian bishops
   Secundus and Theonas cannot be put down to any school; we do not know
   their history; but they are distinguished from the Lucianists by
   Philost. ii. 3.) It has been urged that, although Arius brought away
   heresy from the school of Lucian, yet he was not the only one that did
   so. True; but then the heresy was all of the same kind (list of pupils
   of Lucian in Philost. ii. 14, iii. 15). Aetius, the founder of logical
   ultra-Arianism and teacher of Eunomius, was taught the exegesis of the
   New Testament by the Lucianists Athanasius of Anazarba and Antony of
   Tarsus, of the Old by the Lucianist Leontius. This fairly covers the
   area of Arianism proper. But it may be noted that some Origenists of
   the left wing,' whose theology emphasized the subordination, and
   vacillated as to the eternity of the Son, would find little to shock
   them in Arianism (Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea, Paulinus of Tyre), while on the
   other hand there are traces of a Lucianist right wing,' men like
   Asterius, who while essentially Arian, made concessions to the
   conservative' position chiefly by emphasising the cosmic mediation of
   the Word and His exact likeness' to the Father [27] . The Theology of
   the Eastern Church was suffering from the effort to assimilate the
   Origenist theology: it could not do so without eliminating the
   underlying and unifying idea of Origenism; this done, the overwhelming
   influence of the great teacher remained, while dissonant fragments of
   his system, vaguely comprehended in many cases, permeated some here,
   some there [28] . Meanwhile the school of Lucian had a method and a
   system; they knew their own minds, and relied on reason and exegesis.
   This was the secret of their power. Had Arius never existed, Arianism
   must have tried its strength under such conditions. But the age was
   ready for Arius; and Arius was ready. The system of Arius was in effect
   that of Lucian: its formulation appears to have been as much the work
   of Asterius as of Arius himself. (Cf. p. 155, Â§8, ho de 'Ar.
   metagrapsas dedoke tois idiois. The extant writings of Arius are his
   letters to Eus. Nic. and to Alexander, preserved by Theodoret and
   Epiph. HÃ¦r. 69, and the extracts from the Thalia' in Ath., pp. 308-311,
   457, 458; also the confession' in Socr. i. 26, Soz. ii. 27. Cf. also
   references to his dicta in Ath. pp. 185, 229, &c.) Arius started from
   the idea of God and the predicate Son.' God is above all things
   uncreated, or unoriginate, agen[n]etos, (the ambiguity of the
   derivatives of gennasthai and genesthai are a very important element in
   the controversy. See p. 475, note 5, and Lightfoot, Ignat. ii. p. 90
   sqq.) Everything else is created, geneton. The name Son' implies an act
   of procreation. Therefore, before such act, there was no Son, nor was
   God properly speaking a Father. The Son is not coeternal with Him. He
   was originated by the Father's will, as indeed were all things. He is,
   then, ton geneton, He came into being from non-existence (ex ouk
   onton), and before that did not exist (ouk en prin genetai). But His
   relation to God differs from that of the Universe generally. Created
   nature cannot bear the awful touch of bare Deity. God therefore created
   the Son that He in turn might be the agent in the Creation of the
   Universe--created Him as the beginning of His ways,' (Prov. viii. 22,
   LXX.). This being so, the nature of the Son was in the essential point
   of agennesia unlike that of the Father; (xenos tou huiou kat' ousian ho
   Pater hoti anarchos): their substances (hupostaseis) are
   anepimiktoi,--have nothing in common. The Son therefore does not
   possess the fundamental property of sonship, identity of nature with
   the Father. He is a Son by Adoption, not by Nature; He has advanced by
   moral probation to be Son, even to be monogenes theos (Joh. i. 14). He
   is not the eternal Logos, reason, of God, but a Word (and God has
   spoken many): but yet He is the Word by grace; is no longer, what He is
   by nature, subject to change. He cannot know the Father, much less make
   Him known to others. Lastly, He dwells in flesh, not in full human
   nature (see above, p. xxviii. and note 2). The doctrine of Arius as to
   the Holy Spirit is not recorded, but probably He was placed between the
   Son and the other ktismata (yet see Harnack ii. 199, note 2).

   Arian Literature. Beside the above-mentioned letters and fragments of
   Arius, our early Arian documents are scanty. Very important is the
   letter of Eus. Nic. to Paulinus, referred to above, Â§3 (1), pp. xvi.,
   xviii., other fragments of letters, p. 458 sq. The writings [29] of
   Asterius, if preserved, would have been an invaluable source of
   information [30] . Asterius seems to have written before the Nicene
   Council; he may have modified his language in later treatises. He was
   replied to by Marcellus in a work which brought him into controversy
   (336) with Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea. With the creeds and Arian literature
   after the death of Constantine we are not at present concerned.

   Arianism was a novelty. Yet it combines in an inconsistent whole
   elements of almost every previous attempt to formulate the doctrine of
   the Person of Christ. Its sharpest antithesis was Modalism: yet with
   the modalist Arius maintained the strict personal unity of the Godhead.
   With dynamic monarchianism it held the adoptionist principle in
   addition; but it personified the Word and sacrificed the entire
   humanity of Christ. In this latter respect it sided with the DocetÃ¦,
   most Gnostics, and ManichÃ¦ans, to all of whom it yet opposes a
   sharply-cut doctrine of creation and of the transcendence of God. With
   Origen and the Apologists before him it made much of the cosmic
   mediation of the Word in contrast to the redemptive work of Jesus; with
   the Apologists, though not with Origen, it enthroned in the highest
   place the God of the Philosophers: but against both alike it drew a
   sharp broad line between the Creator and the Universe, and drew it
   between the Father and the Son. Least of all is Arianism in sympathy
   with the theology of Asia,--that of Ignatius, IrenÃ¦us, Methodius,
   founded upon the Joannine tradition. The profound Ignatian idea of
   Christ as the Logos apo siges proelthon is in impressive contrast with
   the shallow challenge of the Thalia, Many words hath God spoken, which
   of these was manifested in the flesh?'

   Throughout the controversies of the pre-Nicene age the question felt
   rather than seen in the background is that of the Idea of God. The
   question of Monotheism and Polytheism which separated Christians from
   heathen was not so much a question of abstract theology as of religion,
   not one of speculative belief, but of worship. The Gentile was prepared
   to recognise in the background of his pantheon the shadowy form of one
   supreme God, Father of gods and men, from whom all the rest derived
   their being. But his religion required the pantheon as well; he could
   not worship a philosophic supreme abstraction. The Christian on the
   other hand was prepared in many cases to recognise the existence of
   beings corresponding to the gods of the heathen (whether 1 Cor. viii. 5
   can be quoted here is open to question). But such beings he would not
   worship. To him, as an object of religion, there was one God. The one
   God of the heathen was no object of practical personal religion; the
   One God of the Christian was. He was the God of the Old Testament, the
   God who was known to His people not under philosophical categories, but
   in His dealings with them as a Father, Deliverer, He who would
   accomplish all things for them that waited on Him, the God of the
   Covenant. He was the God of the New Testament, God in Christ
   reconciling the world to Himself, manifesting His Righteousness in the
   Gospel of Christ to whosoever believed. In Christ the Christian learned
   that God is Love. Now this knowledge of God is essentially religious;
   it lies in a different plane from the speculative aporiai as to God's
   transcendence or immanence, while yet it steadies the religious mind in
   the face of speculations tending either way. A God who is Love, if
   immanent, must yet be personal, if transcendent, must yet manifest His
   Love in such a way that we can know it and not merely guess it. Now as
   Christian instinct began to be forced to reflexion, in other words, as
   faith began to strive for expression in a theology [31] , it could not
   but be that men, however personally religious, seized hold of religious
   problems by their speculative side. We have seen this exemplified in
   the influence of Platonic philosophy on the Apologists and Alexandrine
   Fathers. But to Origen, with all his Platonism, belongs the honour of
   enthroning the God of Love at the head and centre of a systematic
   theology. Yet the theology of the end of the third century assimilated
   secondary results of Origen's system rather than his underlying idea.
   On the one hand was the rule of faith with the whole round of Christian
   life and worship, determining the religious instinct of the Church; on
   the other, the inability to formulate this instinct in a coherent
   system so long as the central problem was overlooked or inadequately
   dealt with. God is One, not more; yet how is the One God to be
   conceived of, what is His relation to the Universe of genesis and
   phthora? and the Son is God, and the Spirit; how are they One, and if
   One how distinct? How do we avoid the relapse into a polytheism of
   secondary gods? What is--not the essential nature of Godhead, for all
   agreed that that is beyond our ken--but the proton hemin, the essential
   idea for us to begin from if we are to synthesise belief and theology,
   pistis and gnosis?

   Arianism stepped in with a summary answer. God is one, numerically and
   absolutely. He is beyond the ken of any created intelligence. Even
   creation is too close a relation for Him to enter into with the world.
   In order to create, he must create an instrument (pp. 360 sqq.),
   intermediate between Himself and all else. This instrument is called
   Son of God, i.e. He is not coeternal (for what son was ever as old as
   his parent?), but the result of an act of creative will. How then is He
   different from other creatures? This is the weak point of the system;
   He is not really different, but a difference is created by investing
   Him with every possible attribute of glory and divinity except the
   possession of the incommunicable nature of deity. He is merely anointed
   above His fellows.' His divinity' is acquired, not original; relative,
   not absolute; in His character, not in His Person. Accordingly He is,
   as a creature, immeasurably far from the Creator; He does not know God,
   cannot declare God to us. The One God remains in His inaccessible
   remoteness from the creature. But yet Arians worshipped Christ;
   although not very God, He is God to us. Here we have the exact
   difficulty with which the Church started in her conflict with
   heathenism presented again unsolved. The desperate struggle, the hardly
   earned triumph of the Christians, had been for the sake of the
   essential principle of heathenism! The One God was, after all, the God
   of the philosophers; the idea of pagan polytheism was realised and
   justified in Christ [32] ! To this Athanasius returns again and again
   (see esp. p. 360); it is the doom of Arianism as a Christian theology.

   If Arianism failed to assist the thought of the Church to a solution of
   the great problem of God, its failure was not less conspicuous with
   regard to revelation and redemption. The revelation of the Gospel
   stopped short in the person of Christ, did not go back to the Father.
   God was not in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, we have access
   in Christ to a created intelligence, not to the love of God to usward,
   not to the everlasting Arms, but to a being neither divine nor human.
   Sinners against heaven and before God, we must accept an assurance of
   reconciliation from one who does not know Him whom we have offended;
   the kiss of the Father has never been given to the prodigal. Men have
   asked how we are justified in ascribing to the infinite God the
   attributes which we men call good: mercy, justice, love. If Christ is
   God, the answer lies near; if He is the Christ of Arius, we are left in
   moral agnosticism. Apart from Christ, the philosophical arguments for a
   God have their force; they proffer to us an ennobling belief, a grand
   perhaps'; but the historical inability of Monotheism to retain a
   lasting hold among men apart from revelation is an impressive
   commentary on their compelling power. In Christ alone does God lay hold
   upon the soul with the assurance of His love (Rom. v. 5-8; Matt. xi.
   28; John xvii. 3). The God of Arius has held out no hand toward us; he
   is a far-off abstraction, not a living nor a redeeming God.

   The illogicality of Arianism has often been pointed out (Gwatkin, pp.
   21 sqq. esp. p. 28); how, starting from the Sonship of Christ, it came
   round to a denial of His Sonship; how it started with an interest for
   Monotheism and landed in a vindication of polytheism; how it began from
   the incomprehensibility of God even to His Son, and ended (in its most
   pronounced form) with the assertion that the divine Nature is no
   mystery at all, even to us. It is an insult to the memory of Aristotle
   to call such shallow hasty syllogising from ill-selected and unsifted
   first principles by his name. Aristotle himself teaches a higher logic
   than this. But at this date Aristotelianism proper was extinct. It only
   survived in the form of pure' logic, adopted by the Platonists, but
   also studied for its own sake in connection with rhetoric and the art
   of arguing (cf. Socr. ii. 35). Such an instrument might well be a cause
   of confusion in the hands of men who used it without regard to the
   conditions of the subject-matter. An illogical compromise between the
   theology of Paul of Samosata and of Origen, the marvel is that Arianism
   satisfied any one even in the age of its birth. What has been said
   above with regard to the conception of God in the early Church may help
   to explain it; the germ of ethical insight which is latent in
   adoptionism, and which when neglected by the Church has always made
   itself felt by reaction, must also receive justice; once again, its
   inherent intellectualism was in harmony with the dominant theology of
   the Eastern Church, that is with one side of Origenism. Where analogous
   conditions have prevailed, as for example in the England of the early
   eighteenth century, Arianism has tended to reappear with no one of its
   attendant incongruities missing.

   But for all that, the doom of Arianism was uttered at NicÃ¦a and
   verified in the six decades which followed. Every possible alternative
   formula of belief as to the Person of Christ was forced upon the mind
   of the early Church, was fully tried, and was found wanting. Arianism
   above all was fully tried and above all found lacking. The Nicene
   formula alone has been found to render possible the life, to satisfy
   the instincts of the Church of Christ. The choice lies--nothing is
   clearer--between that and the doctrine of Paul of Samosata. The latter,
   it has been said, was misunderstood, was never fairly tried. As a
   claimant to represent the true sense of Christianity it was I think
   once for all rejected when the first Apostles gave the right hand of
   fellowship to S. Paul (see above, p. xxii.); its future trial must be
   in the form of naturalism, as a rival to Christianity, on the basis of
   a denial of the claim of Christ to be the One Saviour of the World, and
   of His Gospel to be the Absolute Religion. But Arianism, adding to all
   the difficulties of a supernatural Christology the spirit of the
   shallowest rationalism and the fundamental postulate of agnosticism,
   can surely count for nothing in the Armageddon of the latter days,

   Spiacente a Dio ed a' nemici suoi.

   (b) The homoousion as a theological formula [33] .

   The distinction, which in the foregoing discussion we have frequently
   had under our notice, between the pistis and gnosis of the early
   Church, the pistis common to all, and formulated in the tessera or rule
   of faith, the gnosis the property of apologists and theologians aiming
   at the expression of faith in terms of the thought of their age, and at
   times, though for long only slightly, reacting upon the rule of faith
   itself (Aquileia, CÃ¦sarea, Gregory Thaumaturgus), makes itself felt in
   the account of the Nicene Council. That the legacy of the first
   world-wide gathering of the Church's rulers is a Rule of Faith moulded
   by theological reflexion, one in which the gnosis of the Church
   supplements her pistis, is a momentous fact; a fact for which we have
   to thank not Athanasius but Arius. The pistis of the Fathers repudiated
   Arianism as a novelty; but to exclude it from the Church some test was
   indispensable; and to find a test was the task of theology, of gnosis.
   The Nicene Confession is the Rule of Faith explained as against
   Arianism. Arianism started with the Christian profession of belief in
   our Lord's Sonship. If the result was incompatible with such belief, it
   was inevitable that an explanation should be given, not indeed of the
   full meaning of divine Sonship, but of that element in the idea which
   was ignored or assailed by the misconception of Arius. Such an
   explanation is attempted in the words ek tes ousias tou patros,
   homoousian to Patri, and again in the condemnation of the formula ex
   heteras hupostaseos e ousias. This explanation was not adopted without
   hesitation, nor would it have been adopted had any other barrier
   against the heresy, which all but very few wished to exclude, appeared
   effective. We now have to examine firstly the grounds of this
   hesitation, secondly the justification of the formula itself.

   The objections felt to the word homoousion at the council were (1)
   philosophical, based on the identification of ousia with either eidos
   (i.e. as implying a formal essence' prior to Father and Son alike) or
   hule; (2) dogmatic, based on the identification of ousia with tode ti,
   and on the consequent Sabellian sense of the homoousion; (3)
   Scriptural, based on the non-occurrence of the word in the Bible; (4)
   Ecclesiastical, based on the condemnation of the word by the Synod
   which deposed Paul at Antioch in 269.

   All these objections were made and felt bona fide, although Arians
   would of course make the most of them. The subsequent history will show
   that their force was outweighed only for the moment with many of the
   fathers, and that to reconcile the conservatism' of the Asiatic bishops
   to the new formula must be a matter of time. The third or Scriptural
   objection need not now be discussed at length. Precedent could be
   pleaded for the introduction into creeds of words not expressly found
   in Scripture (e.g. the word catholic' applied to the Church in many
   ancient creeds, the creed of Gregory Thaumaturgus with trias teleia,
   &c. &c.); the only question was, were the non-scriptural words
   expressive of a Scriptural idea? This was the pith of the question
   debated between Athanasius and his opponents for a generation after the
   council; the conservative' majority eventually came round to the
   conviction that Athanasius was right. But the question depends upon the
   meaning of the word itself.

   The word means sharing in a joint or common essence, ousia (cf.
   homonumos, sharing the same name, &c. &c.). What then is ousia? The
   word was introduced into philosophical use, so far as we know, by
   Plato, and its technical value was fixed for future ages by his pupil
   Aristotle. Setting aside its use to express existence' in the abstract,
   we take the more general use of the word as indicating that which
   exists in the concrete. In this sense it takes its place at the centre
   of his system of categories,' as the something to which all
   determinations of quality, quantity, relation and the rest attach, and
   which itself attaches to nothing; in Aristotle's words it alone is
   self-existent, choriston, whereas all that comes under any of the other
   categories is achoriston, non-existent except as a property of some
   ousia. But here the difficulty begins. We may look at a concrete term
   as denoting either this or that individual simply (tode ti), or as
   expressing its nature, and so as common to more individuals than one.
   Now properly (protos) ousia is only appropriate to the former purpose.
   But it may be employed in a secondary sense to designate the latter; in
   this sense species and genera are deuterai ousiai, the wider class
   being less truly ousiai than the narrower. In fact we here detect the
   transition of the idea of ousia from the category of ousia proper to
   that of poion (cf. Athan. p. 478 sq.; he uses ousia freely in the
   secondary sense for non-theological purposes in contra Gentes, where it
   is often best rendered nature'). Aristotle accordingly uses ousia
   freely to designate what we call substances, whether simple or
   compound, such as iron, gold, earth, the heavens, to akineton, &c., &c.
   Corresponding again, to the logical distinction of genos and eidos is
   the metaphysical distinction (not exactly of matter and form, but) of
   matter simply, regarded as to hupokeimenon, and matter regarded as
   existing in this or that form, to poion to en te ousi& 139;, to ti en
   einai, the meeting-point of logic and metaphysics in Aristotle's
   system. Agreeably to this distinction, ousia is used sometimes of the
   latter--the concrete thing regarded in its essential nature, sometimes
   of the former he hupokeimene ousia hos hule, hule being in fact the
   summum genus of the material world.

   Now the use of the word in Christian theology had exemplified nearly
   every one of the above senses. In the quasi-material sense homoousion
   had been used in the school of Valentinian to express the homogeneity
   of the two factors in the fundamental dualism of the Universe of
   intelligent beings. In a somewhat similar sense it is used in the
   Clementine Homilies xx. 7. The Platonic phrase for the Divine Nature,
   epekeina pases ousias, adopted by Origen and by Athanasius contra
   Gentes, appears to retain something of the idea of ousia as implying
   material existence; and this train of associations had to be expressly
   disclaimed in defending the Nicene formula. In the sense of homogeneity
   the word omoousion is expressly applied by Origen, as we have seen, to
   the Father and the Son: on the other hand, taking ousia in the primary'
   Aristotelian sense, he has heteros kat' ousian kai hupokeimenon In the
   West (see above on Tertullian and Novatian) the Latin substantia
   (Cicero had in vain attempted to give currency to the less euphonious
   but more suitable essentia) had taken its place in the phrase unius
   substantiÃ¦ orcommunio substantiÃ¦, intended to denote not only the
   homogeneity but the Unity of Father and Son. Accordingly we find
   Dionysius of Rome pressing the test upon his namesake of Alexandria and
   the latter not declining it (below, p. 183). But a few years later we
   find the Origenist bishops, who with the concurrence of Dionysius of
   Rome deposed Paul of Samosata, expressly repudiating the term. This
   fact, which is as certain as any fact in Church history (see Routh
   Rell. iii. 364 &c., Caspari Alte u. Neue. Q., pp. 161 sqq.), was a
   powerful support to the Arians in their subsequent endeavours to unite
   the conservative East in reaction against the council. Scholars are
   fairly equally divided as to the explanation of the fact. Some hold,
   following Athanasius and Basil, that Paul imputed the omoousion (in a
   materialising sense) to his opponents, as a consequence of the doctrine
   they opposed to his own, and that the 80' in repudiating the word,
   repudiated the idea that the divine nature could be divided by the
   emanation of a portion of it in the Logos. Hilary, on the other hand,
   tells us that the word was used by Paul himself (male omoousion Paulus
   confessus est, sed numquid melius Arii negaverunt?') If so, it must
   have been meant to deny the existence of the Logos as an ousia (i.e.
   Hypostasis) distinct from the Father. Unfortunately we have not the
   original documents to refer to. But in either case the word was
   repudiated at Antioch in one sense, enacted at NicÃ¦a in another. The
   fact however remains that the term does not exclude ambiguity.
   Athanasius is therefore going beyond strict accuracy when he claims (p.
   164) that no one who is not an Arian can fail to be in agreement with
   the Synod. Marcellus and Photinus alone prove the contrary. But he is
   right in regarding the word as rigidly excluding the heresy of Arius.

   This brings us to the question in what sense ousia is used in the
   Nicene definition. We must remember the strong Western and
   anti-Origenist influence which prevailed in the council (above, p.
   xvii.), and the use of hupostasis and ousia as convertible terms in the
   anathematism (see Excursus A, pp. 77, sqq. below). Now going back for a
   moment to the correspondence of the two Dionysii, we see that Dionysius
   of Rome had contended not so much against the subordination of the Son
   to the Father as against their undue separation (memerismenai
   hupostaseis). In other words he had pressed the homoousion upon his
   namesake in the interest rather of the unity than of the equality of
   the Persons in the Holy Trinity. At NicÃ¦a, the problem was (as shewn
   above) to explain (at least negatively) how the Church understood the
   Generation of the Son. Accordingly we find Athanasius in later years
   explaining that the Council meant to place beyond doubt the Essential
   Relation of the Divine Persons to one another (to idion tes ousias,
   tautotes, see de Decr. pp. 161, 163 sq., 165, 168, 319; of course
   including identity of Nature, pp. 396, 413, 232), and maintaining to
   the end (where he expresses his own view, p. 490, &c.) the
   convertibility of ousia and hupostasis for this purpose. By the word ho
   theos or theos he understands ouden heteron e ten ousian tou ontos (de
   Decr. 22). The conclusion is that in their original sense the
   definitions of NicÃ¦a assert not merely the specific identity of the Son
   with the Father (as Peter qua man is of one ousia with Paul, or the
   Emperor's statue of one form with the Emperor himself, p. 396), but the
   full unbroken continuation of the Being of the Father in the Son, the
   inseparable unity of the Son with the Father in the Oneness of the
   Godhead. Here the phrase is balanced' by the ek tes [hupostaseos e]
   ousias tou Patros, not as though merely one ousia had given existence
   to another, but in the sense that with such origination the ousia
   remained the same. This is a first approximation to the mysterious
   doctrine of the perichoresis' coinherence, or circuminsessio,' which is
   necessary to guard the doctrine of the Trinity against tritheism, but
   which, it must be observed, lifts it out of the reach of the categories
   of any system of thought in which the workings of human intelligence
   have ever been able to organise themselves. The doctrine of the Holy
   Trinity vindicated by the Nicene formula on the one hand remains, after
   the exclusion of others, as the one direction in which the Christian
   intellect can travel without frustrating and limiting the movement of
   faith, without bringing to a halt the instinct of faith in Christ as
   Saviour, implanted in the Church by the teaching of S. Paul and of S.
   John, of the Lord Himself: on the other hand it is not a full solution
   of the intellectual difficulties with which the analysis of that faith
   and those instincts brings us face to face. That God is One, and that
   the Son is God, are truths of revelation which the category of
   substance' fails to synthesise. The Nicene Definition furnishes a basis
   of agreement for the purpose of Christian devotion, worship, and life,
   but leaves two theologies face to face, with mutual recognition as the
   condition of the healthy life of either. The theology of Athanasius and
   of the West is that of the Nicene formula in its original sense. The
   inseparable Unity of the God of Revelation is its pivot. The conception
   of personality in the Godhead is its difficulty. The distinctness of
   the Father, Son, and Spirit is felt (allos ho Pater allos ho hui&
   231;s), but cannot be formulated so as to satisfy our full idea of
   personality. For this Athanasius had no word; prosopon meant too little
   (implying as it did no more than an aspect possibly worn but for a
   special period or purpose), hupostasis (implying such personality as
   separates Peter from Paul) too much. But he recognised the
   admissibility of the sense in which the Nicene formula eventually, in
   the theology of the Cappadocian fathers, won its way to supremacy in
   the East. To them hupostasis was an appropriate term to express the
   distinction of Persons in the Godhead, while ousia expressed the divine
   Nature which they possessed in common (see Excursus A. p. 77 sqq.).
   This sense of ousia approximated to that of species, or eidos
   (Aristotle's secondary' ousia), while that of hupostasis gravitated
   toward that of personality in the empirical sense. But in neither case
   did the approximation amount to complete identity. The idea of trine
   personality was limited by the consideration of the Unity; the
   perichoresis was recognised, although in a somewhat different form, the
   prominent idea in Athanasius being that of coinherence or immanence,
   whereas the Cappadocians, while using, of course, the language of John
   xiv. 11, yet prefer the metaphor of successive dependence hosper ex
   haluseo. (Bas. Ep. 38, p. 118 D). To Athanasius, the Godhead is
   complete not in the Father alone, still less in the Three Persons as
   parts of the one ousia, but in each Person as much as in all. The
   Cappadocian Fathers go back to the Origenist view that the Godhead is
   complete primarily in the Father alone, but mediately in the Son or
   Spirit, by virtue of their origination from the Father as pege or aitia
   tes theotetos. To Athanasius the distinct Personality of Son and Spirit
   was the difficulty; his difference from Origen was wide, from Marcellus
   subtle. To the Cappadocians the difficulty was the Unity of the
   Persons; to Marcellus they were toto cÃ¦lo opposed, they are the pupils
   of Origen [34] . Accordingly when Basil makes a distinction between
   ousia and hupostasis in the Nicene anathematism, he is giving not
   historical exegesis but his own opinion.

   The Nicene definition in this sense emphasized the Unity of the Godhead
   in Three Persons, against the Arian division of the Son from the
   Father. How then did it escape the danger of lending countenance to
   Monarchianism? Athanasius feels the difficulty without solving it, for
   the distinction given by him, p. 84, between homoousios and monoousios
   is without real meaning (we say with Tertullian of one substance'). On
   the whole in mature years he held that the title Son' was sufficient to
   secure the Trinity of Persons. By the name Father we confute Arius, by
   the name of Son we overthrow Sabellius' (p. 434; cf. p. 413); and we
   find that the council in its revision of the CÃ¦sarean creed shifted
   hui& 231;s to the principal position where it took the place of logos.
   Beyond this the Creed imposed no additional test in that direction (the
   ek tes ousias is important but not decisive in this respect). This was
   felt as an objection to the Creed, and the objection was pointed by the
   influence of Marcellus at the council. The historical position of
   Marcellus is in fact, as we shall see, the principal key to the
   conservative' reaction which followed. The insertion into the
   conservative creeds of a clause asserting the endlessness of Christ's
   Kingdom, which eventually received ecumenical authority, was an
   expression of this feeling. But a final explanation between the Nicene
   doctrine and Monarchianism could not come about until the idea of
   Personality had been tested in the light of the appearance of the Son
   in the Flesh. The solution, or rather definition, of the problem is to
   be sought in the history of the Christological questions which began
   with Apollinarius of Laodicea.

   The above account of the anti-Arian test formulated at NicÃ¦a will
   suffice to explain the motives for its adoption, the difficulties which
   made that adoption reluctant, and the fact of the reaction which
   followed. One thing is clear, namely that given the actual conditions,
   nothing short of the test adopted would have availed to exclude the
   Arian doctrine. It is also I think clear, that not only was the current
   theology of the Eastern Church unable to cope with Arianism, but that
   it was itself a danger to the Church and in need of the corrective
   check of the Nicene definition. Hellenic as was the system of Origen,
   it was in its spirit Christian, and saturated with the influence of
   Scripture. It could never have taken its place as the expression of the
   whole mind of the Church; but it remains as the noblest monument of a
   Christian intellect resolutely in love with truth for its own sake, and
   bent upon claiming for Christ the whole range of the legitimate
   activity of the human spirit. But the age had inherited only the wreck
   of Origenism, and its partial victory in the Church had brought
   confusion in its train, the leaders of the Church were characterised by
   secular knowledge rather than grasp of first principles, by dogmatic
   intellectualism rather than central apprehension of God in Christ.
   Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea is their typical representative. The Nicene
   definition and the work of Athanasius which followed were a summons
   back to the simple first principles of the Gospel and the Rule of
   Faith. What then is their value to ourselves? Above all, this, that
   they have preserved to us what Arianism would have destroyed, that
   assurance of Knowledge of, and Reconciliation to, God in Christ of
   which the divinity of the Saviour is the indispensable condition; if we
   are now Christians in the sense of S. Paul we owe it under God to the
   work of the great synod. Not that the synod explained all; or did more
   than effectually block off false forms of thought or avenues of
   unbalanced inference' which challenged the acceptance of Christian
   people.' The decisions of councils are primarily not the Church saying
   "yes" to fresh truths or developments or forms of consciousness; but
   rather saying "no" to untrue and misleading modes of shaping and
   stating her truth,' (Lux Mundi, ed. i. p. 240, cf. p. 334). It is
   objected that the Nicene Formula, especially as understood by
   Athanasius, is itself a false form of thought,' a flat contradiction in
   terms. That the latter is true we do not dispute (see Newman's notes
   infra, p. 336, note 1, &c.). But before pronouncing the form of thought
   for that reason a false one, we must consider what the terms' are, and
   to what they are applied. To myself it appears that a religion which
   brought the divine existence into the compass of the categories of any
   philosophy would by that very fact forfeit its claim to the character
   of revelation. The categories of human thought are the outcome of
   organised experience of a sensible world, and beyond the limits of that
   world they fail us. This is true quite apart from revelation. The ideas
   of essence and substance, personality and will, separateness and
   continuity, cause and effect, unity and plurality, are all in different
   degrees helps which the mind uses in order to arrange its knowledge,
   and valid within the range of experience, but which become a danger
   when invested with absolute validity as things in themselves. Even the
   mathematician reaches real results by operating with terms which
   contain a perfect contradiction (e.g. Â·, and to some extent the
   calculus of operations'). The idea of Will in man, of Personality in
   God, present difficulties which reason cannot reconcile.

   The revelation of Christ is addressed primarily to the will not to the
   intellect, its appeal is to Faith not to Theology. Theology is the
   endeavour of the Christian intellect to frame for itself conceptions of
   matters belonging to the immediate consequences of our faith, matters
   about which we must believe something, but as to which the Lord and His
   Apostles have delivered nothing formally explicit. Theology has no
   doubt its certainties beyond the express teaching of our Lord and the
   New Testament writers; but its work is subject to more than the usual
   limitations of human thought: we deal with things outside the range of
   experience, with celestial things; but we have no celestial language.'
   To abandon all theology would be to acquiesce in a dumb faith: we are
   to teach, to explain, to defend; the logos sophias and logos gnoseos
   have from the first been gifts of the Spirit for the building up of the
   Body. But we know in part and prophesy in part, and our terms begin to
   fail us just in the region where the problem of guarding the faith of
   the simple ends and the inevitable metaphysic, into which all pure
   reflexion merges, begins. Eite oun philosopheteon eite me
   philosopheteon, philosopheteon, man is metaphysical nolens volens:'
   only let us recollect that when we find ourselves in the region of
   antinomies we are crossing the frontier line between revelation and
   speculation, between the domain of theology and that of ontology. That
   this line is approached in the definition of the great council no one
   will deny. But it was reached by the council and by the subsequent
   consent of the Church reluctantly and under compulsion. The bold
   assumption that we can argue from the revelation of God in Christ to
   mysteries beyond our experience was made by the Gnostics, by Arius: the
   Church met them by a denial of what struck at the root of her belief,
   not by the claim to erect formulÃ¦ applied merely for the lack of better
   into a revealed ontology. In the terms Person, Hypostasis, Will,
   Essence, Nature, Generation, Procession, we have the embodiment of
   ideas extracted from experience, and, as applied to God, representing
   merely the best attempt we can make to explain what we mean when we
   speak of God as Father and of Christ as His Son. Even these last sacred
   names convey their full meaning to us only in view of the historical
   person of Christ and of our relation to God through Him. That this
   meaning is based upon an absolute relation of Christ to the Father is
   the rock of our faith. That relation is mirrored in the name Son of
   God: but what it is in itself, when the empirical connotations of
   Sonship are stripped away, we cannot possibly know. Omoousios to Patri,
   ek tes ousias tou Patros' these words assert at once our faith that
   such relation exists and our ignorance of its nature. To the simplicity
   of faith it is enough to know (and this knowledge is what our formula
   secures) that in Christ we have not only the perfect Example of Human
   Love to God, but the direct expression and assurance of the Father's
   Love to us.

   (c) Materials for Reaction.

   The victory of NicÃ¦a was rather a surprise than a solid conquest. As it
   was not the spontaneous and deliberate purpose of the bishops present,
   but a revolution which a minority had forced through by sheer strength
   of clearer Christian thought, a reaction was inevitable as soon as the
   half-convinced conservatives returned home' (Gwatkin). The reaction,
   however, was not for a long time overtly doctrinal. The defeat, the
   moral humiliation of Arianism at the council was too signal, the
   prestige of the council itself too overpowering, the Emperor too
   resolute in supporting its definition, to permit of this. Not till
   after the death of Constantine in 337 does the policy become manifest
   of raising alternative symbols to a coordinate rank with that of NicÃ¦a;
   not till six years after the establishment of Constantius as sole
   Emperor,--i.e. not till 357,--did Arianism once again set its mouth to
   the trumpet. During the reign of Constantine the reaction, though
   doctrinal in its motive, was personal in its ostensible grounds. The
   leaders of the victorious minority at NicÃ¦a are one by one attacked on
   this or that pretence and removed from their Sees, till at the time of
   Constantine's death the East is in the hands of their opponents. What
   were the forces at work which made this possible?

   (1) Persecuted Arians. Foremost of all, the harsh measures adopted by
   Constantine with at least the tacit approval of the Nicene leaders
   furnished material for reaction. Arius and his principal friends were
   sent into exile, and as we have seen they went in bitterness of spirit.
   Arius himself was banished to Illyricum, and would seem to have
   remained there five or six years. (The chronology of his recall is
   obscure, but see D.C.B. ii. 364, and Gwatkin, p. 86, note 2). It would
   be antecedently very unlikely that a religious exile would spare
   exertions to gain sympathy for himself and converts to his opinions. As
   a matter of fact, Arianism had no more active supporters during the
   next half-century than two bishops of the neighbouring province of
   Pannonia, Valens of Mursa (Mitrowitz), and Ursacius [35] of Singidunum
   (Belgrade). Valens and Ursacius are described as pupils of Arius, and
   there is every reason to trace their personal relations with the
   heresiarch to his Illyrian exile. The seeds sown in Illyria at this
   time were still bearing fruit nearly 50 years later (pp. 489, 494,
   note). Secundus nursed his bitterness fully thirty years (p. 294; cf.
   456). Theognis grasped at revenge at Tyre in 335 (pp. 104, 114).
   Eusebius of Nicomedia, recalled from exile with his friend and
   neighbour Theognis, not long after the election of Athanasius in 328,
   was ready to move heaven and earth to efface the results of the
   council. The harsh measures against the Arians then, if insufficient to
   account for the reaction, at any rate furnished it with the energy of
   personal bitterness and sense of wrong.

   (2) The Eusebians and the Court. Until the council of Sardica (i.e. a
   short time after the death of Eusebius of Nicomedia), the motive power
   of the reaction proceeded from the environment of Eusebius, hoi peri
   Eusebion. It should be observed once for all that the term Eusebians'
   is the later and inexact equivalent of the last named Greek phrase,
   which (excepting perhaps p. 436) has reference to Eusebius of Nicomedia
   only, and not to his namesake of CÃ¦sarea. The latter, no doubt, lent
   his support to the action of the party, but ought not to suffer in our
   estimation from the misfortune of his name. Again, the Eusebians' are
   not a heresy, nor a theological party or school; they are the ring,' or
   personal entourage, of one man, a master of intrigue, who succeeded in
   combining a very large number of men of very different opinions in more
   or less close association for common ecclesiastical action. The
   Eusebians' sensu latiori are the majority of Asiatic bishops who were
   in reaction against the council and its leaders; in the stricter sense
   the term denotes the pure Arians like Eusebius, Theognis, and the rest,
   and those political Arians' who without settled adherence to Arian
   principles, were, for all practical purposes, hand in glove with
   Eusebius and his fellows. To the former class emphatically belong
   Valens and Ursacius, whose recantation in 347 is the solitary and
   insufficient foundation for the sweeping generalisation of Socrates
   (ii. 37), that they always inclined to the party in power,' and George,
   the presbyter of Alexandria, afterwards bishop of the Syrian Laodicea,
   who, although he went through a phase of conservatism,' 357-359, began
   and ended (Gwatkin, pp. 181-183) as an Arian, pure and simple. Among
   political Arians' of this period Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea is the chief. He
   was not, as we have said above, an Arian theologically, yet whatever
   allowances may be made for his conduct during this period (D.C.B., ii.
   315, 316) it tended all in one direction. But on the whole, political
   Arianism is more abundantly exemplified in the Homoeans of the next
   generation, whose activity begins about the time of the death of
   Constans. The Eusebians proper were political indeed ei tines kai
   alloi, but their essential Arianism is the one element of principle
   about them [36] . Above all, the employment of the term Semi-Arians' as
   a synonym for Eusebians, or indeed as a designation of any party at
   this period, is to be strongly deprecated. It is the (possibly somewhat
   misleading, but reasonable and accepted) term for the younger
   generation of convinced conservatives,' whom we find in the sixth
   decade of the century becoming conscious of their essential difference
   in principle from the Arians, whether political or pure, and feeling
   their way toward fusion with the Nicenes. These are a definite party,
   with a definite theological position, to which nothing in the earlier
   period exactly corresponds. The Eusebians proper were not semi-, but
   real Arians. Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea and the Asiatic conservatives are the
   predecessors of the semi-Arians, but their position is not quite the
   same. Reserving them for a moment, we must complete our account of the
   Eusebians proper. Their nucleus consisted of the able and influential
   circle of Lucianists;' it has been remarked by an unprejudiced observer
   that, so far as we know, not one of them was eminent as a religious
   character (Harnack, ii. 185); their strength was in fixity of policy
   and in ecclesiastical intrigue; and their battery was the imperial
   court. Within three years of the Council, Constantine had begun to
   waver, not in his resolution to maintain the Nicene Creed, that he
   never relaxed, but in his sternness toward its known opponents. His
   policy was dictated by the desire for unity: he was made to feel the
   lurking dissatisfaction of the bishops of Asia, perhaps as his anger
   was softened by time he missed the ability and ready counsel of the
   extruded bishop of his residential city. An Arian presbyter
   (Eustathius' or Eutokius'?), who was a kind of chaplain to Constantia,
   sister of Constantine and widow of Licinius, is said to have kept the
   subject before the Emperor's mind after her death (in 328, see Socr. i.
   25). At last, as we have seen, first Eusebius and Theognis were
   recalled, then Arius himself was pardoned upon his general assurance of
   agreement with the faith of the Synod.

   The atmosphere of a court is seldom favourable to a high standard of
   moral or religious principle; and the place-hunters and hangers-on of
   the imperial courts of these days were an exceptionally worthless crew
   (see Gwatkin, p. 60, 100, 234). It is a tribute to the Nicene cause
   that their influence was steadily on the other side, and to the
   character of Constantine that he was able throughout the greater part
   of the period to resist it, at any rate as far as Athanasius was
   concerned. But on the whole the court was the centre whence the webs of
   Eusebian intrigue extended to Egypt, Antioch, and many other obscurer
   centres of attack.

   The influences outside the Church were less directly operative in the
   campaign, but such as they were they served the Eusebian plans. The
   expulsion of a powerful bishop from the midst of a loyal flock was
   greatly assisted by the co-operation of a friendly mob; and Jews (pp.
   94, 296), and heathen alike were willing to aid the Arian cause. The
   army, the civil service, education, the life of society were still
   largely heathen; the inevitable influx of heathen into the Church, now
   that the empire had become Christian, brought with it multitudes to
   whom Arianism was a more intelligible creed than that of NicÃ¦a; the
   influence of the philosophers was a serious factor, they might well
   welcome Arianism as a Selbstersetzung des Christentums.' This is not
   inconsistent with the instances of persecution of heathenism by Arian
   bishops, and of savage heathen reprisals, associated with the names of
   George of Alexandria, Patrophilus, Mark of Arethusa, and others. (For a
   fuller discussion, with references, see Gwatkin, pp. 53-59.)

   (3.) The Ecclesiastical Conservatives. Something has already been said
   in more than one connection to explain how it came to pass that the
   very provinces whose bishops made up the large numerical majority at
   NicÃ¦a, also furnished the numbers which swelled the ranks of the
   Eusebians at Tyre, Antioch, and Philippopolis. The actual men were, of
   course, in many cases [37] changed in the course of years, but the sees
   were the same, and there is ample evidence that the staunch Nicene
   party were in a hopeless minority in Asia Minor [38] and but little
   stronger in Syria. The indefiniteness of this mass of episcopal opinion
   justifies the title Conservative.' In adopting it freely, we must not
   forget, what the whole foregoing account has gone to shew, that their
   conservatism was of the empirical or short-sighted kind, prone to
   acquiesce in things as they are, hard to arouse to a sense of a great
   crisis, reluctant to step out of its groove. If by conservatism we mean
   action which really tends to preserve the vital strength of an
   institution, then Athanasius and the leaders of NicÃ¦a were the only
   conservatives. But it is not an unknown thing for vulgar conservatism
   to take alarm at the clear grasp of principles and facts which alone
   can carry the State over a great crisis, and by wrapping itself up in
   its prejudices to play into the hands of anarchy. Common men do not
   easily rise to the level of mighty issues. Where Demosthenes saw the
   crisis of his nation's destiny, Ã†schines saw materials for a personal
   impeachment of his rival. In the anti-Nicene reaction the want of
   clearness of thought coincided with the fatal readiness to magnify
   personal issues. Here was the opportunity of the Arian leaders: a
   confused succession of personal skirmishes, in which the mass of men
   saw no religious principle, nor any combined purpose (Soc. i. 13,
   nuktomachias te ouden apeiche ta ginomena) was conducted from
   headquarters with a fixed steady aim. But their machinations would have
   been fruitless had the mass of the bishops been really in sympathy with
   the council to which they were still by their own action committed.
   Arian hatred of the council would have been powerless if it had not
   rested on a formidable mass of conservative discontent: while the
   conservative discontent might have died away if the court had not
   supplied it with the means of action' (Gwatkin, p. 61. He explains the
   policy of the court by the religious sympathies of Asia Minor [39] and
   its political importance, pp. 90-91.) But the authority of the council
   remained unchallenged during the lifetime of Constantine, and no Arian
   raised his voice against it. One doctrinal controversy there was, of
   subordinate importance, but of a kind to rivet the conservatives to
   their attitude of sullen reaction.

   It follows from what has been said of the influence of Origen in
   moulding the current theology of the Eastern Church, that the one
   theological principle which was most vividly and generally grasped was
   the horror of Monarchian and especially of Sabellian' teaching. Now in
   replying to Asterius the spokesman of early Arianism, no less a person
   than Marcellus, bishop of Ancyra (Angora) in Galatia, and one of the
   principal leaders of NicÃ¦a, had laid himself open to this charge. It
   was brought with zeal and learning (in 336) in two successive works by
   Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea, which, with Ath., Orat. iv. are our principal
   source of information as to the tenets of Marcellus (see D.C.B. ii.
   341, sq., Zahn Marcellus 99 sqq., fragments collected by Rettberg
   Marcelliana). On the other hand he was uniformly supported by the
   Nicene party, and especially by Athanasius and the Roman Church. His
   book was examined at Sardica, and on somewhat ex parte grounds (p. 125)
   pronounced innocent: a personal estrangement from Athanasius shortly
   after (Hilar. Fragm. ii. 21, 23) on account of certain ambiguÃ¦
   prÃ¦dicationes eius, in quam Photinus erupit, doctrinÃ¦,' did not amount
   to a formal breach of communion (he is mentioned 14 years later as an
   exiled Nicene bishop, pp. 256, 271), nor did the anxious questioning of
   Epiphanius (see HÃ¦r. 72. 4.) succeed in extracting from the then aged
   Athanasius more than a significant smile. He refuses to condemn him,
   and in arguing against opinions which appear to be his, he refrains
   from mentioning the name even of Photinus [40] . It may be well
   therefore to sketch in a few touches what we know of the system of
   Marcellus, in order that we may appreciate the relative right of
   Eusebius in attacking, and of Athanasius and the Romans in supporting
   him. Marcellus is a representative of the traditional theology of Asia
   Minor, as we find it in Ignatius and IrenÃ¦us (see above, pp.
   xxii.-xxiv., xxvi. fin.), and is independent of any influence of, or
   rather in conscious reaction against, Origenism. We cannot prove that
   he had studied either Ignatius or IrenÃ¦us, but we find the doctrine of
   anakephalaiosis with reference to Creation and the Incarnation, and the
   Ignatian thought of the Divine Silence, and a general unmistakeable
   affinity (cf. Zahn 236-244). Marcellus appeals from Origen to S. John.'
   He begins with the idea of Sonship, as Arius and the Nicene Council had
   done. Perceiving that on the one hand Arians and Origenists alike were
   led by the idea of Sonship as dependent on paternal will to infer the
   inferiority of the Son to the Father, and in the more extreme case to
   deny His coeternity, feeling on the other hand (with IrenÃ¦us II.
   xxviii. 6) our inability to find an idea to correspond with the
   relation implied in the eternal Sonship, he turns to the first chapter
   of S. John as the classic passage for the pre-existent nature of
   Christ. He finds that before the Incarnation the Saviour is spoken of
   as Logos only: accordingly all other designations, even that of Son,
   must be reserved for the Incarnate. Moreover (Joh. i. 1) the Word is
   strictly coeternal, and no name implying an act (such as gennesis) can
   express the relation of the Word to God. But in view of the Divine
   Purpose of Creation and Redemption (for the latter is involved in the
   former by the doctrine of anakephalaiosis) there is a process, a
   stirring within the divine Monad. The Word which is potentially
   (dunamei) eternally latent in God proceeds forth in Actuality (energei&
   139;), yet without ceasing to be potentially in God as well. In this
   energeia drastike, to which the word gennesis may be applied, begins
   the great drama of the Universe which rises to the height of the
   Incarnation, and which, after the Economy is completed, and fallen man
   restored (and more than restored) to the Sonship of God which he had
   lost, ends in the return of the Logos to the Father, the handing over
   of His Kingdom by the Son, that God may be all in all.

   What strikes one throughout the scheme is the intense difficulty caused
   to Marcellus by the unsolved problem which underlies the whole theology
   of the Nicene leaders, the problem of personality. The Manhood of
   Christ was to Marcellus per se non-personal. The seat of its
   personality was the indwelling Logos. But in what sense was the Logos
   itself personal? Here Marcellus loses his footing: in what sense can
   any idea of personality attach to a merely potential existence? Again,
   if it was only in the energeia drastike that the personality of the
   Word was realised, and this only reached its fulness in the Incarnation
   of Christ, was the transition difficult to the plain assertion that the
   personality of the Son, or of the Word, originated with the
   Incarnation? But if this were not so, and if the Person of the Word was
   to recede at the consummation of all things into the Unity of the
   Godhead, what was to become of the Nature He had assumed? That it too
   could merge into a potential existence within the Godhead was of course
   impossible; what then was its destiny? The answer of Marcellus was
   simple: he did not know (Zahn, 179); for Scripture taught nothing
   beyond 1 Cor. xv. 28.

   We now perceive the subtle difference between Marcellus and Athanasius.
   Neither of them could formulate the idea of Personality in the Holy
   Trinity. But Athanasius, apparently on the basis of a more thorough
   intelligence of Scripture (for Marcellus, though a devout, was a
   partial and somewhat ignorant biblical theologian), felt what Marcellus
   did not, the steady inherent personal distinctness of the Father and
   the Son. Accordingly, while Athanasius laid down and adhered to the
   doctrine of eternal gennesis, Marcellus involved himself in the
   mystical and confused idea of a divine platusmos and sustole. Moreover,
   while Athanasius was clearsighted in his apprehension of the problem of
   the day, Marcellus was after all merely conservative: he went behind
   the conservatism of the Origenists,--behind even that of the West,
   where Tertullian had left a sharper sense of personal distinction in
   the Godhead,--to an archaic conservatism akin to the naive modalism' of
   the early Church; upon this he engrafted reflexion, in part that of the
   old Asiatic theology, in part his own. As the result, his faith was
   such as Athanasius could not but recognise as sincere; but in his
   attempt to give it theological expression he split upon the rocks of
   Personality, of Eschatology, of the divine immutability. His theology
   was an honest and interesting but mistaken attempt to grapple with a
   problem before he understood another which lay at its base. In doing so
   he exposed himself justly to attack; but we may with Athanasius, while
   acknowledging this, retain a kindly sympathy for this veteran ally of
   many confessors and sturdy opponent of the alliance between science and
   theology.

   The feeling against Marcellus might have been less strong, at any rate
   it would have had less show of reason, but for the fact that he was the
   teacher of Photinus. This person became bishop of Sirmium between 330
   and 340, gave great offence by his teaching, and was deposed by the
   Arian party ineffectually in 347, finally in 351. After his expulsion
   he occupied himself with writing books in Greek and in Latin, including
   a work against all heresies,' in which he expounded his own (Socr. ii.
   30). None of his works have survived, and our information is very
   scanty (Zahn, Marc. 189-196 is the best account), but he seems to have
   solved the central difficulty of Marcellus by placing the seat of the
   Personality of Christ in His Human Soul. How much of the system of his
   master he retained is uncertain, but the result was in substance pure
   Unitarianism. It is instructive to observe that even Photinus was
   passively supported for a time by the Nicenes. He was apparently (Hil.
   Fr. ii. 19, sqq.) condemned at a council at Milan in 345, but not at
   Rome till 380. Athanasius (pp. 444-447) abstains from mentioning his
   name although he refutes his opinions; once only he mentions him as a
   heretic, and with apparent reluctance (c. Apoll. ii. 19, tou legomenou
   photeinou). The first [41] condemnation of him on the Nicene side in
   the East is by Paulinus of Antioch in 362 (p. 486). On the other hand
   the Eusebians eagerly caught at so irresistible a weapon. Again and
   again they hurled anathemas at Photinus, at first simply identifying
   him with Marcellus, but afterwards with full appreciation of his
   position. And even to the last the new Nicene party in Asia were
   aggrieved at the refusal of the old Nicenes at Alexandria and Rome to
   anathematise the master of such a heretic. Photinus was the scandal of
   Marcellus, Marcellus of the Council of NicÃ¦a.

   doubtless meant by Eusebius in an Origenist sense.

   [23] The theological genesis of Paul's system is obscure. The theory of
   Newman that he was under strong Jewish influences is largely based upon
   the late and apparently quite erroneous tradition that his patroness
   Zenobia was a Jewess; see p. 296, note 9^a, and Gwatkin, p. 57, and
   note 3. Harnack regards him as the representative of archaic'
   East-Syrian adoptionism such as pervades the Discussion of Archelaus
   with Manes;' see Routh, Rell. v. especially pp. 178-184. But Paul would
   not have spoken of Mary as Dei Genetrix,' p. 128; I cannot see more in
   these Acta' than a naive adoptionism homologous to the naive modalism'
   of much early Christian language, but like it not representative of the
   entire view of those who use it; we must also note that the statements
   of Archelaus' are coloured by reaction against the docetism of Manes;'
   but Paul may well have taken up this naive adoptionism, and, by strict
   Aristotelian logic, developed it as the exclusive basis of his system.
   Whether Paul's use of the idea of the Logos betrays the faintest
   influence of Origen is to me, at least, extremely uncertain.

   [24] aposunagogos emeinen, Alex. Alexand. in Thdt.; the objections of
   Gwatkin, p. 18, note, are generously meant rather than convincing: the
   creed of Lucian' is not usable without discrimination for Lucian's
   position: see discussion by Caspari A.u.N.Q. p. 42, note.

   [25] . 598, ii. 183 sqq. must, I think, convince any open mind of the
   fact. Consult his article on Lucian in Herzog^2. viii. 767 (the best
   investigation), also Neander H. E. ii. 198, iv. 108; MÃ¶ller K.G. i.
   226, D.C.B. iii. 748; KÃ¶lling, vol. 1, pp. 27-31, who makes the mistake
   of taking the Lucianic creed' as his point of departure.

   [26] This is ascribed to Lucian by Epiph. Ancor. 33, and there is no
   reason whatever to doubt it. The tenet was part of the Arian system
   from the first, and was attacked already by Eustathius, Fragm. apud
   Thdt. Dial. iii., but often overlooked, e.g. even by Athanasius in his
   writings before 362, but see p. 352, note 5. It came to the front in
   the system of Eunomius, and was much discussed in the last decade of
   the life of S. Athan. The system of Apollinaris was different. (See pp.
   570, note 1, 575, note 1.)

   [27] aparallakton eikona, which an Arian would be prepared to admit as
   the result of the prokope. (See below, Â§6, on the Creeds of 341). I
   cannot regard Asterius as a semi-Arian;' the only grounds for it are
   the above phrase and the statement (Lib. Syn.) that he attended the
   Council of 341 with the Conservative Dianius. But Asterius was as ready
   to compromise with conservatism as he had formerly been with
   heathenism, and his anxiety for a bishopric would carry him to even
   greater lengths in order to attend a council under influential
   patronage.

   [28] The letter of Alexander to his namesake of Byzantium in Thdt. i.
   4, cannot be exempted from this generalisation.

   [29] They appear to have comprised the Arian appeal to Scripture of
   which (considering the Biblical learning of Lucian and what we hear of
   the training of Aetius, to say nothing of the exegetical chair held by
   Arius at Alxa.) their use must be pronounced meagre and superficial. In
   the O.T. they harped upon three texts, Deut. vi. 4 (Monotheism), Ps.
   xlv. 8 (Adoptionism), and Prov. viii. 22, LXX. (the Word a Creature).
   In the N.T. they appeal for Monotheism (in their sense) to Luke xviii.
   19, John xvii. 3; The Son a Creature, Acts ii. 36, 1 Cor. i. 24, Col.
   i. 15, Heb. iii. 2; Adoptionism, Matt. xii. 28; prokope, Luke ii. 52;
   also Matt. xxvi. 41, Phil. ii. 6, sq., Heb. i. 4; The Son treptos, &c.,
   Mark xiii. 32, John xiii. 31, xi. 34; inferior to the Father, John xiv.
   48, Matt. xxvii. 46, also xi. 27 a, xxvi. 39, xxviii. 18, John xii. 27,
   and 1 Cor. xv. 28 (cf. pp. 407, sq.). In this respect Origen is
   immeasurably superior.

   [30] They are regarded by Athan., a generation after they were written,
   as the representative statement of the case' for Arianism (pp. 459 sq.;
   324 sqq., 361, 363, 368, &c., from which passages and Eus. c. Marcell.
   a fragmentary restoration might be attempted). For what is known of his
   history (not in D.C.B.) see Gwatkin, p. 72, note; for his doctrinal
   position see above, p. xxviii.

   [31] A theology which aims at consistency must borrow a method, a
   philosophy, from outside the sphere of religion. The most developed
   system of Catholic theology, that of S. Thomas Aquinas, borrows its
   method from the same source as did Arius,--Aristotle.

   [32] This illustrates the famous paradox of Cardinal Newman
   (Development, ed. 1878, pp. 142-4), that the condemnation of Arian
   Christology left vacant a throne in heaven which the medieval Church
   legitimately filled with the Blessed Virgin; that the Nicene
   condemnation of the Arian theology is the vindication of the medieval;
   that the votaries of Mary do not exceed the true faith, unless the
   blasphemers of her Son come up to it.' But the question here was one of
   worship, not of theology. The Arians worshipped Christ, whom they
   regarded as a created being: therefore, the Nicene fathers urge with
   one consent, they were idolaters. The idea of a created being capable
   of being worshipped was an Arian legacy to the Church, no doubt. But
   this very idea, to Athanasius and Hilary, marked them out as idolaters.
   It was reserved for later times to find a subject for an Arian
   predicate' (Mozley). The argument is an astonishing admission.

   and less technical, but see the brief account in Liddell and Scott.

   [34] Gregory Thaumaturgus was the great Origenist influence in northern
   Asia Minor: the Cappadocian fathers were also influenced in the
   direction of the homoousion by Apollinarius: see the correspondence
   between Basil and the latter, Bas. Epp. 8, 9, edited by DrÃ¤seke in
   Ztschr. fÃ¼r K.G. viii. 85 sqq. Apollinarius was of course equally
   opposed to Arianism and to Origen: see also p. 449 sq.

   [35] They were probably not yet bishops at this time, as they were
   young bishops at Tyre in 335; evidently they are the fairest of God's
   youthful flock' (!) alluded to in Eus. V. C. iv. 43.

   [36] At the same time Arius himself and all his fellow Lucianists
   (unlike the obscure Secundus and Theonas, and the later generation of
   Eunomians) are open to the charge of subserviency at a pinch.

   [37] Alexander of Thessalonica had been at NicÃ¦a, Dianius of CÃ¦s. Capp.
   had not. The two are typical of the better sort of conservatives.

   [38] For Asia besides Marcellus we have only Diodorus of Tenedos, not
   at NicÃ¦a, but expelled soon after 330, p. 271; signs at Sardica, p.
   147, banished again p. 276, not in D.C.B.; for Syria the names p. 271,
   cf. p. 256.

   throne, see, on Justinian, D.C.B. iii. 545a, sub fin. Newman, Arians,
   Appendix v., brings no conclusive proof of strong Nicene feeling among
   the masses of the laity in this region. But the people' in Galatia,
   according to Basil, remained devoted to Marcellus.

   [40] At the same time he adopts a certain reserve in speaking of
   Marcellus, and his name is absent from the roll of the orthodox, p.
   227.

   [41] But he is condemned by name in the alleged Coptic Acts of the
   Council of 362; moreover Eustathius appears to have written against
   him, see Cowper, Syr. Misc. 60.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§4. Early years of his Episcopate. The Anti-Nicene reaction, 328-335.

   Athanasius was elected bishop by general consent. Alexander, as we have
   seen, had practically nominated him, and a large body of popular
   opinion clamoured for his election, as "the good, the pious, a
   Christian, one of the ascetics, a genuine bishop." The actual election
   appears (p. 103) to have rested with the bishops of Egypt and Libya,
   who testify ten years later (ib.) that the majority [42] of their body
   elected him.

   The see to which he succeeded was the second in Christendom; it had
   long enjoyed direct jurisdiction over the bishops of all Egypt and
   Libya (p. 178, Socr. i. 9), the bishops of Alexandria enjoyed the
   position and power of secular potentates, although in a less degree
   than those of Rome, or of Alexandria itself in later times (Socr. vii.
   11, cf. 7). The bishop had command of large funds, which, however, were
   fully claimed for church purposes and alms (see p. 105). In particular,
   the pope' of Alexandria had practically in his hands the appointment to
   the sees in his province: accordingly, as years go on, we find Arianism
   disappear entirely from the Egyptian episcopate. The bishop of
   Alexandria, like many other influential bishops in antiquity, was
   commonly spoken of as Papa or Pope; he also was known as the
   'Archiepiskopos, as we learn from a contemporary inscription (see p.
   564, note 2).

   The earliest biographer of Athanasius (see Introduction to Hist. Aceph.
   p. 495, 496, below) divides the episcopate of Athanasius into periods
   of quiet' and of exile, marking the periods of each according to what
   appears to be the reckoning officially preserved in the episcopal
   archives. His first period of quiet' lasts from June 8, 328, to July
   11, 335 (departure for Tyre), a period of seven years, one month and
   three days; it is thus the third longest period of undisturbed
   occupancy of his see, the next being the last from his final
   restoration under Valens till his death (seven years and three months),
   and the longest of all being the golden decade (346-356, really nine
   years and a quarter) preceding the Third Exile.

   Of the internal events of this first septennium of quiet we know little
   that is definite. At the end of it, however, we find him supported by
   the solid body of the Egyptian episcopate: and at the beginning one of
   his first steps (autumn of 329) was to make a visitation of the
   province to strengthen the churches of God' (Vit. Pach., cf. also
   Epiph. HÃ¦r. 68. 6). We learn from the life of Pachomius (on which see
   below, p. 189), that he penetrated as far as Syene on the Ethiopian
   frontier, and, as he passed Tabenne, was welcomed by Pachomius and his
   monks with great rejoicings. At the request of Saprion, bishop of
   Tentyra, in whose diocese the island was, he appears to have ordained
   Pachomius to the presbyterate, thus constituting his community a
   self-contained body (Acta SS. Mai. iii. 30, Appx.). The supposed
   consecration of Frumentius at this time must be reserved, in accordance
   with preponderating evidence, for Â§7.

   Meanwhile, the anti-Nicene reaction was being skilfully fostered by the
   strategy of Eusebius of Nicomedia. Within a year of the election of
   Athanasius we find him restored to imperial favour, and at once the
   assault upon the Nicene strongholds begins. The controversy between
   Marcellus and Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea (supra, p. xxxv.), appears to have
   begun later, but the latter was already, in conjunction with his friend
   Paulinus of Tyre and with Patrophilus, at theological war with
   Eustathius of Antioch. A synod of Arian and reactionary bishops
   assembled at Antioch, and deposed the latter on the two charges
   (equally de rigueur in such cases) of Sabellianism and immorality.
   Backed by a complaint (possibly founded on fact) that he had
   indiscreetly repeated a current tale (p. 271, n. 2) concerning Helena,
   the Emperor's mother, the sentence of the council had the full support
   of the civil arm, and Eustathius lost his see for ever. Although he
   lived till about 358, no council ventured to restore' him (discussed by
   Gwatkin, pp. 73, 74, note), but the Christian public of Antioch
   violently resented his extrusion, and a compact body of the
   Church-people steadily refused to recognise any other bishop during,
   and even after, his lifetime (infr. p. 481). Asclepas of Gaza was next
   disposed of, then Eutropius of Hadrianople, and many others (names, p.
   271). Meanwhile everything was done to foment disturbance in Egypt. The
   Meletians had been stirring ever since the death of Alexander, and
   Eusebius was not slow to use such an opportune lever. The object in
   view was two-fold, the restoration of Arius to communion in Alexandria,
   without which the moral triumph of the reaction would be unachieved,
   and the extrusion of Athanasius. Accordingly a fusion took place [43]
   between the Arians of Egypt and the Meletians, now under the leadership
   of John Arcaph,' whom Meletius on his death-bed had consecrated as his
   successor against the terms of the Nicene settlement. At any rate, the
   Meletians were attached to the cause by Eusebius by means of large
   promises. At the same time (330?) Eusebius, having obtained the recall
   of Arius from exile, wrote to Athanasius requesting him to admit Arius
   and his friends (Euzoius, Pistus, &c.) to communion; the bearer of the
   letter conveyed the assurance of dire consequences in the event of his
   non-compliance (p. 131). Athanasius refused to admit persons convicted
   of heresy at the Ecumenical Council. This brought a letter from the
   Emperor himself, threatening deposition by an imperial mandate unless
   he would freely admit all who should desire it;'--a somewhat sweeping
   demand. Athanasius replied firmly and, it would seem, with effect, that
   the Christ-opposing heresy had no fellowship with the Catholic Church.'
   Thereupon Eusebius played what proved to be the first card of a long
   suit. A deputation of three Meletian bishops arrived at the Palace with
   a complaint. Athanasius had, they said, levied a precept (kanon) upon
   Egypt for Church expenses: they had been among the first victims of the
   exaction. Luckily, two Presbyters of Alexandria were at court, and were
   able to disprove the charge, which accordingly drew a stern rebuke upon
   its authors. Constantine wrote to Athanasius summoning him to an
   audience, probably with the intention of satisfying himself as to other
   miscellaneous accusations which were busily ventilated at this date,
   e.g., that he was too young (cf. p. 133) when elected bishop, that he
   had governed with arrogance and violence, that he used magic (this
   charge was again made 30 years later, Ammian. xv. 7), and subsidised
   treasonable persons. Athanasius accordingly started for court, as it
   would seem, late in 330 (see Letter 3, p. 512 sq.). His visit was
   successful, but matters went slowly; Athanasius himself had an illness,
   which lasted a long time, and upon his recovery the winter storms made
   communication impossible. Accordingly, his Easter letter for 332
   (Letter 4) was sent unusually late--apparently in the first navigable
   weather of that year--and Athanasius reached home, after more than a
   year's absence [44] , when Lent was already half over.

   The principal matters investigated by Constantine during the visit of
   Athanasius were certain charges made by the three Meletian bishops,
   whom Eusebius had detained for the purpose; one of these, the story of
   Macarius and the broken chalice, will be given at length presently. All
   alike were treated as frivolous, and Athanasius carried home with him a
   commendatory letter from Augustus himself. Defeated for the moment, the
   puppets of Eusebius matured their accusations, and in a year's time two
   highly damaging stories were ripe for an ecclesiastical investigation.

   (a) The case of Ischyras. This person had been ordained presbyter by
   Colluthus, and his ordination had been, as we have seen (Â§2),
   pronounced null and void by the Alexandrian Council of 324. In spite of
   this he had persisted in carrying on his ministrations at the village
   where he lived (Irene Secontaruri, possibly the hamlet Irene' belonged
   to the township of S., there was a presbyter for the township, pp. 133,
   145, but none at Irene, p. 106). His place of worship was a cottage
   inhabited only by an orphan child; of the few inhabitants of the place,
   only seven, and those his own relations, would attend his services.
   During a visitation of his diocese, Athanasius, had heard of this from
   the presbyter of the township, and had sent Macarius, one of the clergy
   who were attending him on his tour (cf. pp. 109, 139), to summon
   Ischyras for explanations. Macarius found the poor man ill in bed and
   unable to come, but urged his father to dissuade him from his irregular
   proceedings. But instead of desisting, Ischyras joined the Meletians.
   His first version of the matter appears to have been that Macarius had
   used violence, and broken his chalice. The Meletians communicate this
   to Eusebius, who eggs them on to get up the case. The story gradually
   improves. Ischyras, it now appeared, had been actually celebrating the
   Eucharist; Macarius had burst in upon him, and not only broken the
   chalice but upset the Holy Table. In this form the tale had been
   carried to Constantine when Athanasius was at Nicomedia. The relations
   of Ischyras, however, prevailed upon him to recall his statements, and
   he presented the Bishop with a written statement that the whole story
   was false, and had been extorted from him by violence. Ischyras was
   forgiven, but placed under censure, which probably led to his
   eventually renewing the charge with increased bitterness. Athanasius
   now was accused of personally breaking the chalice, &c. In the letter
   of the council of Philippopolis the cottage of Ischyras becomes a
   basilica' which Athanasius had caused to be thrown down.

   (b) The case of Arsenius. Arsenius was Meletian bishop of Hypsele (not
   in the Meletian catalogue of 327). By a large bribe, as it is stated,
   he was induced by John Arcaph to go into hiding among the Meletian
   monks of the Thebaid; rumours were quietly set in motion that
   Athanasius had had him murdered, and had procured one of his hands for
   magical purposes. A hand was circulated purporting to be the very hand
   in question. A report of the case, including the last version of the
   Ischyras scandal, was sent to Constantine, who, startled by the new
   accusation, sent orders to his half-brother, Dalmatius, a high official
   at Antioch, to enquire into the case. He appears to have suggested a
   council at CÃ¦sarea under the presidency of Eusebius, which was to meet
   at some time in the year 334 (perusin, p. 141, cf. note 2 there, also
   Gwatkin, p. 84 note; the 30 months' of Soz. ii. 25 is an exaggeration).
   Athanasius, however, obstinately declined a trial before a judge whom
   he regarded as biassed; his refusal bitterly offended the aged
   historian. Accordingly the venue was fixed for Tyre in the succeeding
   year; a Count Dionysius was to represent the Emperor, and see that all
   was conducted fairly, and Athanasius was stringently (p. 137) summoned
   to attend. Meanwhile a trusted deacon was on the tracks of the missing
   man. Arsenius was traced to a monastery' of Meletian brethren in the
   nome of AntÃ¦opolis in Upper Egypt. Pinnes, the presbyter of the
   community, got wind of the discovery, and smuggled Arsenius away down
   the Nile; presently he was spirited away to Tyre. The deacon, however,
   very astutely made a sudden descent upon the monastery in force, seized
   Pinnes, carried him to Alexandria, brought him before the Duke,'
   confronted him with the monk who had escorted Arsenius away, and forced
   them to confess to the whole plot. As soon as he was able to do so,
   Pinnes wrote to John Arcaph, warning him of the exposure, and
   suggesting that the charge had better be dropped (p. 135; the letter is
   an amusingly naive exhibition of human rascality). Meanwhile (Socr. i.
   29) Arsenius was heard of at an inn in Tyre by the servant of a
   magistrate; the latter had him arrested, and informed Athanasius [45] .
   Arsenius stoutly denied his identity, but was recognised by the bishop
   of Tyre, and at last confessed. The Emperor was informed and wrote to
   Athanasius (p. 135), expressing his indignation at the plot, as also
   did Alexander, bishop of Thessalonica. Arsenius made his peace with
   Athanasius, and in due time succeeded (according to the Nicene rule) to
   the sole episcopate of Hypsele (p. 548). John Arcaph even admitted his
   guilt and renounced his schisms and was invited to Court (p. 136); but
   his submission was not permanent.

   According to the Apology of Athanasius, all this took place some time
   before the council of Tyre; we cannot fix the date, except that it must
   have come after the Easter of 332 (see above). It appears most natural,
   from the language of Apol. Ar. 71, to fix the exposure of Arsenius not
   very long before the summoning of the council of Tyre, but long enough
   to allow for the renewed intrigues which led to its being convened. But
   this pushes us back behind the intended council of CÃ¦sarea in 334; we
   seem therefore compelled to keep Arsenius waiting at Tyre from about
   333 to the summer of 335.

   It must be remembered that the Council of Tyre was merely a parergon to
   the great Dedication Meeting at Jerusalem, which was to celebrate the
   Tricennalia of Constantine's reign by consecrating his grand church on
   Mount Calvary. On their way to Jerusalem the bishops were to despatch
   at Tyre their business of quieting the Egyptian troubles [46] (Eus. V.
   C. iv. 41). To Tyre accordingly Athanasius repaired. He left Alexandria
   on July 11, 335, and was absent, as it proved (according to the
   reckoning of the Hist. Aceph., below, p. 496), two years, four months
   and eleven days.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [42] Eager opposition, however, was not lacking. The accounts are
   confused, but the statement of the bishops leaves room for a strong
   minority of malcontents, who may have elected Theonas' (was he the
   exiled Arian bishop of Marmarica? the electors of Theonas' in Epiph.
   HÃ¦r. 68 are Meletians, but there is no Theonas in the Meletian
   catalogue of 327; the Arians and Meletians very likely combined; the
   latter properly had no votes, but they were not likely to regard this;
   see Gwatkin, p. 66, note, Church Quarterly Review. xvi. p. 393). The
   protests of the opposition were apparently disregarded and Athanasius
   consecrated before the other side considered the question as closed,
   (The statement of Epiph. HÃ¦r. 69, that the Arians chose one Achillas,
   is unsupported.) Athanasius was probably only just thirty years old,
   and his opponents did not fail to question whether he were not under
   the canonical age.

   [43] Soz. ii. 21, 22: the account is not very clear; probably there was
   a gradual approximation, the first step being the Meletian support of
   the Arian Theonas against Athanasius in 328, if the view suggested
   above is correct.

   [44] Fest. Ind. iii. The Index is of course right in giving 330-331 as
   the year of his departure for Nicomedia, but makes a slip in assigning
   his absence as the cause of delay in the despatch of the Letter for
   that year instead of for the following one. See p. 512 note 1.

   [45] Who perhaps visited Tyre himself at this time, according to an
   allusion in Hist. Aceph. xii., see Sievers, Einl. p. 131.

   [46] The conduct of Constantine will appear fairly consistent if we
   suppose that after ordering the investigation at Antioch, supr. (332?)
   he received proofs (333) of the falsehood of the Arsenius story, but
   that, finding that the complaints were constantly renewed, and that
   Ath. refused to meet his accusers at CÃ¦sarea, he yielded to the
   suggestion (Eus. Nic.?) that the assembly of so many bishops at
   Jerusalem might be a valuable opportunity for finally dealing with so
   troublesome a matter. He desired peace, and had not lost his faith in
   councils. Hefele follows Socrates i. 29, in his error as to the date of
   the discovery of Arsenius (E. Tr. ii. 21).
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§5. The Council of Tyre and First Exile of Athanasius, 335-337.

   Many of the bishops who were making their way to the great festival met
   at Tyre. The Arian element was very strong. Eusebius of Nicomedia,
   Narcissus, Maris, Theognis, Patrophilus, George, now bishop of
   Laodicea, are all familiar names. Ursacius and Valens, young [47] both
   in years and in mind' make their first entrance on the stage of
   ecclesiastical intrigue; Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea headed a large body of
   conservative' malcontents: in the total number of perhaps 150, the
   friends of Athanasius were outnumbered by nearly two to one. (See
   Gwatkin's note, p. 85, Hefele ii. 17, Eng Tra.) Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea
   took the chair (yet see D.C.B. ii. 316^b). The proceedings of the
   Council were heated and disorderly; promiscuous accusations were flung
   from side to side; the president himself was charged by an excited
   Egyptian Confessor with having sacrificed to idols (p. 104, n. 2),
   while against Athanasius every possible charge was raked up. The
   principal one was that of harshness and violence. Callinicus, bishop of
   Pelusium, according to a later story [48] , had taken up the cause of
   Ischyras, and been deposed by Athanasius in consequence. A certain Mark
   had been appointed to supersede him, and he had been subjected to
   military force. Certain Meletian bishops who had refused to communicate
   with Athanasius on account of his irregular election, had been beaten
   and imprisoned. A document from Alexandria testified that the Churches
   were emptied on account of the strong popular feeling against these
   proceedings. The number of witnesses, and the evident readiness of the
   majority of bishops to believe the worst against him, inspired
   Athanasius with profound misgivings as to his chance of obtaining
   justice. He had in vain objected to certain bishops as biassed judges;
   when it was decided to investigate the case of Ischyras on the spot,
   the commission of six was chosen from among the very persons challenged
   (p. 138). Equally unsuccessful was the protest of the Egyptian bishops
   against the credit of the Meletian witnesses (p. 140). But on one point
   the accusers walked into a trap. The hand of Arsenius' was produced,
   and naturally made a deep impression (Thdt. H. E. i. 30). But
   Athanasius was ready. Did you know Arsenius personally?' Yes' is the
   eager reply from many sides. Promptly Arsenius is ushered in alive,
   wrapped up in a cloak. The Synod expected an explanation of the way he
   had lost his hand. Athanasius turned up his cloak and shewed that one
   hand at least was there. There was a moment of suspense, artfully
   managed by Athanasius. Then the other hand was exposed, and the
   accusers were requested to point out whence the third had been cut off
   (Socr. i. 29). This was too much for John Arcaph, who precipitately
   fled (so Socr., he seems to have gone to Egypt with the couriers
   mentioned below, cf. p. 142). But the Eusebians were made of sterner
   stuff: the whole affair was a piece of magic; or there had been an
   attempt to murder Arsenius, who had hid himself from fear. At any rate
   Athanasius must not be allowed to clear himself so easily. Accordingly,
   in order partly to gain time and partly to get up a more satisfactory
   case, they prevailed on Count Dionysius, in the face of strong
   remonstrances from Athanasius (p. 138), to despatch a commission of
   enquiry to the Mareotis in order to ascertain the real facts about
   Ischyras. The nature of the commission may be inferred, firstly, from
   its composition, four strong Arians and two (Theodore of Heraclea, and
   Macedonius of Mopsuestia) reactionaries; secondly, from the fact that
   they took Ischyras with them, but left Macarius behind in custody;
   thirdly, from the fact that couriers were sent to Egypt with four days'
   start, and with an urgent message to the Meletians to collect at once
   in as large numbers as possible at Irene, so as to impress the
   commissioners with the importance of the Meletian community at that
   place. The Egyptian bishops present at Tyre handed in strongly-worded
   protests to the Council, and to Count Dionysius, who received also a
   weighty remonstrance from the respected Alexander, Bishop of
   Thessalonica. This drew forth from him an energetic protest to the
   Eusebians (p. 142 sq.) against the composition of the commission. His
   protest was not, however, enforced in any practical way, and the
   Egyptians thereupon appealed to the Emperor (ib.). Athanasius himself
   escaped in an open boat with four of his bishops, and found his way to
   Constantinople, where he arrived on October 30. The Emperor was out
   riding when he was accosted by one of a group of pedestrians. He could
   scarcely credit his eyes and the assurance of his attendants that the
   stranger was none other than the culprit of Tyre. Much annoyed at his
   appearance, he refused all communication; but the persistency of
   Athanasius and the reasonableness of his demand prevailed. The Emperor
   wrote to Jerusalem to summon to his presence all who had been at the
   Council of Tyre (pp. 105, 145).

   Meanwhile the Mareotic Commission had proceeded with its task. Their
   report was kept secret, but eventually sent to Julius of Rome, who
   handed it over to Athanasius in 339 (p. 143). Their enquiry was carried
   on with the aid of Philagrius the prefect, a strong Arian sympathiser,
   whose guard pricked the witnesses if they failed to respond to the
   hints of the commissioners and the threats of the prefect himself. The
   clergy of Alexandria and the Mareotis were excluded from the court, and
   catechumens, Jews and heathen, none of whom could properly have been
   present on the occasion, were examined as to the interruption of the
   eucharistic service by Macarius (p. 119). Even with these precautions
   the evidence was not all that could be wished. To begin with, it had
   all taken place on an ordinary week-day, when there would be no
   Communion (pp. 115, 125, 143); secondly, when Macarius came in Ischyras
   was in bed; thirdly, certain witnesses whom Athanasius had been accused
   of secreting came forward in evidence of the contrary (p. 107). The
   prefect consoled himself by letting loose the violence of the heathen
   mob (p. 108) against the virgins' of the Church. The catholic party
   were helpless; all they could do was to protest in writing to the
   commission, the council, and the prefect (pp. 138-140. The latter
   protest is dated 10th of Thoth, i.e. Sep. 8, 335, Diocletian
   leap-year).

   The commission returned to Tyre, where the council passed a resolution
   (Soz. ii. 25) deposing Athanasius. They then proceeded to Jerusalem for
   the Dedication [49] of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Here Arius
   with certain others (probably including Euzoius) was received to
   communion on the strength of the confession of faith he had presented
   to Constantine a few years before, and the assembled bishops drew up a
   synodal letter announcing the fact to Egypt and the Church at large
   (pp. 144, 460). At this juncture the summons from Constantine arrived.
   The terms of it shewed that the Emperor was not disposed to hear more
   of the broken chalice or the murdered Arsenius: but the Eusebians were
   not at a loss. They advised the bishops to go quietly to their homes,
   while five of the inner circle, accompanied by Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea, who
   had a panegyric to deliver in the imperial presence, responded to the
   summons of royalty. They made short work of Athanasius. The whole
   farrago of charges examined at Tyre was thrown aside. He had threatened
   to starve the paneudaimon patris, the chosen capital of Constantine, by
   stopping the grain ships which regularly left Alexandria every autumn.
   It was in vain for Athanasius to protest that he had neither the means
   nor the power to do anything of the kind. You are a rich man,' replied
   Eusebius of Nicomedia, and can do whatever you like.' The Emperor was
   touched in a sore place [50] . He promptly ordered the banishment of
   Athanasius to Treveri, whither he started, as it would seem, on Feb. 5,
   336 (pp. 105, 146, 503, note 11). The friends of Athanasius professed
   to regard the banishment as an act of imperial clemency, in view of
   what might have been treated as a capital matter, involving as it did
   the charge of treason (p. 105); and Constantine II., immediately after
   his father's death, stated (pp. 146, 272, 288) in a letter (written
   before he became Augustus in Sept. 337) that he had been sent to
   Treveri merely to keep him out of danger, and that Constantine had been
   prevented only by death from carrying out his intention of restoring
   him. These charitable constructions need not be rudely ignored; but in
   all probability the anxiety to be rid of a cause of disturbance was at
   least one motive with the peace-loving Emperor. At any rate the
   Eusebians could not obtain the imperial sanction to their proposed
   election of a successor (Pistus?) to Athanasius. On his return after
   the death of Constantine he found his see waiting for him unoccupied
   (Apol. c. Ar. 29, p. 115).

   The close of the Tricennalia was made the occasion of a council at
   Constantinople (winter 335-336). Marcellus was deposed for heresy and
   Basil nominated to the see of Ancyra, Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea undertaking
   to refute the new Samosatene.' Other minor depositions were apparently
   carried out at the same time, and several Western bishops, including
   Protogenes of Sardica, had reason later on to repent of their
   signatures to the proceedings (Hil. Fragm. iii.).

   Death of Arius. From Jerusalem Arius had gone to Alexandria, but (Soz.
   ii. 29) had not succeeded in obtaining admission to the Communion of
   the Church there. Accordingly he repaired to the capital about the time
   of the Council just mentioned. The Eusebians resolved that here at any
   rate he should not be repelled. Arius appeared before the Emperor and
   satisfied him by a sworn profession of orthodoxy, and a day was fixed
   for his reception to communion. The story of the distress caused to the
   aged bishop Alexander is well known. He was heard to pray in the church
   that either Arius or himself might be taken away before such an outrage
   to the faith should be permitted. As a matter of fact Arius died
   suddenly the day before his intended reception. His friends ascribed
   his death to magic, those of Alexander to the judgment of God, the
   public generally to the effect of excitement on a diseased heart (Soz.
   l. c.). Athanasius, while taking the second view, describes the
   occurrence with becoming sobriety and reserve (pp. 233, 565). Alexander
   himself died very soon after, and Paul was elected in his place (D.C.B.
   art. Macedonius (2)), but was soon banished on some unknown charge,
   whereupon Eusebius of Nicomedia was translated to the capital see
   (between 336 and 340; date uncertain. Cf. D.C.B. ii. 367a).

   Of the sojourn of Athanasius at Treveri, the noble home of the Emperors
   on the banks of the Mosel, we know few details, but his presence there
   appeals to the historic imagination. (See D.C.B. i. 186a.) He cannot
   have been there much above a year. He kept the Easter festival,
   probably of 336, certainly of 337, in the still unfinished Church (p.
   244: the present Cathedral is said to occupy the site of what was then
   an Imperial palace: but the main palace is apparently represented by
   the Roman baths).' He was not suffered to want (p. 146): he had certain
   Egyptian brethren with him; and found a sympathetic friend in the good
   Bishop Maximinus (cf. p. 239). The tenth festal letter, Â§1, preserves a
   short extract from a letter written from Trier to his clergy.

   Constantine died at Nicomedia, having previously received baptism from
   the hands of Eusebius, on Whit-Sunday, May 22, 337. None of his sons
   were present, and the will is said to have been entrusted to the Arian
   chaplain mentioned above (p. xxxiv). Couriers carried the news to the
   three CÃ¦sars, and at a very moderate [51] rate of reckoning, it may
   have been known at Trier by about June 4. Constantine, as the eldest
   son, probably expected more from his father's will than he actually
   obtained. At any rate, on June 17 he wrote a letter to the people and
   clergy of Alexandria, announcing the restoration of their bishop in
   pursuance of an intention of his father's, which only death had cut
   short. Constantius meanwhile hastened (from the East, probably Antioch)
   to Constantinople (D.C.B. i. 651): he too had expectations, for he was
   his father's favourite. The brothers met at Sirmium, and agreed upon a
   division of the Empire, Constantius taking the East, Constans Italy and
   Illyricum, and Constantine the Gauls and Africa. On Sep. 9 they
   formally assumed the title Augustus [52] . Athanasius had apparently
   accompanied Constantine to Sirmium, and on his way eastward met
   Constantius at Viminacium (p. 240), his first interview with his future
   persecutor. He presently reached Constantinople (p. 272), and on his
   way southward, at CÃ¦sarea in Cappadocia, again met Constantius, who was
   hurrying to the Persian frontier. On Nov. 23 he reached Alexandria amid
   great rejoicings (pp. 104, 503, Fest. Ind. x.), the clergy especially
   esteeming that the happiest day of their lives.' But the happiness was
   marred by tumults (Soz. ii. 2, 5, Hil. Fragm. iii. 8, Fest. Ind. xi.,
   next year again'), which were, however, checked by the civil power, the
   prefect Theodorus being, apparently, favourable to Athanasius (pp. 102,
   527, note 2). The festal letter for 338 would seem to have been
   finished at Alexandria, but the point is not absolutely clear. Here
   begins his second period of quiet,' of one year, four months and
   twenty-four days, i.e., from Athyr 27 (Nov. 23), 337, to Pharmuthi 21
   (April 16), 339.

   Â§6. Renewal of Troubles. Second Exile. Pistus and Gregory, Culmination
   of Eusebian Intrigue. Rome and Sardica. (337-346).

   (1). The stay of Athanasius at Alexandria was brief and troubled. The
   city was still disturbed by Arian malcontents, who had the sympathy of
   Jews and Pagans, and it was reported that the monks, and especially the
   famous hermit Antony, were on their side. This impression, however, was
   dissipated by the appearance of the great Ascetic himself, who, at the
   urgent request of the orthodox (pp. 214 sq., 503), consented to shew
   himself for two days in the uncongenial atmosphere of the city. The
   mystery and marvellous reputation, which even then surrounded this
   much-talked-of character, attracted Christians and heathen alike, in
   large numbers, to hear and see him, and, if possible, to derive some
   physical benefit from his touch. He denounced Arianism as the worst of
   heresies, and was solemnly escorted out of town by the bishop in
   person. As an annalist toward the close of the century tells us,
   Antony, the great leader, came to Alexandria, and though he remained
   there only two days, shewed himself wonderful in many things, and
   healed many. He departed on the third of Messori' (i.e., July 27, 338).

   Meanwhile the Eusebians were busy. In the new Emperor Constantius, the
   Nicomedian found a willing patron: probably his translation to the See
   of Constantinople falls at this time. It was represented to the Emperor
   that the restoration of the exiled Bishops in 337, and especially that
   of Athanasius, was against all ecclesiastical order. Men deposed by a
   Synod of the Church had presumed to return to their sees under the
   sanction of the secular authority. This was technically true, but the
   proceedings at Tyre were regarded by Athan. as depriving that Synod of
   any title to ecclesiastical authority (pp. 104, 271). It is impossible
   to accept au pied de la lettre the protests on either side against
   state interference with the Church: both parties were willing to use it
   on their own side, and to protest against its use by their opponents.
   Constantine had summoned [53] the Council of NicÃ¦a, had (Soz. i. 17)
   fixed the order of its proceedings, and had enforced its decisions by
   civil penalties. The indignant rhetoric of Hist. Ar. 52 (p. 289) might
   mutatis nominibus have been word for word the remonstrance of a
   Secundus or Theonas against the great Ecumenical Synod of Christendom.
   At Tyre, Jerusalem, and CP., the Eusebians had their turn, and again at
   Antioch, 338-341. The Council of Sardica relied on the protection of
   Constans, that of Philippopolis on Constantius. The reign of the latter
   was the period of Arian triumph; that of Theodosius secured authority
   to the Catholics. The only consistent opponents of civil intervention
   in Church affairs were the Donatists in the West and the Eunomians or
   later Arians in the East (with the obscure exception of Secundus and
   Theonas, the original Arians cannot claim the compliment paid by
   Fialon, p. 115, to their independence). To the Donatists is due the
   classical protest against Erastianism, Quid Imperatori cum
   ecclesia'(D.C.B. i. 652). Believing, as the present writer does, that
   the Donatist protest expresses a true principle, and that the
   subjection of religion to the State is equally mischievous with that of
   the State to the Church, it is impossible not to regret these
   consequences of the conversion of Constantine. But allowance must be
   made for the sanguine expectations with which the astonishing novelty
   of a Christian Emperor filled men's minds. It was only as men came to
   realise that the civil sword might be drawn in support of heresy that
   they began to reflect on the impropriety of allowing to even a
   Christian Emperor a voice in Church councils. Athanasius was the first
   to grasp this clearly. The voice of protest [54] sounds in the letter
   of the Egyptian Synod of 338-9; throughout his exiles he steadily
   regarded himself, and was regarded by his flock, as the sole rightful
   Bishop of Alexandria, and continued to issue his Easter Letters from
   first to last. At the same time, it must be admitted that if he was
   right in returning to Alexandria in 337 without restoration by a Synod,
   he could not logically object to the return of Eusebius and Theognis
   (p. 104), who had not been deposed at NicÃ¦a, but banished by the
   Emperor. The technical rights of Chrestus and Amphion (l. c.) were no
   better than those of Gregory or George. The spiritual elevation of
   Athanasius over the head and shoulders of his opponents is plain to
   ourselves; we see clearly the moral contrast between the councils of
   Rome and Antioch (340-41), of Sardica and Philippopolis (343), of
   Alexandria (362) and Seleucia (359). But to men like the Eastern
   conservatives' the technical point of view necessarily presented itself
   with great force, and in judging of their conduct we must not assume
   that it was either meaningless diabolism' or deliberate sympathy with
   Arianism that led so many bishops of good character to see in
   Athanasius and the other exiles contumacious offenders against Church
   order. (I am quite unable to accept M. Fialon's sweeping verdict upon
   the majority of Oriental bishops as weak, vicious, more devoted to
   their own interests than to the Church,' &c., p. 116. He takes as
   literally exact the somewhat turgid rhetorical complaints of Greg.
   Naz.)

   But the Eusebians were not limited to technical complaints. They had
   stirring accounts to give of the disorders which the return of
   Athanasius had excited, of the ruthless severity with which they had
   been put down by the prefect, who was, it was probably added, a mere
   tool in the hands of the bishop. Accordingly in the course of 338 the
   subservient Theodorus was recalled, and Philagrius the Cappadocian, who
   had governed with immense [55] popularity in 335-337 (Fest. Ind. and p.
   107 sq.), was sent to fill the office a second time. This was regarded
   at Alexandria as an Arian triumph (see p. 527, note 2). His arrival did
   not tend to allay the disorders. Old charges against Athanasius were
   raked up, and a new one added, namely that of embezzlement of the corn
   appropriated to the support of widows by the imperial bounty. The
   Emperor appears to have sent a letter of complaint to Athanasius (p.
   273), but to have paid little attention to his defence. The Eusebians
   now ventured to send a bishop of their own to Alexandria in the person
   of Pistus, one of the original Arian presbyters, who was consecrated by
   the implacable Secundus. The date of this proceeding is obscure,
   probably it was conducted in an irregular manner, so as to render it
   possible to ignore it altogether if, as proved to be the case, a
   stronger candidate should be necessary. First, however, it was
   necessary to try the temper of the West. A deputation consisting of a
   presbyter Macarius and two deacons, Martyrius and Hesychius, was sent
   to Julius, bishop of Rome, to lay before him the enormities of
   Athanasius, Marcellus, Paul, Asclepas and the rest, and to urge the
   superior title of Pistus to the recognition of the Church. But upon
   hearing of this Athanasius summoned the Egyptian Episcopate together
   (winter 338-339), and composed a circular letter (pp. 101-110) dealing
   fully with the charges against him, especially with regard to the
   manner of his election and the irregularity of his return a year
   before. Two presbyters carried the letter in haste to Rome, and
   enlightened the Church there as to the antecedents of Pistus. Next day
   it was announced that Macarius, in spite of a bodily ailment,' had
   decamped in the night. The deacons however remained, and requested
   Julius to call a council, undertaking that if Athanasius and the
   Eusebians were confronted all the charges brought by the latter should
   be made good. This proposal seemed unobjectionable, and Julius wrote
   inviting all parties to a council at Rome, or some other place to be
   agreed upon (p. 272); his messengers to the Eusebians were the Roman
   presbyters Elpidius and Philoxenus [56] , (p. 111). The council was
   fixed for the following summer (so it would seem); but no reply was
   received from the Eusebians, who kept the presbyters in the East until
   the following January, when they at length started for Rome bearing a
   querulous and somewhat shifty reply (answered by Julius, p. 111, sqq.).
   But before the invitation had reached the Eusebians they had assembled
   at Antioch, where Constantius was in residence for the winter (laws
   dated Dec. 27; the court thereon January ? p. 92), repeated the
   deposition of Athanasius, and appointed Gregory, a Cappadocian, to
   succeed him. It had become clear that Pistus was a bad candidate;
   perhaps no formal synod could be induced to commit themselves to a man
   excommunicated at NicÃ¦a and consecrated by Secundus. At any rate they
   tried to find an unexceptionable nominee. But their first, Eusebius,
   afterwards bishop of Emesa, refused the post, and so they came to
   Gregory [57] , a former student of Alexandria, and under personal
   obligations to its bishop (Greg. Naz. Or. xxi. 15).

   All was now ready for the blow at Athanasius. It fell in Lent (pp. 94,
   503). His position since the arrival of Philagrius had been one of
   unrest. In this year again,' says our annalist, there were many
   tumults. On the xxii Phamenoth (i.e. Sunday, Mar. 18, 339) he was
   sought after by his persecutors in the night. On the next morning he
   fled from the Church of Theonas after he had baptized many. Then on the
   fourth day (Mar. 22) Gregory the Cappadocian entered the city as
   bishop' (Fest. Ind. xi.). But Athanasius (p. 95), remained quietly in
   the town for about four weeks more [58] . He drew up for circulation
   throughout the tribes' (cf. Judges xix. 29) a memorandum and appeal,
   describing the intrusion of Gregory and the gross outrages which had
   accompanied it. This letter was written on or just after Easter Day
   (April 15), and immediately after this he escaped from Alexandria and
   made his way to Rome. The data as to the duration of the periods of
   quiet' and exile fix the date of his departure for Easter Monday, April
   16. This absence from Alexandria was his longest, lasting ninety months
   and three days,' i.e. from Pharmuthi 21 (April 16) 339 to Paophi 24
   (October 21), 346.

   (2.) The Second Exile of Athanasius falls into two sections, the first
   of four years (p. 239), to the council of Sardica (339-343), the second
   of three years, to his return in Oct. 346. The odd six months cannot be
   distributed with certainty unless we can arrive at a more exact result
   than at present appears attainable for the month and duration of the
   Sardican synod.

   In May, 339, Athanasius, accompanied by a few of his clergy (story of
   the detachment' of his monk Ammonius in Socr. iv. 23, sub fin.),
   arrived at Rome. He was within three months followed by Marcellus, Paul
   of CP., Asclepas, and other exiles who had been restored at the end of
   337 but had once more been ejected. Soon after, Carpones, an original
   Arian of Alexandria, appeared as envoy of Gregory. He confirmed all
   that had been alleged against Pistus, but failed to convince Julius
   that his own bishop was anything but an Arian. Meanwhile time wore on,
   and no reply came from the Eusebians. Athanasius gave himself up to
   enforced leisure and to the services of the Church. Instead of his
   usual Easter letter for the following spring, he sent a few lines to
   the clergy of Alexandria and a letter to his right-hand man, bishop
   Serapion of Thmuis, requesting him to make the necessary announcement
   of the season. Gregory made his first attempt (apparently also his
   last) to fix the Easter Festival, but in the middle of Lent, to the
   amusement of the public, discovered that a mistake had been made, the
   correction of which involved his adherents in an extra week of Lenten
   austerities. We can well imagine that the spectacle of the abstracted
   asceticism of Ammonius aroused the curiosity and veneration of the
   Roman Christians, and thus gave an impulse to the ascetic life in the
   West (see Jerome, cited below, p. 191). That is all we know of the life
   of Athanasius during the first eighteen months of his stay at Rome.

   In the early spring of 340 the presbyters returned (see above) with a
   letter from a number of bishops, including the Eusebian leaders, who
   had assembled at Antioch in January. This letter is carefully dissected
   in the reply of the Roman Council, and appears to have been highly
   acrimonious in its tone. Julius kept it secret for a time (p. 111),
   hoping against hope that after all some of the Orientals would come for
   the council; but at length he gave up all expectations of the kind, and
   convoked the bishops of Italy, who examined the cases of the various
   exiles (p. 114). All the old charges against Athanasius were gone into
   with the aid of the Mareotic report (the ex parte character of which
   Julius strongly emphasises) and of the account of the proceedings at
   Tyre. The council had no difficulty in pronouncing Athanasius
   completely innocent on all points. The charge of ignoring the
   proceedings of a council was disposed of by pointing out the
   uncanonical character of Gregory's appointment (p. 115), and the
   infraction by the complainants of the decrees of NicÃ¦a. With regard to
   Marcellus, he responded to the request of the bishops by volunteering a
   written confession of his faith (p. 116, Epiph. HÃ¦r. 72), which was in
   fact the creed of the Roman Church itself (Caspari, Quellen iii. 28,
   note, argues that the creed must have been tendered at an earlier
   visit, 336-337, but without cogent reasons). Either Julius and his
   bishops were (like the fathers of Sardica) very easily satisfied, or
   Marcellus exercised extreme reserve as to his peculiar tenets (Zahn, p.
   71, makes out the best case he can for his candour). The other exiles
   were also pronounced innocent, and the synod restored' them all. It
   remained to communicate the result to the Oriental bishops. This was
   done by Julius in a letter drawn up in the name of the council, and
   preserved by Athanasius in his Apology. Its subject matter has been
   sufficiently indicated, but its statesmanlike logic and grave severity
   must be appreciated by reference to the document itself. It has been
   truly called one of the ablest documents in the entire controversy.' It
   is worth observing that Julius makes no claim whatever to pass a final
   judgment as successor of S. Peter, although the Orientals had expressly
   asserted the equal authority of all bishops, however important the
   cities in which they ruled (p. 113); on the contrary he merely claims
   that without his own consent, proceedings against bishops would lack
   the weight of universal consent (p. 118). At the same time he claims to
   be in possession of the traditions of S. Paul and especially of S.
   Peter, and is careful to found upon precedent (that of Dionysius) a
   claim to be consulted in matters alleged against a bishop of
   Alexandria. This claim, by its modesty, is in striking contrast with
   that which Socrates (ii. 17) and Sozom. (iii. 8, 10) make for
   him,--that owing to the greatness of his see, the care of all the
   churches pertained to him: and this again, which represents what the
   Greek Church of the early fifth century was accustomed to hear from
   Rome, is very different from the claim to a jurisdiction of divine
   right which we find formulated in Leo the Great.

   The letter of Julius was considered at the famous Council of the
   Dedication (of Constantine's Golden' Church at Antioch, see Eus. V. C.
   iii. 50), held in the summer of 341 (between May 22 and Sept. 1, see
   Gwatkin, p. 114, note). Eusebius of Constantinople was there (he had
   only a few months longer to live), and most of the Arian leaders.
   CÃ¦sarea was represented by Acacius, who had succeeded Eusebius some two
   years before; a man of Whom we shall hear more. But of the ninety-odd
   bishops who attended, the majority must have been conservative in
   feeling, such as Dianius of CÃ¦sarea, who possibly presided. At any rate
   Hilary (de Syn. 32) calls it a synod of saints,' and its canons passed
   into the accepted body of Church Law. Their reply to Julius is not
   extant, but we gather from the historians that it was not conciliatory.
   (Socr. ii. 15, 17; Soz. iii. 8, 10; they are in such hopeless confusion
   as to dates and the order of events that it is difficult to use them
   here; Theodoret is more accurate but less full.)

   But the council marks an epoch in a more important respect; with it
   begins the formal Doctrinal Reaction against the Nicene Formula. We
   have traces of previous confessions, such as that of Arius and Euzoius,
   330-335, and an alleged creed drawn up at CP. in 336. But only now
   begins the long series of attempts to raise some other formula to a
   position of equality with the Nicene, so as to eventually depose the
   homoousion from its position as an ecumenical test.

   The first suggestion of a new creed came from the Arian bishops, who
   propounded a formula (p. 146, Â§22), with a disavowal of any intention
   of disparaging that of NicÃ¦a (Socr. ii. 10), but suspiciously akin to
   the evasive confession of Arius, and prefaced with a suicidally worded
   protest against being considered as followers of the latter. The fate
   of this creed in the council is obscure; but it would seem to have
   failed to commend itself to the majority, who put forward a creed
   alleged to have been composed by Lucian the martyr. This (see above, p.
   xxviii, and p. 461, notes 5-9), was hardly true of the creed as it
   stood, but it may have been signed by Lucian as a test when he made his
   peace with bishop Cyril. At any rate the creed is catholic in asserting
   the exact Likeness of the Son to the Father's Essence (yet the Arians
   could admit this as de facto true, though not originally so; only the
   word Essence would, if honestly taken, fairly exclude their sense), but
   anti-Nicene in omitting the homoousion, and in the phrase te men
   hupostasei tria, te de sumphoni& 139; hen, an artfully chosen point of
   contact between Origen on the one hand, and Asterius, Lucian, and Paul
   of Samosata on the other. The anathemas, also, let in an Arian
   interpretation. This creed is usually referred to as the Creed of the
   Dedication' or Lucianic' Creed, and represents, on the one hand the
   extreme limit of concession to which Arians were willing to go, on the
   other the theological rallying point of the gradually forming body of
   reasoned conservative opinion which under the nickname of
   semi-Arianism' (Epiph. HÃ¦r. 73; it was repudiated by Basil of Ancyra,
   &c.) gradually worked toward the recognition of the Nicene formula.

   A third formula was presented by Theophronius, bishop of Tyana, as a
   personal statement of belief, and was widely signed by way of approval.
   It insists like the Lucianic creed on the pretemporal gennesis, against
   Marcellus, adding two other points (hypostatic pre-existence and
   eternal kingdom of the Son) in the same direction, and closing with an
   anathema against Marcellus, Sabellius, Paul, and all who communicate
   with any of their supporters. This was of course a direct defiance of
   Julius and the Westerns (Mr. Gwatkin, by a slip, assigns this anathema
   to the fourth' creed).

   Lastly, a few months after the council (late autumn of 341) a few
   bishops reassembled in order to send a deputation to Constans (since
   340 sole Western Emperor). They decided to substitute for the genuine
   creeds of the council a fourth formulary, which accordingly the Arians
   Maris and Narcissus, and the neutrals Theodore of Heraclea and Mark of
   Arethusa, conveyed to the West. The assertion of the eternal reign of
   Christ was strengthened, and the name of Marcellus omitted, but the
   Nicene anathemas were skilfully adapted so as to strike at the
   Marcellian and admit the Arian doctrine of the divine Sonship. This
   creed became the basis on which the subsequent Arianising confessions
   of 343 (Philippopolis), 344 (Macrostich), and 351 (Sirmium) were
   moulded by additions to and modifications of the anathemas. This series
   of creeds mark the stationary period of Arianism,' i.e. between the
   close of the first generation (Arius, Asterius, Eusebius of Nicomedia)
   and the beginnings of the divergence of parties under the sole reign of
   Constantius. At present opposition to the school of Marcellus and to
   the impregnable strength of the West under a Catholic Emperor kept the
   reactionary party united.

   It has been necessary to dwell upon the work of this famous Council in
   view of its subsequent importance. It is easy to see how the Eastern
   bishops were prevailed upon to take the bold step of putting forth a
   Creed to rival the Nicene formula. The formal approval of Marcellus at
   Rome shewed, so they felt, the inadequacy of that formula to exclude
   Sabellianism, or rather the direct support which that heresy could find
   in the word homoÃ¼sion.' This being so, provided they made it clear that
   they were not favouring Arianism, they would be doing no more than
   their duty in providing a more efficient test. But here the Arian group
   saw their opportunity. Conservative willingness to go behind NicÃ¦a must
   be made to subserve the supreme end of revoking the condemnation of
   Arianism. Hence the confusion of counsels reflected in the multiplicity
   of creeds. The result pleased no one. The Lucianic Creed, with its
   anti-Arian clauses, tempered by equivocal qualifications, was a feeble
   and indirect weapon against Marcellus, who could admit in a sense the
   pre-Ã¦onian gennesis and the true' sonship. On the other hand, the three
   creeds which only succeeded in gaining secondary ratification, while
   express against Marcellus, were worthless as against Arianism. On the
   whole, the fourth creed, in spite of its irregular sanction, was found
   the most useful for the time (341-351); but as their doctrinal position
   took definite form, the Conservative wing fell back on the Lucianic'
   Creed, and found in it a bridge to the Nicene (cf. pp. 470, 472, Hil.
   de Syn. 33, and Gwatkin, p. 119, note).

   (3.) Athanasius remained in Rome more than three years after his
   departure from Alexandria (April, 339-May? 342, see p. 239). During the
   last of these years, the dispute connected with him had been referred
   by Julius to Constans, who had requested his brother to send some
   Oriental bishops with a statement of their case: this was the reason of
   the deputation (see above) of the winter of 341. They found Constans at
   Treveri, but owing to the warnings of good Bishop Maximinus [59] , he
   refused to accept their assurances, and sent them ignominiously away.
   This probably falls in the summer of 342, the deputation on arriving in
   Italy having found that Constans had already left Milan for his
   campaign against the Franks (Gwatkin, p. 122, note 3). If this be so,
   Constans had already made up his mind that a General Council was the
   only remedy, and had written to Constantius to arrange for one. Before
   leaving Milan he had summoned Athanasius from Rome, and announced to
   him what he had done. The young Prince was evidently an admirer of
   Athanasius, who had received from him in reply to a letter of
   self-defence, written from Alexandria, an order for certain puktia, or
   bound volumes of the Scriptures (see Montfaucon, Animadv. xv., in Migne
   xxv., p. clxxvi.). The volumes had been delivered before this date.
   Constans hurried off to Gaul, while Athanasius remained at Milan, where
   he afterwards received a summons to follow the Emperor to Treveri [60]
   ; here he met the venerable Hosius and others, and learned that the
   Emperors had fixed upon Sardica (now Sophia in Bulgaria), on the
   frontier line of the dominions of Constans [61] , as the venue for the
   great Council, which was to assemble in the ensuing summer. Athanasius
   must have kept the Easter of 343 at Treveri: he had written his usual
   Easter letter (now lost) most probably from Rome or Milan, in the
   previous spring. The date of assembly and duration of the Sardican
   synod are, unfortunately, obscure. But the proceedings must have been
   protracted by the negotiations which ended in the departure of the
   Easterns, and (p. 124, note 2) by the care with which the evidence
   against the incriminated bishops was afterwards gone into [62] .

   We shall probably be safe in supposing that the Council occupied the
   whole of August and September, and that Constans sent Bishops Euphrates
   and Vincent to his brother at Antioch as soon as the worst weather of
   winter was over.

   The Western bishops assembled at Sardica to the number of about 95 (see
   p. 147). Athanasius, Marcellus, and Asclepas arrived with Hosius from
   Treveri. Paul of Constantinople, for some unknown reason, was absent,
   but was represented by Asclepas [63] . The Orientals came in a body,
   and with suspicion. They had the Counts Musonianus and Hesychius, and
   (according to Fest. Ind., cf. p. 276) the ex-Prefect Philagrius, as
   advisers and protectors: they were lodged in a body at the Palace of
   Sophia. The proceedings were blocked by a question of privilege. The
   Easterns demanded that the accused bishops should not be allowed to
   take their seats in the Council; the majority replied that, pending the
   present enquiry, all previous decisions against them must be in
   fairness considered suspended. There was something to be said on both
   sides (see Hefele, p. 99), but on the whole, the synod being convoked
   expressly to re-hear both sides, the majority were perhaps justified in
   refusing to exclude the accused. A long interchange (p. 119), of
   communications followed, and at last, alleging that they were summoned
   home by the news of the victory in the Persian war, the minority
   disappeared by night, sending their excuse by the Sardican Presbyter
   Eustathius (p. 275). At Philippopolis, within the dominions of
   Constantius, they halted and drew up a long and extremely wild and
   angry statement of what had occurred, deposing and condemning all
   concerned, from Hosius, Julius and Athanasius downward. They added the
   Antiochene Confession (fourth' of 341), with the addition of some
   anathemas directed at the system of Marcellus. Among the signatures,
   which included most of the surviving Arian leaders, along with Basil of
   Ancyra, and other moderate men, we recognise that of Ischyras, bishop
   from the Mareotis,' who had enjoyed the dignity without the burdens of
   the Episcopate since the Council of Tyre (p. 144). The document was
   sent far and wide, among the rest to the Donatists of Africa (Hef., p.
   171).

   This rupture doomed the purpose of the council to failure: instead of
   leading to agreement it had made the difference a hopeless one. But the
   Westerns were still a respectable number, and might do much to forward
   the cause of justice and of the Nicene Faith. Two of the Easterns had
   joined them, Asterius of Petra and Arius, bishop of an unknown see in
   Palestine. The only other Oriental present, Diodorus of Tenedos,
   appears to have come, like Asclepas, &c., independently of the rest.
   The work of the council was partly judicial, partly legislative. The
   question was raised of issuing a supplement to, or formula explanatory
   of, the Nicene creed, and a draft (preserved Thdt. H. E. ii. 8) was
   actually made, but the council declined to sanction anything which
   should imply that the Nicene creed was insufficient (p. 484, correcting
   Thdt. ubi supra, and Soz. iii. 12).

   The charges against all the exiles were carefully examined and
   dismissed. This was also the case with the complaints against the
   orthodoxy of Marcellus, who was allowed to evade the very point which
   gave most offence (p. 125). Probably the ocular evidence (p. 124) of
   the violence which many present had suffered, indisposed the fathers to
   believe any accusations from such a quarter. The synod next proceeded
   to legislate. Their canons were twenty in number, the most important
   being canons 3-5, which permit a deposed bishop to demand the reference
   of his case to Julius bishop of Rome,' honouring the memory of Peter
   the Apostle;' the deposition to be suspended pending such reference;
   the Roman bishop, if the appeal seem reasonable, to request the
   rehearing of the case in its own province, and if at the request of the
   accused he sends a presbyter to represent him, such presbyter to rank
   as though he were his principal in person. The whole scheme appears to
   be novel and to have been suggested by the history of the case of the
   exiles. The canons are very important in their subsequent history, but
   need not be discussed here. (Elaborate discussions in Hefele, pp.
   112-129; see also D.C.A. pp. 127 sq., 1658, 1671, Greenwood, Cath.
   Petr. i. 204-208, D.C.B. iii. 662 a, and especially 529-531.) The only
   legislation, however, to which Athanasius alludes is that establishing
   a period of 50 years during which Rome and Alexandria should agree as
   to the period for Easter (Fest. Ind. xv., infr. p. 544, also Hefele pp.
   157 sqq.). The arrangement averted a dispute in 346, but differences
   occurred in spite of it in 349, 350, 360, and 368.

   The synod addressed an encyclical letter to all Christendom (p. 123),
   embodying their decisions and announcing their deposition of eight or
   nine Oriental bishops (including Theodore of Heraclea, Acacius, and
   several Arian leaders) for complicity with Arianism. They also wrote to
   the Church of Alexandria and to the bishops of Egypt with special
   reference to Athanasius and to the Alexandrian Church, to Julius
   announcing their decisions, and to the Mareotis (Migne xxvi. 1331 sqq.
   printed with Letters 46, 47. Hefele ii. 165 questions the genuineness
   of all three, but without reason; see p. 554, note 1).

   The effect of the Council was not at first pacific. Constantius shared
   the indignation of the Eastern bishops, and began severe measures
   against all the Nicene-minded bishops in his dominions (pp. 275 sqq).
   Theodulus, Bishop of Trajanople, died of his injuries before the
   Sardican Bishops had completed their work. At Hadrianople savage
   cruelties were perpetrated (ib.); and a close watch was instituted in
   case Athanasius should attempt to return on the strength of his
   synodical acquittal. Accordingly, he passed the winter and spring at
   Naissus (now Nish, see Fest. Ind. xvi.), and during the summer, in
   obedience to an invitation from Constans, repaired to Aquileia, where
   he spent the Easter of 345.

   Meanwhile, Constans had made the cause of the Sardican majority his
   own. At the beginning of the year 344 he sent two of its most respected
   members to urge upon Constantius the propriety of restoring the exiles.
   Either now or later he hinted that refusal would be regarded by him as
   a casus belli. His remonstrance gained unexpected moral support from an
   episode, strange even in that age of unprincipled intrigue. In rage and
   pain at the apparent success of the envoys, Stephen, Bishop of Antioch,
   sought to discredit them by a truly diabolical trick (see p. 276). Its
   discovery, just after Easter, 344, roused the moral sense of
   Constantius. A Council was summoned, and met during the summer [64] (p.
   462, Â§26, three years after' the Dedication at Midsummer, 341). Stephen
   was ignominiously deposed (see Gwatkin 125, note 1), and Leontius, an
   Arian, but a lover of quiet and a temporiser, appointed. The Council
   also re-issued the fourth' Antiochene Creed with a very long
   explanatory addition, mildly condemning certain Arian phrases, fiercely
   anathematising Marcellus and Photinus, and with a side-thrust at
   supposed implications of the Nicene formula. A deputation was sent to
   Italy, consisting of Eudoxius of Germanicia and three others. They
   reached Milan at the Synod of 345, and were able to procure a
   condemnation of Photinus (not Marcellus), but on being asked to
   anathematise Arianism refused, and retired in anger. At the same Synod
   of Milan, however, Valens and Ursacius, whose deposition at Sardica was
   in imminent danger of being enforced by Constans, followed the former
   example of Eusebius of Nicomedia, Maris, Theognis, and Arius himself,
   by making their submission, which was followed up two years later by a
   letter in abject terms addressed to Julius, and another in a tone of
   veiled insolence to Athanasius (p. 131). In return, they were able to
   beat up a Synod at Sirmium against Photinus (Hil. Frag. ii. 19), but
   without success in the attempt to dislodge him.

   Meanwhile, Constantius had followed up the Council at Antioch by
   cancelling his severe measures against the Nicene party. He restored to
   Alexandria certain Presbyters whom he had expelled, and in the course
   of the summer wrote a public letter to forbid any further persecution
   of the Athanasians in that city. This must have been in August, 344,
   and about ten months later' (p. 277), i.e., on June 26, 345 (F. I.
   xviii.), Gregory, who had been in bad health for fully four years, died
   [65] . Constantius, according to his own statement (pp. 127, 277), had
   already before the death of Gregory written twice to Athanasius (from
   Edessa; he was at Nisibis on May 12, 345), and had sent a Presbyter to
   request him urgently to come and see him with a view to his eventual
   restoration. As Gregory was known to be in a dying state, this is quite
   intelligible, but the language of Hist. Ar. 21, which seems to put all
   three letters after Gregory's death, cannot stand if we are to accept
   the assurance of Constantius. Athanasius, at any rate, hesitated to
   obey, and stayed on at Aquileia (344 till early in 346), where he
   received a third and still more pressing invitation, promising him
   immediate restoration. He at once went to Rome to bid farewell to
   Julius, who wrote (p. 128 sq.) a most cordial and nobly-worded letter
   of congratulation for Athanasius to take home to his Church. Thence he
   proceeded to Trier to take leave of Constans (p. 239), and rapidly
   travelled by way of Hadrianople (p. 276) to Antioch (p. 240), where he
   was cordially received [66] by Constantius. His visit was short but
   remarkable. Constantius gave him the strongest assurances (pp. 277,
   285) of goodwill for the future, but begged that Athanasius would allow
   the Arians at Alexandria the use of a single Church. He replied that he
   would do so if the Eustathians of Antioch (with whom alone he
   communicated during this visit) might have the same privilege. But this
   Leontius would not sanction, so the proposal came to nothing (Soc. ii.
   23, Soz. iii. 20), and Athanasius hastened on his way. At Jerusalem he
   was detained by the welcome of a Council, which Bishop Maximus had
   summoned to greet him (p. 130), but on the twenty-first of October his
   reception by his flock took place; the people, and those in authority,
   met him a hundred miles distant' (Fest. Ind. xviii.), and amid splendid
   rejoicings (cf. p. xlii., note 3), he entered Alexandria, to remain
   there in quiet' nine years, three months and nineteen days' (Hist.
   Aceph. iv., cf. p. 496), viz., from Paophi 24 (Oct. 21), 346, to Mechir
   13 (Feb. 8), 356. This period was his longest undisturbed residence in
   his see; he entered upon it in the very prime of life (he was 48 years
   old), and its internal happiness earns it the title of a golden decade.

   [53] As he had previously referred the Donatist schism to the
   commission of Rome and the Council of Arles.

   [54] But they complain, p. 104, Â§8, of coercion not of Erastianism.

   [55] The ordinary time for the entry of the Prefect upon his duties
   seems to have been about the end of the Egyptian Year (end of August).
   Accordingly the prefectures and years in Fest. Ind. roughly correspond:
   Philagrius was already Prefect when the Mareotic Commission arrived
   (Aug. 335). According to the headings to the Festal Letters vi., vii.,
   he had superseded Paternus in 334: either the Index or the headings are
   mistaken. For the popularity of Philagrius, see Greg. Naz. Orat. xxi.
   28, who mentions that his reappointment was due to the request of a
   deputation from Alex. (this must have come from the Arians!) and that
   the rejoicings which welcomed his return exceeded any that could have
   greeted the Emperor, and nearly equalled those which had welcomed the
   return of Athanasius himself. But Gregory is a rhetorician; see p. 138,
   and Tillem. viii. 664.

   [56] It is possible, however, that these carried a second letter, after
   the arrival of Ath. See pp. 110, 273.

   [57] Gregory shewed his Arianism by employing Ammon as his secretary,
   see p. 96. The curious parallelism between Gregory and George (infr.
   Â§8),--the names differing (in Latin) by a single letter only, both
   Arians, both Cappadocians, both intruded bishops of Alexandria, both
   arriving from court, both arriving in Lent, both exercising violence,
   both charged by Ath. with the storming of churches, with similar scenes
   of desecration, maltreatment of virgins, &c., in either case,--is one
   of the strangest examples of history repeating itself within a few
   years. What wonder that the fifth-century historians confuse the two
   still further together, and that they still find followers? The most
   important point of confusion is the alleged murder of Gregory (due to
   Theodoret), who really died a natural death. It is none too soon for
   this time-honoured blunder to do the like. On the inveterate tendency
   of Georges and Gregories to coalesce, and exchange names in
   transcription (to say nothing of modern typography), see D.C.B. ii. pp.
   640-650, 778 sq., 798 sq., passim.

   [58] In some church other than Theonas,' probably Quirinus,' which
   latter, however, was stormed on Easter Day, pp. 273, 95, note 3. The
   statement, Hist. Ar. 10, that he sailed for Rome before Gregory's
   arrival is in any case verbally inexact, but it may refer to his flight
   from Theonas.'

   [59] Bitter complaint in Hil. Fragm. iii. 27; cf. infr. p. 462, Soz.
   iii. 10, who wrongly gives Italy' as the place.

   [60] This may have been in the autumn, after the close of the campaign,
   but see infr. ch. v. Â§3, c, d.

   [61] Hefele i. 91, is singular in placing it in the empire of
   Constantius. The Ichtiman range between Sophia and Philippopolis was
   the natural boundary between Thrace and Moesia, or Dacia Media.'

   [62] On the one hand the deputation after the council reached
   Constantius at Antioch about Easter (April 15), 344. They were, however
   sent not directly by the Council, but by Constans after its close
   (Thdt. ii. 8). We may be certain that their arrival at Antioch was at
   the very least two months after the close of the council; but in all
   probability the interval was much longer. Again, the course of events
   described above forbids us to put the council earlier than the early
   summer of 343. But according to the Festal Index xv. the council at any
   rate began before the end of August in that year. If the bishops left
   their churches after Easter (a very natural and usual arrangement,
   compare NicÃ¦a, the Dedication, &c.), they could easily assemble by the
   end of June. The Orientals came somewhat later. The beginning of July
   is accordingly our terminus a quo, the end of January our terminus ad
   quem. What exact part of the interval the council occupied we cannot
   decide.

   [63] The statement in the synodal letter of Philippolis that Asclepas
   had been deposed seventeen' years before is clearly corrupt. The true
   reading may be seven' (council of CP. in 336) or xiii, which might
   easily be changed to xvii. (Cf. Hefele, pp. 89, 90).

   [64] The ten months' of Hist. Ar. 21, p. 277, are to be reckoned, not
   from Easter 344, but from the letters of Const. to Alexandria some
   months after.

   [65] It must be observed that the Index is loose in its statement here:
   see Gwatkin, p. 105, Sievers, p. 108. The statement of Thdt., &c., that
   he was murdered is simply due to the usual confusion of Gregory with
   George (cf. p. xliii. note 5).

   [66] This visit cannot have been between May 7 and Aug. 27, when Const.
   was at CP. Nor can it well have been before May 7. We must, therefore,
   with Sievers, p. 110, put it in September. Yet see Gwatkin, p. 127,
   note.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§7. The Golden Decade, 346-356.

   (1). This period is divided into two by the death of Constans in 350,
   or perhaps more exactly by the final settlement of sole power in the
   hands of Constantius on the day of Mursa, Sept. 28, 351 [67] . The
   internal condition of the Church at Alexandria, however, was not
   seriously disturbed even in the second period. From this point of view
   the entire period may be treated as one. Its opening was auspicious.
   Egypt fully participated in the profound and wonderful peace' (p. 278)
   of the Churches. The Bishops of province after province were sending in
   their letters of adhesion to the Synod of Sardica (ib. and p. 127), and
   those of Egypt signed to a man.

   The public rejoicing of the Alexandrian Church had something of the
   character of a mission' in modern Church life. A wave of religious
   enthusiasm passed over the whole community. How many widows and how
   many orphans, who were before hungry and naked, now through the great
   zeal of the people were no longer hungry, and went forth clothed;' in a
   word, so great was their emulation in virtue, that you would have
   thought every family and every house a Church, by reason of the
   goodness of its inmates and the prayers which were offered to God' (p.
   278). Increased strictness of life, the sanctification of home, renewed
   application to prayer, and practical charity, these were a worthy
   welcome to their long-lost pastor. But most conspicuous was the impulse
   to asceticism. Marriages were renounced and even dissolved in favour of
   the monastic life; the same instincts were at work (but in greater
   intensity) as had asserted themselves at the close of the era of the
   pagan persecutions (p. 200, Â§4, fin.). Our knowledge of the history of
   the Egyptian Church under the ten years' peaceful rule of Athanasius is
   confined to a few details and to what we can infer from results.

   Strong as was the position of Athanasius in Egypt upon his return from
   exile, his hold upon the country grew with each year of the decade.
   When circumstances set Constantius free to resume the Arian campaign,
   it was against Athanasius that he worked; at first from the remote
   West, then by attempts to remove or coax him from Alexandria. But
   Athanasius was in an impregnable position, and when at last the city
   was seized by the coup de main of 356, from his hidings places in Egypt
   he was more inaccessible still, more secure in his defence, more free
   to attack. Now the extraordinary development of Egyptian Monachism must
   be placed in the first rank of the causes which strengthened Athanasius
   in Egypt. The institution was already firmly rooted there (cf. p. 190),
   and Pachomius, a slightly older contemporary of Athanasius himself, had
   converted a sporadic manifestation of the ascetic impulse into an
   organised form of Community Life. Pachomius himself had died on May 9,
   346 (infr. p. lx., note 3, and p. 569, note 3: cf. Theolog.
   Literaturztg. 1890, p. 622), but Athanasius was welcomed soon after his
   arrival by a deputation from the Society of Tabenne, who also conveyed
   a special message from the aged Antony. Athanasius placed himself at
   the head of the monastic movement, and we cannot doubt that while he
   won the enthusiastic devotion of these dogged and ardent Copts, his
   influence on the movement tended to restrain extravagances and to
   correct the morbid exaltation of the monastic ideal. It is remarkable
   that the only letters which survive from this decade (pp. 556-560) are
   to monks, and that they both support what has just been said. The army
   of Egyptian monks was destined to become a too powerful weapon, a
   scandal and a danger to the Church: but the monks were the main secret
   of the power and ubiquitous activity of Athanasius in his third exile,
   and that power was above all built up during the golden decade.

   Coupled with the growth of monachism is the transformation of the
   episcopate. The great power enjoyed by the Archbishop of Alexandria
   made it a matter of course that in a prolonged episcopate discordant
   elements would gradually vanish and unanimity increase. This was the
   case under Athanasius: but the unanimity reflected in the letter ad
   Afros had practically already come about in the year of the return of
   Ath. from Aquileia, when nearly every bishop in Egypt signed the
   Sardican letter (p. 127; the names include the new bishops of 346-7 in
   Letter 19, with one or two exceptions). Athanasius not infrequently
   (pp. 559 sq. and Vit. Pach. 72) filled up vacancies in the episcopate
   from among the monks, and Serapion of Thmuis, his most trusted
   suffragan, remained after his elevation in very close relation with the
   monasteries.

   Athanasius consecrated bishops not only for Egypt, but for the remote
   Abyssinian kingdom of Auxume as well. The visit of Frumentius to
   Alexandria, and his consecration as bishop for Auxume, are referred by
   Rufinus i. 9 (Socr. i. 19, &c.) to the beginning of the episcopate of
   Athanasius. But the chronology of the story (Gwatkin, pp. 93 sqq.,
   D.C.B. ii. 236 where the argument is faulty) forbids this altogether,
   while the letter of Constantius (p. 250) is most natural if the
   consecration of Frumentius were then a comparatively recent matter,
   scarcely intelligible if it had taken place before the deposition' of
   Athan. by the council of Tyre. Athanasius had found Egypt distracted by
   religious dissensions; but by the time of the third exile we hear very
   little of Arians excepting in Alexandria itself (see p. 564); the
   Arians' of the rest of Egypt were the remnant of the Meletians, whose
   monks are still mentioned by Theodoret (cf. p. 299 sq.). An incident
   which shews the growing numbers of the Alexandrian Church during this
   period is the necessity which arose at Easter in one year of using the
   unfinished Church of the CÃ¦sareum (for its history cf. p. 243, note 6,
   and Hist. Aceph. vi., Fest. Ind. xxxvii., xxxviii., xl.) owing to the
   vast crowds of worshippers. The Church was a gift of Constantius, and
   had been begun by Gregory, and its use before completion and dedication
   was treated by the Arians as an act of presumption and disrespect on
   the part of Athanasius.

   (2.) But while all was so happy in Egypt, the profound peace' of the
   rest of the Church was more apparent than real. The temporary revulsion
   of feeling on the part of Constantius, the engrossing urgency of the
   Persian war, the readiness of Constans to use his formidable power to
   secure justice to the Nicene bishops in the East, all these were causes
   which compelled peace, while leaving the deeper elements of strife to
   smoulder untouched. The rival depositions and anathemas of the hostile
   Councils remained without effect. Valens was in possession at Mursa,
   Photinus at Sirmium. Marcellus was, probably, not at Ancyra (Zahn 82);
   but the Arians deposed at Sardica were all undisturbed, while
   Athanasius was more firmly established than ever at Alexandria. On the
   whole, the Episcopate of the East was entirely in the hands of the
   reaction--the Nicene element, often large, among the laity was in many
   cases conciliated with difficulty. This is conspicuously the case at
   Antioch, where the temporising policy of Leontius managed to retain in
   communion a powerful body of orthodox Christians, headed by Diodorus
   and Flavian, whose energy neutralised the effect of his own steadily
   Arian policy (particulars, Gwatkin, pp. 133, sqq., Newman, Arians^4, p.
   455--from Thdt. H. E. ii. 24). The Eustathian schism at Antioch was,
   apparently, paralleled by a Marcellian schism at Ancyra, but such cases
   were decidedly the exception.

   Of the mass of instances where the bishops were not Arian but simply
   conservative, the Church of Jerusalem is the type. We have the
   instructions given to the Catechumens of this city between 348 and 350
   by Cyril, who in the latter year (Hort, p. 92) became bishop, and whose
   career is typical of the rise and development of so-called
   semi-Arianism. Cyril, like the conservatives generally, is strongly
   under the influence of Origen (see Caspari iv. 146-162, and of. the
   Catechesis in Heurtley de Fid. et Symb. 62 with the Regula Fidei in
   Orig. de Princ. i.). The instructions insist strongly on the necessity
   of scriptural language, and while contradicting the doctrines of Arius
   (without mentioning his name; cf. Athanasius on Marcellus and Photinus
   in pp. 433-447) Cyril tacitly protests against the homoousion as of
   human contrivance (Cat. v. 12), and uses in preference the words like
   to the Father according to the Scriptures' or in all things.' This
   language is that of Athanasius also, especially in his earlier works
   (pp. 84 sqq.), but in the latter phase of the controversy, especially
   in the Dated Creed of 359, which presents striking resemblances to
   Cyril's Catecheses, it became the watchword of the party of reaction.
   The Church of Jerusalem then was orthodox substantially, but rejected
   the Nicene formula, and this was the case in the East generally, except
   where the bishops were positively Arian. All were aggrieved at the way
   in which the Eastern councils had been treated by the West, and smarted
   under a sense of defeat (cf. Bright, Introd. to Hist. Tr., p. xviii.).

   Accordingly the murder of Constans in 350 was the harbinger of renewed
   religious discord. For a time the political future was doubtful.
   Magnentius, knowing what Athanasius had to fear from Constantius, made
   a bid for the support of Egypt. Clementius and Valens, two members of a
   deputation to Constantius, came round by way of Egypt to ascertain the
   disposition of the country, and especially of its Bishop. Athanasius
   received them with bitter lamentations for Constans, and, fearing the
   possibility of an invasion by Magnentius, he called upon his
   congregation to pray for the Eastern Emperor. The response was
   immediate and unanimous: O Christ, send help to Constantius' (p. 242).
   The Emperor had, in fact, sought to secure the fidelity of Athanasius
   by a letter (pp. 247, 278), assuring him of his continued support. And
   until the defeat of Magnentius at Mursa, he kept his word. That
   victory, which was as decisive for Valens as it was for Constantius
   (Gibbon, ii. 381, iii. 66, ed. Smith), was followed up by a Council at
   Sirmium, which successfully ousted the too popular Photinus (cf. pp.
   280, 298; on the appeal of Photinus, and the debate between him and
   Basil of Ancyra, apparently in 355, see Gwatkin, pp. 145 sq., note 6).
   This was made the occasion for a new onslaught upon Marcellus in the
   anathemas appended to a reissue of the fourth Antiochene' or
   Philippopolitan Creed (p. 465; on the tentative character of these
   anathemas as a polemical move, cf. Gwatkin, p. 147, note 1). The
   Emperor was occupied for more than a year with the final suppression of
   Magnentius (Aug. 10, 353), but the first Winter after his victory,
   which he spent at Arles, was employed against an enemy more odious to
   him than the vanquished tyrant of Gaul' (Gibbon).

   It is unnecessary to detail the tedious and unedifying story of the
   councils of Arles and Milan. The former was a provincial council of
   Gaul, attended by legates of the Roman see. All present submissively
   registered the imperial condemnation of Athanasius. The latter, delayed
   till 355 by the Rhenish campaign of Constantius, was due to the request
   of Liberius, who desired to undo the evil work of his legates, and to
   the desire of the Emperor to follow up the verdict of a provincial with
   that of a more representative Synod. The number of bishops present was
   probably very small (the numbers in Socrates ii. 36, Soz. iv. 9, may
   refer to those who afterwards signed under compulsion, p. 280, cf. the
   case of Sardica, p. 127, note 10). The proceedings were a drama in
   three acts, first, submission, the legates protesting; secondly, stormy
   protest, after the arrival of Eusebius of VercellÃ¦; thirdly, open
   coercion. The deposition of Athanasius was proffered to each bishop for
   signature, and, if he refused, a sentence of banishment was at once
   pronounced, the emperor sitting with the velum' drawn, much as though
   an English judge were to assume the black cap at the beginning of a
   capital trial. He cut short argument by announcing that he was for the
   prosecution,' and remonstrance by the sentence of exile (p. 299); the
   hoper ego boulomai touto kanon put into his mouth by Athanasius (p.
   281) represents at any rate the spirit of his proceedings as justly as
   does la tradizione son' io' that of the autocrat of a more recent
   council. At this council no creed was put forth: until the enemy was
   dislodged from Alexandria the next step would be premature. But a band
   of exiles were sent in strict custody to the East, of some of whom we
   shall hear later on (pp. 561, 481, 281, cf. p. 256, and the excellent
   monograph of KrÃ¼ger, Lucifer von Calaris, pp. 9-23).

   Meanwhile, Athanasius had been peacefully pursuing his diocesan duties,
   but not without a careful outlook as the clouds gathered on the
   horizon. The prospect of a revival of the charges against him moved him
   to set in order an unanswerable array of documents, in proof, firstly
   of the unanimity, secondly of the good reason, with which he had been
   acquitted of them (see p. 97). He had also, in view of revived
   assertions of Arianism, drawn up the two letters or memoranda on the
   rationale of the Nicene formula and on the opinion ascribed to his
   famous predecessor, Dionysius (the Apology was probably written about
   351, the date of the de Decr., and de Sent. Dion. [68] falls a little
   later). In 353 he began to apprehend danger, from the hopes with which
   the establishment of Constantius in the sole possession of the Empire
   was inspiring his enemies, headed by Valens in the West, and Acacius of
   CÃ¦sarea in the East. Accordingly, he despatched a powerful deputation
   to Constantius, who was then at Milan, headed by Serapion, his most
   trusted suffragan (cf. p. 560, note 3a; p. 497, Â§3, copied by Soz. iv.
   9; Fest. Ind. xxv.). The legates sailed May 19, but on the 23rd
   Montanus, an officer of the Palace, arrived with an Imperial letter,
   declining to receive any legates, but granting an alleged request of
   Athanasius to be allowed to come to Italy (p. 245 sq.). As he had made
   no request of the kind, Athanasius naturally suspected a plot to entice
   him away from his stronghold. The letter of Constantius did not convey
   an absolute command, so Athanasius, protesting his willingness to come
   when ordered to do so, resolved to remain where he was for the present.
   All the people were exceedingly troubled,' according to our
   chroniclers. In this year Montanus was sent against the bishop, but a
   tumult having been excited, he retired without effect.' Two years and
   two months later, i.e., in July-Aug. 355 (p. 497), force was attempted
   instead of stratagem, which the proceedings of Arles had, of course,
   made useless. In this year Diogenes, the Secretary of the Emperor, came
   with the intention of seizing the bishop,' and Diogenes pressed hard
   upon all, trying to dislodge the bishop from the city, and he afflicted
   all pretty severely; but on Sept. 4 [69] he pressed sharply, and
   stormed a Church, and this he did continually for four months...until
   Dec. 23. But as the people and magistrates vehemently withstood
   Diogenes, he returned back without effect on the 23rd of December
   aforesaid' (Fest. Ind. xxvii., Hist. Aceph. iii.). The fatal blow was
   clearly imminent. By this time the exiles had begun to arrive in the
   East, and rumours came [70] that not even the powerful and popular
   Liberius, not even Father' Hosius himself, had been spared. Athanasius
   might well point out to Dracontius (p. 558) that in declining the
   bishopric of the country district of Alexandria' he was avoiding the
   post of danger. On the sixth of January the Duke' Syrianus arrived in
   Alexandria, concentrating in the city drafts from all the legions
   stationed in Egypt and Libya. Rumour was active as to the intentions of
   the commandant, and Athanasius felt justified in asking him whether he
   came with any orders from the Court. Syrianus replied that he did not,
   and Athanasius then produced the letter of Constantius referred to
   above (written 350-351). The magistrates and people joined in the
   remonstrance, and at last Syrianus protested by the life of CÃ¦sar' that
   he would remain quiet until the matter had been referred to the
   Emperor. This restored confidence, and on Thursday night, Feb. 8,
   Athanasius was presiding at a crowded service of preparation for a
   Communion on the following morning (Friday after Septuagesima) in the
   Church of Theonas, which with the exception of the unfinished CÃ¦sareum
   was the largest in the city (p. 243). Suddenly the church was
   surrounded and the doors broken in, and just after midnight Syrianus
   and the notary' Hilary entered with an infinite force of soldiers.'
   Athanasius (his fullest account is p. 263) calmly took his seat upon
   the throne (in the recess of the apse), and ordered the deacon to begin
   the 136th psalm, the people responding at each verse for His mercy
   endureth for ever.' Meanwhile the soldiers crowded up to the chancel,
   and in spite of entreaties the bishop refused to escape until the
   congregation were in safety. He ordered the prayers to proceed, and
   only at the last moment a crowd of monks and clergy seized the
   Archbishop and managed to convey him in the confusion out of the church
   in a half-fainting state (protest of Alexandrians, p. 301), but
   thankful that he had been able to secure the escape of his people
   before his own (p. 264). From that moment Athanasius was lost to public
   view for six years and fourteen days' (Hist. Aceph., i.e., Mechir 13,
   356-Mechir 27, 362), for he remembered that which was written, Hide
   thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be
   overpast (pp. 288, 252, 262). Constantius and the Arians had planned
   their blow with skill and delivered it with decisive effect. But they
   had won a Cadmean Victory.'

   Â§8. The Third Exile, 356-362.

   The third exile of Athanasius marks the summit of his achievement. Its
   commencement is the triumph, its conclusion the collapse of Arianism.
   It is true that after the death of Constantius the battle went on with
   variations of fortune for twenty years, mostly under the reign of an
   ardently Arian Emperor (364-378). But by 362 the utter lack of inner
   coherence in the Arian ranks was manifest to all; the issue of the
   fight might be postponed by circumstances but could not be in doubt.
   The break-up of the Arian power was due to its own lack of reality: as
   soon as it had a free hand, it began to go to pieces. But the watchful
   eye of Athanasius followed each step in the process from his
   hiding-place, and the event was greatly due to his powerful personality
   and ready pen, knowing whom to overwhelm and whom to conciliate, where
   to strike and where to spare. This period then of forced abstention
   from affairs was the most stirring in spiritual and literary activity
   in the whole life of Athanasius. It produced more than half of the
   treatises which fill this volume, and more than half of his entire
   extant works. With this we shall have to deal presently; but let it be
   noted once for all how completely the amazing power wielded by the
   wandering fugitive was based upon the devoted fidelity of Egypt to its
   pastor. Towns and villages, deserts and monasteries, the very tombs
   were scoured by the Imperial inquisitors in the search for Athanasius;
   but all in vain; not once do we hear of any suspicion of betrayal. The
   work of the golden decade was bearing its fruit.

   (1.) On leaving the church of Theonas, Athanasius appears to have made
   his escape from the city. If for once we may hazard a conjecture, the
   numerous cells of the Nitrian desert offered a not too distant but
   fairly inpenetrable refuge. He must at any rate have selected a place
   where he could gain time to reflect on the situation, and above all
   ensure that he should be kept well informed of events from time to
   time. For in Athanasius we never see the panic-stricken outlaw; he is
   always the general meditating his next movement and full of the
   prospects of his cause. He made up his mind to appeal to Constantius in
   person. He could not believe that an Emperor would go back upon his
   solemn pledges, especially such a voluntary assurance as he had
   received after the death of Constans. Accordingly he drew up a
   carefully elaborated defence (Ap. Const. 1-26) dealing with the four
   principal charges against him, and set off through the Libyan [71]
   desert with the intention of crossing to Italy and finding Constantius
   at Milan. But while he was on his way, he encountered rumours
   confirming the reports of the wholesale banishment not only of the
   recalcitrants of Milan, but of Liberius of Rome and the great Hosius of
   Spain. Next came the news of the severe measures against Egyptian
   bishops, and of the banishment of sixteen of their number, coupled with
   the violence practised by the troops at Alexandria on Easter Day (p.
   248 sq.); however, his journey was continued, until he received copies
   of letters from the Emperor, one denouncing him to the Alexandrians and
   recommending a new bishop, one George, as their future guide, the other
   summoning the princes of Auxumis to send Frumentius (supr. p. xlviii.)
   to Egypt in order that he might unlearn what he had been taught by the
   most wicked Athanasius' and receive instruction from the venerable
   George.' These letters, which shew how completely the pursuers were off
   the scent (p. 249), convinced Athanasius that a personal interview was
   out of the question. He returned into the desert,' and at leisure
   completed his apology (pp. 249-253), with the view partly of possible
   future delivery, partly no doubt of literary circulation. Before
   turning back, however, he appears to have drawn up his letter to the
   bishops of Egypt and Libya, warning them against the formula (see p.
   222) which was being tendered for their subscription, and encouraging
   them to endure persecution, which had already begun at least in Libya
   (Ep. Ã†g.); the designation of George (Â§7) was already known, but he had
   not arrived, nor had Secundus (19) reappeared in Egypt, at any rate not
   in Libya (he was there in Lent, 357, p. 294). The letter to the
   bishops, then, must have been written about Easter, 356; not long
   after, because it contains no details of the persecution in Egypt; not
   before, for the persecution had already begun, and Athanasius was
   already in Cyrenaica, whence he turned back not earlier than April (to
   allow time for Constantius (1) to hear that Athanasius was thought to
   have fled to Ethiopia, (2) to write to Egypt, (3) for copies of the
   letter to overtake Athanasius on his way to Italy. Constantius was at
   Milan Jan.-April).

   Meanwhile in Alexandria disorders had continued. The duke' appears to
   have been either unable for a time, or to have thought it needless, to
   take possession of the churches; but we hear of a violent dispersion of
   worshippers from the neighbourhood of the cemetery on Easter Day (p.
   249, cf. the Virgins after Syrianus but before Heraclius, p. 288);
   while throughout Egypt subscription to an Arianising formula was being
   enforced on the bishops under pain of expulsion. After Easter, a change
   of governor took place, Maximus of NicÃ¦a (pp. 301 sqq., 247) being
   succeeded by Cataphronius, who reached Alexandria on the 10th of June
   (Hist. Aceph. iv.). He was accompanied by a Count Heraclius, who
   brought a letter from Constantius threatening the heathen with severe
   measures (pp. 288, 290), unless active hostilities against the
   Athanasian party were begun (this letter was not the one given p. 249;
   Ath. rightly remarks it reflected great discredit upon the writer').
   Heraclius announced that by Imperial order the Churches were to be
   given up to the Arians, and compelled all the magistrates, including
   the functionaries of heathen temples, to sign an undertaking to execute
   the Imperial incitements to persecution, and to agree to receive as
   Bishop the Emperor's nominee. These incredible precautions shew the
   general esteem for Athanasius even outside the Church, and the
   misgivings felt at Court as to the reception of the new bishop. The
   Gentiles reluctantly agreed, and the next acts of violence were carried
   out with their aid, or rather with that of the more abandoned among
   them' (p. 291). On the fourth day from the arrival of Cataphronius,
   that is in the early hours of Thursday, June 13, after a service (which
   had began overnight, pp. 290, 256 fin., Hist. Aceph. v.), just as all
   the congregation except a few women had left, the church of Theonas was
   stormed and violences perpetrated which left far behind anything that
   Syrianus had done. Women were murdered, the church wrecked and polluted
   with the very worst orgies of heathenism, houses and even tombs were
   ransacked throughout the city and suburbs on pretence of seeking for
   Athanasius.' Sebastian the Manichee, who about this time succeeded to
   the military command of Syrianus, appears to have carried on these
   outrages with the utmost zest (yet see Hist. Ar. 60). Many more bishops
   were driven into exile (compare the twenty-six of p. 297 with the
   sixteen' p. 248, but some may belong to a still later period, see p.
   257), and the Arian bishops and clergy installed, including the
   bitterly vindictive Secundus in Libya (p. 257). The formal transfer of
   churches at Alexandria took place on Saturday, June 15 (infr., p. 290,
   note 9): the anniversary of Eutychius (p. 292) was kept at Alexandria
   on July 11, (Martyrol. Vetust. Ed. 1668). After a further delay of
   eight months and eleven days' George, the new bishop, made his
   appearance (Feb. 24, 357 [72] , third Friday in Lent). His previous
   career [73] and character [74] were strange qualifications for the
   second bishopric in Christendom. He had been a pork-contractor at
   Constantinople, and according to his many enemies a fraudulent one; he
   had amassed considerable wealth, and was a zealous Arian. His violent
   temper perhaps recommended him as a man likely to crush the opposition
   that was expected. The history of his episcopate may be briefly
   disposed of here. He entered upon his See in Lent, 357, with an armed
   force. At Easter he renewed the violent persecution of bishops, clergy,
   virgins, and lay people. In the week after Pentecost he let loose the
   cruel commandant Sebastian against a number of persons who were
   worshipping at the cemetery instead of communicating with himself; many
   were killed, and many more banished. The expulsion of bishops (over
   thirty,' p. 257, cf. other reff. above) was continued (the various data
   of Ath. are not easy to reconcile, the first 16 of p. 257 may be the
   sixteen' of p. 248, before Easter, 356: we miss the name of Serapion in
   all the lists!) Theodore, Bishop of Oxyrynchus, the largest town of
   middle Egypt, upon submitting to George, was compelled by him to submit
   to reordination. The people refused to have anything more to do with
   him, and did without a bishop for a long time, until they obtained a
   pastor in one Heraclides, who is said to have become a Luciferian.'
   (Cf. Lib. Prec., and Le Quien ii. p. 578.) George carried on his
   tyranny eighteen months, till Aug. 29, 358. His fierce insults against
   Pagan worship were accompanied by the meanest and most oppressive
   rapacity. At last the populace, exasperated by his adder's bites'
   (Ammian.), attacked him, and he was rescued with difficulty. On Oct. 2
   he left the town, and the party of Athanasius expelled his followers
   from the churches on Oct. 11, but on Dec. 24, Sebastian came in from
   the country and restored the churches to the people of George. On June
   23, 359, the notary Paul' (in complicandis calumniarum nexibus artifex
   dirus, unde ei CatenÃ¦ inditum est cognomentum,' Ammian. Marc. XIV. v.,
   XV. iii.), the Jeffreys of the day, held a commission of blood, and
   vindictively punished many [75] .' George was at this time busy with
   the councils of Seleucia and Constantinople (he was not actually
   present at the latter, Thdt. H. E. ii. 28), and was in no hurry to
   return. At last, just after the death of Constantius, he ventured back,
   Nov. 26, 361, but on the proclamation of Julian on Nov. 30 was seized
   by the populace and thrown into chains; on Dec. 24, impatient of the
   tedious forms of judicial proceedings,' the people dragged him from
   prison and lynched him with the utmost ignominy.

   Athanasius meanwhile eluded all search. During part of the year 357-358
   he was in concealment in Alexandria itself, and he was supposed to be
   there two years later (Fest. Ind. xxx., xxxii.; the latter gives some
   colour to the tale of Palladius--cf. Soz. v. 6--of his having during
   part of this period remained concealed in the house of a Virgin of the
   church), but the greater part of his time was undoubtedly spent in the
   numberless cells of Upper and Lower Egypt, where he was secure of close
   concealment, and of loyal and efficient messengers to warn him of
   danger, keep him informed of events, and carry his letters and writings
   far and wide. The tale of Rufinus (i. 18) that he lay hid all the six
   years in a dry cistern is probably a confused version of this general
   fact. The tombs of kings and private persons were at this time the
   common abode of monks (cf. p. 564, note 1; also Socr. iv. 13, a similar
   mistake). Probably we must place the composition of the Life of Antony,
   the great classic of Monasticism, at some date during this exile,
   although the question is surrounded with difficulties (see pp. 188
   sqq.). The importance of the period, however, lies in the march of
   events outside Egypt. (For a brilliant sketch of the desert life of
   Athanasius see D.C.B. i. 194 sq.; also Bright, Hist. Treatises, p.
   lxxiv. sq.)

   (2.) With the accession of Constantius to sole power, the anti-Nicene
   reaction at last had a free hand throughout the Empire. Of what
   elements did it now consist? The original reaction was conservative in
   its numerical strength, Arian in its motive power. The stream was
   derived from the two fountain heads of Paul of Samosata, the ancestor
   of Arius, and of Origen the founder of the theology of the Eastern
   Church generally and especially of that of Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea. Flowing
   from such heterogeneous sources, the two currents never thoroughly
   mingled. Common action, dictated on the one hand by dread of
   Sabellianism, manipulated on the other hand by wire-pullers in the
   interest of Arianism, united the East till after the death of
   Constantine in the campaign against the leaders of NicÃ¦a. Then for the
   last ten years of the life of Constans, Arianism, or rather the
   Reaction, had its stationary period' (Newman). The chaos of creeds at
   the Council of Antioch (supr. p. xliv.) shewed the presence of
   discordant aims; but opposition to Western interference, and the urgent
   panic of Photinus and his master, kept them together: the lead was
   still taken by the Arianisers, as is shewn by the continued prominence
   of the fourth Antiochene Creed at Philippopolis (343), Antioch (344),
   and Sirmium (351). But the second or Lucianic Creed was on record as
   the protest of the conservative majority, and was not forgotten. Yet
   until after 351, when Photinus was finally got rid of and Constantius
   master of the world, the reaction was still embodied in a fairly
   compact and united party. But now the latent heterogeneity of the
   reaction began to make itself felt. Differing in source and motive, the
   two main currents made in different directions. The influence of
   Aristotle and Paul and Lucian set steadily toward a harder and more
   consistent Arianism, that of Plato and the Origenists toward an
   understanding with the Nicenes.

   (a.) The original Arians, now gradually dying out, were all tainted
   with compromise and political subserviency. Arius, Asterius, Eusebius
   of Nicomedia, and the rest (Secundus and Theonas are the solitary
   exception), were all at one time or another, and in different degrees,
   willing to make concessions and veil their more objectionable tenets
   under some evasive confession. But in many cases temporary humiliation
   produced its natural result in subsequent uncompromising defiance. This
   is exemplified in the history of Valens and Ursacius after 351. Valens,
   especially, figures as the head of a new party of Anomoeans' or
   ultra-Arians. The rise of this party is associated with the name of
   Aetius, its after-history with that of his pupil Eunomius, bishop of
   Cyzicus from 361. It was marked by a genuine scorn for the compromises
   of earlier Arianism, from which it differed in nothing except its more
   resolute sincerity. The career of Aetius (D.C.B. i. 50, sqq.) was that
   of a struggling, self-made, self-confident man. A pupil of the
   Lucianists (supr., p. xxviii.), he shrunk from none of the irreverent
   conclusions of Arianism. His loud voice and clear-cut logic lost none
   of their effect by fear of offending the religious sensibilities of
   others. In 350 Leontius ordained him deacon, with a licence to preach,
   at Antioch; but Flavian and Diodorus (see above, Â§7) raised such a
   storm that the cautious bishop felt obliged to suspend him. On the
   appointment of George he was invited to Alexandria, whither Eunomius
   was attracted by his fame as a teacher. His influence gradually spread,
   and he found many kindred spirits among the bishops. The survivors of
   the original Arians were with him at heart, as also were men like
   Eudoxius, bishop of Germanicia (of Antioch, 358, of CP. 360), who fell
   as far behind Aetius in sincerity as he surpassed him in profanity; the
   Anomoeans (anomoios) were numerically strong, and morally even more so;
   they were the wedge which eventually broke up the reactionary mass,
   rousing the sincere horror of the Conservatives, commanding the
   sometimes dissembled but always real sympathy of the true Arians, and
   seriously embarrassing the political Arians, whose one aim was to keep
   their party together by disguising differences of principle under some
   convenient phrase.

   (b.) This latter party were headed by Acacius in the East and in the
   West by Valens, who while in reality, as stated above, making play for
   the Anomoean cause, was diplomatist enough to use the influential party
   of no principle' as his instrument for the purpose. Valens during the
   whole period of the sole reign of Constantius (and in fact until his
   own death about 375) was the heart and soul of the new and last phase
   of Arianism, namely of the formal attempt to impose an Arian creed upon
   the Church in lieu of that of NicÃ¦a. But this could only be done by
   skilful use of less extreme men, and in the trickery and statecraft
   necessary for such a purpose Valens was facile princeps. His main
   supporter in the East was Acacius, who had succeeded to the bishoprick,
   the library, and the doctrinal position of his preceptor Eusebius of
   CÃ¦sarea. The latter, as we saw (p. xxvii. note 5), represented the
   extreme left' of the conservative reaction, meeting the right wing, or
   rather the extreme concessions, of pure Arianism as represented by its
   official advocate Asterius, whom in fact Eusebius had defended against
   the onslaught of Marcellus. In so far then as the stream of pure
   Arianism could be mingled with the waters of Conservatism, Acacius was
   the channel in which they joined. Eusebius had not been an Arian,
   neither was Acacius; Eusebius had theological convictions, but lacked
   clearness of perception, Acacius was a clear-headed man but without
   convictions; Eusebius was substantially conservative in his theology,
   but tainted with political Arianism; Acacius was a political Arian
   first, and anything you please afterwards. On the whole, his sympathies
   seem to have been conservative, but he manifests a rooted dislike of
   principle of any kind. He appoints orthodox bishops (Philost. v. 1),
   but quarrels with them as soon as he encounters their true mettle,
   Cyril in 358, Meletius in 361; he befriends Arians, but betrays the too
   honest Aetius in 360. His ecclesiastical career begins with the council
   of four creeds in 341; in controversy with Marcellus he developed the
   concessions of Asterius till he almost reached the Nicene standard; he
   hailed effusively the Anomoean Creed of Valens in 358 (Soz. iv. 12),
   and in 359-60 forced that of Nike in its amended form upon the Eastern
   Church far and wide. He is next heard of, signing the Omoousion, in
   363, and lastly (Socr. iv. 2) under Valens is named again along with
   Eudoxius. The real opinions of a man with such a record are naturally
   not easy to determine, but we may be sure that he was in thorough
   sympathy with the policy of Constantius, namely the union of all
   parties in the Church on the basis of subserviency to the State.

   The difficulty was to find a formula. The test of NicÃ¦a could not be
   superseded without putting something in its place, which should include
   Arianism as effectually as the other had excluded it. Such a test was
   eventually (after 357) found in the word homoios [76] . It was a word
   with a good Catholic history. We find it used freely by Athanasius in
   his earlier anti-Arian writings, and it was thoroughly current in
   conservative theology, as for example in Cyril's Catecheses (he has
   homoion kata tas graphas and homoion kata panta). It would therefore
   permit even the full Nicene belief. On the other hand many of the more
   earnest conservative theologians had begun to reflect on what was
   involved in the likeness' of the Son to the Father, and had formulated
   the conviction that this likeness was essential, not, as the Arians
   held, acquired. This was in fact a fair inference from the ousias
   aparallakton eikona of the Dedication Creed. This question made an
   agreement between men like Valens and Basil difficult, but it could be
   evaded by keeping to the simple homoion, and deprecating non-scriptural
   precision. Lastly, there were the Anomoeans to be considered. Now the
   homoion had the specious appearance of flatly contradicting this
   repellent avowal of the extremists; but to Valens and his friends it
   had the substantial recommendation of admitting it in reality.
   Likeness' is a relative term. If two things are only like' they are
   ipso facto to some extent unlike; the two words are not contradictories
   but correlatives, and if the likeness is not essential, the unlikeness
   is. So far then as the Homoean' party rested on any doctrinal principle
   at all, that principle was the principle of Arius; and that is how
   Valens forwarded the Anomoean cause by putting himself at the head of
   the Homoeans. His plan of campaign had steadily matured. The deposition
   of Photinus in 351 had sounded the note of war, Arles and Milan (353-5)
   and the expulsion of Athanasius (356) had cleared the field of
   opponents, George was now in possession at Alexandria, and in the
   summer of 357 the triumph of Arianism was proclaimed. A small council
   of bishops met at Sirmium and published a Latin Creed, insisting
   strongly (1) on the unique Godhead of the Father, (2) on the subjection
   of the Son along with all things subjected to Him by the Father,' and
   (3) strictly proscribing the terms homoousion, homoiousion, and all
   discussion of ousia, as unscriptural and inscrutable.

   This manifesto was none the less Anomoean for not explicitly avowing
   the obnoxious phrase. It forbids the definition of the likeness' as
   essential, and does not even condescend to use the homoion at all. The
   Nicene definition is for the first time overtly and bluntly denounced,
   and the conservatives' are commanded to hold their peace. The Sirmium
   blasphemy' was indeed a trumpet-blast of defiance. The echo came back
   from the Homoeans assembled at Antioch, whence Eudoxius the new bishop,
   Acacius, and their friends addressed the Pannonians with a letter of
   thanks. But the blast heralded the collapse of the Arian cause; the
   Reaction fell to pieces the moment Arianism ventured to have a policy
   of its own' (Gwatkin, p. 158, the whole account should be consulted).
   Not only did orthodox Gaul, under Phoebadius of Agen, the most stalwart
   of the lesser men whom Milan had spared, meet in synod and condemn the
   blasphemy, but the conservative East was up in arms against Arianism,
   for the first time with thorough spontaneity. Times were changed
   indeed; the East was at war with the West, but on the side of orthodoxy
   against Arianism.

   (c) We must now take account of the party headed by Basil of Ancyra and
   usually (since Epiphanius), but with some injustice, designated as
   Semi-Arians. Their theological ancestry and antecedents have been
   already sketched (pp. xxvii., xxxv.); they are the representatives of
   that conservatism, moulded by the neo-Asiatic, or modified Origenist
   tradition, which warmly condemned Arianism at NicÃ¦a, but acquiesced
   with only half a heart in the test by which the Council resolved to
   exclude it. They furnished the numerical strength, the material basis
   so to call it, of the anti-Nicene reaction; but the reaction on their
   part had not been Arian in principle, but in part anti-Sabellian, in
   part the empirical conservatism of men whose own principles are vague
   and ill-assorted, and who fail to follow the keener sight which
   distinguishes the higher conservatism from the lower. They lent
   themselves to the purposes of the Eusebians (a name which ought to be
   dropped after 342) on purely negative grounds and in view of questions
   of personal rights and accusations. A positive doctrinal formula they
   did not possess. But in the course of years reflexion did its work. A
   younger generation grew up who had not been taught to respect NicÃ¦a,
   nor yet had imbibed Arian principles. Cyril at Jerusalem, Meletius at
   Antioch, are specimens of a large class. The Dedication Creed at
   Antioch represents an early stage in the growth of this body of
   conviction, conviction not absolutely uniform everywhere, as the result
   shews, but still with a distinct tendency to settle down to a formal
   position with regard to the great question of the age. There was
   nothing in the Nicene doctrine that men like this did not hold: but the
   word homoousion opened the door to the dreaded Sabellian error: was not
   the history of Marcellus and Photinus a significant comment upon it?
   But if ousia meant not individuality, but specific identity (supr., p.
   xxxi. sq.) even this term might be innocently admitted. But to make
   that meaning plain, what was more effective than the insertion of an
   iota? Omoiousios, then, was the satisfactory test which would banish
   Arius and Marcellus alike. Who first used the word for the purpose, we
   do not know, but its first occurrence is its prohibition in the
   blasphemy' of Valens in 357. The leader of the semi-Arians' in 357 was
   Basil of Ancyra, a man of deep learning and high character. George of
   Laodicea, an original Arian, was in active but short-lived [77]
   alliance with the party, other prominent members of it were Eustathius,
   Bishop of Sebaste (Sivas), Eleusius of Cyzicus, Macedonius of
   Constantinople, Eusebius of Emesa, Cyril of Jerusalem, and Mark of
   Arethusa, a high-minded but violent man, who represents the left' wing
   of the party as Cyril and Basil represent the right.'

   Now the trumpet-blast' of Valens gave birth to the Semi-Arians' as a
   formal party. An attempt was made to reunite the reaction on a Homoean
   basis in 359, but the events of that year made the breach more open
   than ever. The tendency towards the Nicene position which received its
   impulse in 357 continued unchecked until the Nicene cause triumphed in
   Asia in the hands of the conservatives' of the next generation.

   Immediately after the Acacian Synod at Antioch early in 358, George of
   Laodicea, who had reasons of his own for indignation against Eudoxius,
   wrote off in hot haste to warn Basil of the fearful encouragement that
   was being given to the doctrines of Aetius in that city. Basil, who was
   in communication (through Hilary) with Phoebadius and his colleagues,
   had invited twelve neighbouring bishops to the dedication of a church
   in Ancyra at this time, and took the opportunity of drawing up a
   synodical letter insisting on the Essential Likeness of the Son to the
   Father (homoion kat' ousian), and eighteen anathemas directed against
   Marcellus and the Anomoeans. (The censure of homoousion e tautoousion
   is against the Marcellian sense of the homoousion). Basil, Eustathius,
   and Eleusius then proceeded to the Court at Sirmium and were successful
   in gaining the ear of the Emperor, who at this time had a high regard
   for Basil, and apparently obtained the ratification by a council, at
   which Valens, &c., were present, of a composite formula of their own
   (Newman's semi-Arian digest of three Confessions') which was also
   signed by Liberius, who was thereupon sent back to Rome. (Soz. iv. 15
   is our only authority here, and his account of the formula is not very
   clear: he seems to mean that two, not three, confessions were combined.
   (Cf. p. 449, note 4.) On the whole, it is most probable that the
   fourth' Antiochene formula in its Sirmian recension of 351 is intended,
   perhaps with the addition of twelve of the Ancyrene anathemas. (The
   question of the signatures of Liberius need not detain us.) The party
   of Valens were involved in sudden and unlooked-for discomfiture. Basil
   even succeeded in obtaining a decree of banishment against Eudoxius,
   Aetius, and seventy' others (Philost. iv. 8). But an Arian deputation
   from Syria procured their recall, and all parties stood at bay in
   mutual bitterness.

   Now was the opportunity of Valens. He saw the capabilities of the
   Homoean compromise, as yet embodied in no creed, and resolved to try
   it: and his experiment was not unsuccessful. All parties alike seem to
   have agreed upon the necessity for a council of the whole Church (on
   the origin of the proposal, and for other details, see p. 448). But
   Valens was determined what the result of the council must be.
   Accordingly he prevailed on the Emperor to divide it, the Western Synod
   to meet at Ariminum, the Eastern at Rocky Seleucia,' a mountain
   fortress in Cilicia where there happened to be plenty of troops. The
   management of the latter was entrusted to Acacius; at Rimini Valens
   would be present in person. In event of the two synods differing, a
   delegation of ten bishops from each was to meet at Court and settle the
   matter. The Creed to be adopted had also to be arranged beforehand, and
   for this purpose, to his great discredit, Basil of Ancyra entered into
   a conference (along with Mark of Arethusa and certain colleagues) with
   Valens, George of Alexandria, and others of like mind. The result was
   the Dated Creed' (May 22, 359) drawn by Mark, prohibiting the word
   ousia (in a gentler tone than that of the creed of Valens in 357), but
   containing the definition homoion kata panta (as also the Scriptures
   teach,' see above, on Cyril, p. xlix.), words which Valens and Ursacius
   sought to suppress. But Constantius insisted on their retention, and
   Basil emphasised his subscription by a strongly-worded addition.
   Moreover in conjunction with George of Laodicea he drew up a memorandum
   (Epiph. 72, 12-22) vindicating the term ousia as implied in Scripture,
   insisting on the absolute essential likeness of the Son to the Father,
   except in respect of the Incarnation, and repudiating the idea that
   agennesia is the essential notion of Godhead. Such a protest was highly
   significant as an approach to the Nicene position, but Basil must have
   felt its inefficiency for the purpose in hand. Had the creed been
   anything but a surrender of principle on his part, no explanatory
   memoranda would have been needed.

   After the fiasco of the Dated Creed, the issue of the Councils was not
   doubtful. The details may be reserved for another place (pp. 448, 453
   sqq.), but the general result is noteworthy. At both Councils the court
   party were in a minority, and in both alike they eventually had their
   way. (See Bright, Hist. Tr. lxxxiv.-xc., and Gwatkin, 170-180.) On the
   whole the Seleucian synod came out of the affair more honourably than
   the other, as their eventual surrender was confined to their delegates.
   Both Councils began bravely. The majorities deposed their opponents and
   affirmed their own faith, the Westerns that of NicÃ¦a, the Easterns that
   of the Dedication. From both Councils deputations from each rival
   section went to the Emperor, who was now at Constantinople. The
   deputies from the majority at Ariminum, where the meeting had begun
   fully two months before the other, were not received, but detained
   first at Hadrianople, then at NikÃ© in Thrace (chosen, says Socr. ii.
   37, to impose on the world by the name), where they were induced to
   sign a recension of the Dated Creed (the Creed itself had been revoked
   and recast without the date and perhaps without the kata panta before
   the preliminary meeting at Sirmium broke up, p. 466) of a more
   distinctly Homoean character. Armed with this document Valens brought
   them back to the Council, and by threats and cajolery' obtained the
   signatures of nearly all the bishops. Yet the stalwart Phoebadius,
   Claudius of Picenum, the venerable African Muzonius, father of the
   Council, and a few others, were undaunted. But Valens, by adroit
   dissimulation and by guiding into a manageable shape the successive
   anathematisms by which his orthodoxy was tested, managed to deceive
   these simple-minded Westerns, and with applause and exultation, plausu
   quodam et tripudio' (Jer.), amidst which Valens was lauded to the
   skies' (!), the bishops were released from their wearisome detention
   and suspense. But Valens cum recessisset tunc gloriabatur' (Prov. xx.
   14). The Western bishops realised too late what they had done, Ingemuit
   totus orbis, et se Arianum esse miratus est.' Valens hurried with the
   creed and the anathemas of Phoebadius to Constantinople, where he found
   the Seleucian deputies in hot discussion at court. The Eastern bishops
   at Seleucia had held to the Lucianic' creed, and contemptuously set
   aside not only the Acacian alternative (p. 466), but the whole
   compromise of Basil and Mark at the Sirmian conference of the preceding
   May. The Conservatives' and Acacians were at open war. But the change
   of the seat of war to the court gave the latter the advantage, and
   Valens and Acacius were determined to secure their position at any
   cost. The first step was to compel the signature of the semi-Arian'
   deputies to the creed of Ariminum. This was facilitated by the renewal
   on the part of Acacius and Valens of their repudiation, already
   announced at Seleucia (p. 466), of the 'Anomoion, (of course with the
   mental reservation that the repudiation referred only to will). Even
   so, tedious discussions [78] , and the threats of Constantius, with
   whom Basil had now lost all his influence (Thdt. ii. 27), were needed
   to bring about the required compliance late at night on New Year's Eve,
   359-360 (Soz. iv. 23). In January, at the dedication of the Great
   Church of Constantine, the second step was taken. The revised creed of
   NikÃ© was reissued without the anathemas of Ariminum. Aetius was offered
   by his friend Eudoxius as a sacrifice to the Emperor's scruples (see
   the account of the previous debates in Thdt. ubi supra), much as Arius
   had been sacrificed by his fellow-Lucianists at NicÃ¦a (Â§2 supra: nine
   bishops protested, but were allowed six months to reconsider their
   objection; the six months lasted two years, and then a reconciliation
   with Aetius took place for a time, Philost. vii. 6). Next a clean sweep
   was made of the leading semi-Arians on miscellaneous charges (Soz. iv.
   24, sq.), and Eudoxius was installed as bishop of the New Rome in the
   place of Macedonius. The sacrifice of Aetius gave the Homoeans a free
   hand against their opponents, and was compensated by the appointment of
   numerous Anomoeans to vacant sees. In particular Eunomius replaced
   Eleusius at Cyzicus. In the eastern half of the Empire Homoeanism was
   supreme, and remained so politically for nearly twenty years. But not
   in the West. Before the Council of Constantinople met, the power of the
   West had passed away from Constantius. Gaul had acknowledged Julian as
   Augustus, and from Gaul came the voice of defiance for the Homoean
   leaders and sympathy for their deposed opponents (Hil. Frag. xi.). And
   even in the East, throughout their twenty years the Homoeans retained
   their hold upon the Church by a dead hand. The moral strength of
   Christendom lay elsewhere;' on the one hand the followers of Eunomius
   were breaking loose from Eudoxius and forming a definitely Arian sect,
   those of Macedonius crystallising their cruder conservatism into the
   illogical creed of the Pneumatomachi;' on the other hand the second
   generation of the semi-Arians' were, under the influence of Athanasius,
   working their way to the Greek Catholicism of the future, the
   Catholicism of the neo-Nicene school, of Basil and the two Gregories.

   The lack of inner cohesion in the Homoean ranks was exemplified at the
   start in the election of a new bishop for Antioch. Eudoxius had vacated
   the see for that of New Rome; Anianus, the nominee of the Homoeusian
   majority of Seleucia, was out of the question; accordingly at a Council
   in 361 the Acacians fixed upon Meletius, who had in the previous year
   accepted from the Homoeans of CP. the See of Sebaste in the room of the
   exiled Eustathius. The new Bishop was requested by the Emperor to
   preach on the test passage Prov. viii. 22. This he did to a vast and
   eagerly expectant congregation. To the delight of the majority (headed
   by Diodorus and Flavian), although he avoided the homoousion, he spoke
   with no uncertain sound on the essential likeness of the Son to the
   Father. Formally Nicene,' indeed, the sermon was not (text in Epiph.
   HÃ¦r. lxxiii. 29-33, see Hort, p. 96, note 1), but the dismay of the
   Homoean bishops equalled the joy of the Catholic laity. Meletius was
   deposed' in favour of the old Arian Euzoius (infr., p. 70), and after
   his return under Jovian gave in his formal adhesion to the Nicene test.

   (3.) The history of Athanasius during this period is the history of his
   writings. Hidden from all but devotedly loyal eyes, whether in the
   cells of Nitria and the Thebaid, or lost in the populous solitude of
   his own city, he followed with a keen and comprehensive glance the
   march of events outside. Two men in this age had skill to lay the
   physician's finger upon the pulse of religious conviction; Hilary, the
   Western who had learned to understand and sympathise with the East,
   Athanasius, the Oriental representative of the theological instincts of
   the West. First of all came the writings of which we have spoken, the
   circular to the bishops and the Apology to Constantius; then the
   dignified Apology for his flight, written not long before the expulsion
   of George late in 358, when he had begun to realise the merciless
   enmity and profound duplicity of the Emperor. We find him not long
   after this in correspondence with the exiled confessor, Lucifer of
   Calaris (pp. 561 sq., 481 sqq.), and warning the Egyptian monks against
   compromising relations with Arian visitors (Letter 53, a document of
   high interest), narrating to the trusted Serapion the facts as to the
   death of Arius, and sending to the monks a concise refutation of Arian
   doctrine (Letters 52, 54). With the latter is associated a reissue of
   the Apology of 351, and, as a continuation of it, the solitary monument
   of a less noble spirit which Athanasius has left us, the one work which
   we would gladly believe to have come from any other pen [79] . But this
   supposition is untenable, and in the ferocious pamphlet against
   Constantius known as the Arian History we are reminded that noble as he
   was, our saint yet lived in an age of fierce passions and reckless
   personal violence. The Arian History has its noble features--no work of
   Athanasius could lack them--but it reveals not the man himself but his
   generation; his exasperation, and the meanness of his persecutors. (For
   details on all these tracts see the Introductions and notes to them.)
   None of the above books directly relate to the doctrinal developments
   sketched above. But these developments called forth the three greatest
   works of his exile, and indeed of his whole career. Firstly, the four
   Logoi or Tracts against Arianism, his most famous dogmatic work. Of
   these an account will be given in the proper place, but it may be
   noticed here that they are evidently written with a conciliatory as
   well as a controversial purpose, and in view of the position between
   357 and 359. Next, the four dogmatic letters to Serapion, the second of
   which reproduces the substance of his position against the Arians,
   while the other three are devoted to a question overlooked in the
   earlier stages of the controversy, the Coessentiality of the Holy
   Spirit. This work may possibly have come after the third, and in some
   ways the most striking, of the series, the de Synodis written about the
   end of 359, and intended as a formal offer of peace to the Homoeusian
   party. Following as it did closely upon the conciliatory work of
   Hilary, who was present at Seleucia on the side of the majority, this
   magnanimous Eirenicon produced an immediate effect, which we trace in
   the letters of the younger Basil written in the same or following year;
   but the full effect and justification of the book is found in the
   influence exerted by Athanasius upon the new orthodoxy which eventually
   restored the ten provinces' to the knowledge of God' (Hil. de Syn. 63.
   Further details in Introd. to de Syn., infra, p. 448. It may be
   remarked that the romantic idea of his secret presence at Seleucia, and
   even at Ariminum, must be dismissed as a too rigid inference from an
   expression used by him in that work: see note 1 there).

   This brings us to the close of the eventful period of the Third Exile,
   and of the long series of creeds which registers the variations of
   Arianism during thirty years. We may congratulate ourselves on having
   come at last to the end of the labyrinth of expositions' (Socr. ii.
   41), and within sight of the emergence of conviction out of confusion,
   of order out of chaos. The work of setting in order opens our next
   period. Of the exile there is nothing more to tell except its close.
   Hurrying from Antioch on his way from the Persian frontier to oppose
   the eastward march of Julian, Constantius caught a fever, was baptised
   by Euzoius, and died at MopsucrenÃ¦ under Mount Taurus, on Nov. 3, 361.
   Julian at once avowed the heathenism he had long cherished in secret,
   and by an edict, published in Alexandria on Feb. 9, recalled from exile
   all bishops banished by Constantius. And twelve days after the posting
   of this edict Athanasius appeared at Alexandria and entered the Church
   on the twenty-seventh day of the same month, Mechir (Feb. 21). He
   remained in the Church until the twenty-sixth of Paophi (i.e., Oct.
   23)...eight whole months' (Hist. Aceph. vii. The murder of George has
   been referred to above, p. liii.).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [71] The envoys of Magnentius had come from Italy through Libya in
   350-351. The desert' (Apol. Const. 27, 32) must be the region between
   Alxa. and Cyrenaica, not Palestine as Tillem. viii. 186, infers from
   Ep. Ã†g. 5. There is no evidence that Ath. left his province during this
   exile, and Palestine was a most dangerous territory to venture into.
   The cautious vagueness of his language, Ep. Ã†g. 5, while it baffles
   even our curiosity, yet favours the hypothesis that the events referred
   to belong to the Egyptian persecution.

   [72] This date, coming from the common source of the Historia Acephala
   and Festal Index (i.e. from the accredited Alexandrian chronology of
   the period), must be accepted unless there is cogent proof of its
   incorrectness. No such proof is offered: we have no positive statement
   to the contrary, but only (1) the fact that the intrusion of George is
   related, Apol. Fug. 6, immediately after an attack on the great church,
   possibly the coup de main of Syrianus, but more probably that of p.
   290, note 9, without any hint of a long interval. This is true, and if
   there were no evidence the other way might justify a guess that George
   came in Lent, 356; but no one would claim that the passage is
   conclusive by itself; (2) the improbability' of George delaying his
   arrival so long. Improbability is a relative term; we know too little
   of George's consecration or movements to justify its use in the present
   connection. All the evidence goes to shew that the court party were far
   from sanguine as to the nature of his reception, and that their
   misgivings were well-founded. The above considerations look very small
   when we compare them with the mass of positive evidence the other way.
   (1.) The civil Governor had changed: Maximus held the post on Feb. 8,
   356 (Hist. Ar. 81, &c.), Cataphronius when the churches were
   transferred to the party of George, see below, 6. (2.) The military
   Commander had changed: Syrianus was replaced by Sebastian, who appears
   just after the transfer of churches, Hist. Ar. 55-60 (Dr. Bright in
   D.C.B. i. 194, note, seems to admit that Sebastian belongs to a later
   date than the Lent of 356). (3.) The Wednesday (and Thursday) of Hist.
   Ar. 55 were not in Lent.' They suit the data of Hist. Aceph. perfectly
   well. (4.) Had George arrived before Easter 356, Athan. would have
   heard of it in the Desert,' Apol. Const. 27; but he has only heard of
   his nomination onomasthe 28, probably from the letters given in Â§Â§30,
   31). (5.) The Letter to the Egyptian bishops was written from Libya or
   Cyrenaica, when the coercion of the episcopate had begun: it postulates
   some time since his expulsion, but George was then (Â§7) only in
   contemplation. (6.) There is no evidence that the coup de main of
   Syrianus was other than unpopular in the city. This was reported to
   Const., who after the (Easter) outrages on the Virgins (Ap. Const. 27;
   Hist. Ar. 48), and after the expulsion of the sixteen bishops (Hist.
   Ar. 54, this was probably about Easter, Ap. Const. 27) sent Heraclius
   (with the discreditable' letter), in whose company (Hist. Ar. 55) the
   new Prefect Cataphronius first appears. This let loose the refuse of
   the heathen population as described, ib. 55-60. (7.) Here the precise
   statement of the Hist. Aceph. fits in exactly. The Presbyters and
   people of Ath. remained in possession of the Churches until the arrival
   of the new Prefect, with Count Heraclius, on June 10. (8.) Heraclius is
   expressly called the precursor of George (p. 288) and is evidently sent
   to disarm the reported hostility of the (even heathen) public to the
   appointment. It may be added that if we are to take probabilities' into
   account, it is easier to imagine a reason for a court nominee like
   George having been slow to take up a dangerous post, than for the
   Alexandrian chronologists of the day having invented a year's interval
   when none had existed. Montfaucon had already noticed that a good deal
   must have happened' between the irruption of Syrianus and the entry of
   George. The data of Athanasius are for the first time clearly explained
   by the light thrown on them by the chroniclers. I should also have
   urged the fact that the commemoration of George's Pentecost Martyrs on
   May 21 in the Roman Martyrology suits 357 and not 356, had I succeeded
   in tracing the history of the entry, which has, however, so far eluded
   my efforts.

   [73] We are quite in the dark as to when, and by whom, George was
   consecrated bishop. The statement of Sozomen iv. 8, that he was
   ordained by a council of thirty bishops at Antioch, including Theodore
   of Heraclea, who had died before the exile of Liberius in 355 (Thdt. H.
   E. ii. 16, p. 93. 13), is involved in too hopeless a tangle of
   anachronisms to be of any value for our enquiry. But that George was
   ordained in Antioch is in itself likely enough, and if so, his
   ordination would probably follow close upon the expulsion of
   Athanasius. But the repeated assurances of Ath. that George came from
   court would imply that after his ordination George went to Italy. That
   at once puts his arrival in Alxa. in Lent 356 out of the question.

   [74] The statements of Ath. as to George are made at secondhand, and
   must be taken cum grano. He is notoriously wealthy,' yet hired' by the
   Arians. (Cf. p. 249; but apparently he combined wealth and avarice.)
   That he was a heathen' is certainly untrue. His ignorance' is equally
   so: we know that he was a well-read man and possessed a remarkably good
   library (D.C.B. ii. 638). That he had the temper of a hangman' (p. 227)
   is in keeping with all that we know of him, and as to his general
   character, the statements of Athanasius and other churchmen are not
   stronger than Amm. Marcell. XXII. xi. 4 (cf. Gibbon, iii. 171 sqq., ed.
   Smith, but correct his jeu d'esprit on S. George and the Dragon' by
   Bright, in D.C.B. ubi supra; yet see Stanley, Eastern Church, Lect.
   vii. III..).

   [75] p. 497. George was at Sirmium in the Spring of 359 (Soz. (v. 16).
   Paul Catena came to Alxa. from a similar commission at Scythopolis. He
   was apparently aided in both places by Modestus the Comes Orientis.
   From Liban. Ep. 205, we gather, to the credit of George, that he was
   the intermediary of requests for mitigation on some of the sentences.
   He was at this time at Antioch, from whence also Ex Comitatu
   Principis,' Amm. XXII. xi., he returned to Alxa. in 361, evidently
   before he had heard of the Emperor's death. (Sievers, pp. 138 sq.)

   [76] We cannot fix the date when this word was first adopted as a
   shibboleth. It occurs, but not conspicuously, in the Macrostich' of
   344, but not in any other creed till the dated' symbol of 359. But if
   (as KrÃ¼ger, Lucif, p. 42, note, assumes) the homoiousion was adopted as
   a protest against the bald homoion, the latter must have been current
   long before 357, when the former was proscribed. I incline to regard
   the homoion (as a test word) as a later rival to the homoiousion

   [77] Apparently it began with the quarrel over the election to the
   bishopric of Antioch, which Eudoxius managed to seize after the death
   of Leontius. George was aggrieved at his rights as an elector being
   ignored, and may have had hopes of the see for himself. See Soz. iv.
   13; but Philost. iv. 5 with much less likelihood puts this down to
   Basil.

   [78] The discussions, reported with every appearance of substantial
   accuracy by Thdt. ii. 27, may have taken place at this time, or at the
   council of the succeeding month (Thdt. fails to distinguish the two
   meetings). Gwatkin, p. 180, appears to be right in adopting the former
   alternative, viz. that the party of Basil prudently abstained from
   attending a council in which they would be overpowered: cf. Soz. iv.
   24, who however contradicts himself in the next chapter, sub fin. But
   the case is not quite clear.

   [79] He always used amanuenses, but we have no evidence that he
   entrusted them with actual composition, p. 242.

   Â§9. Athanasius under Julian and his successors; Fourth and Fifth
   Exiles. Feb. 21, 362, to Feb. 1, 366.

   (a) The Council of Alexandria in 362. The eight months of undisturbed
   residence enjoyed by Athanasius under Julian were well employed. One of
   his first acts was to convoke a Synod at Alexandria to deal with the
   questions which stood in the way of the peace of the Church. The Synod
   was one of saints and confessors,' including as it did many of the
   Egyptian bishops who had suffered under George (p. 483, note 3, again
   we miss the name of the trusted Serapion), Asterius of Petra and
   Eusebius of Vercellae, with legates from Lucifer of Calaris,
   Apollinarius of Laodicea, and Paulinus the Presbyter who ruled the
   Eustathian community of Antioch. Our knowledge of the proceedings of
   the Synod (with an exception to be referred to later on) is derived
   entirely from its Tome' or Synodal letter addressed to the latter
   community and to the exiles who were its guests. Rufinus, from whom or
   from the Tome itself Socrates appears to derive his knowledge, follows
   the Tome closely, with perhaps a faint trace of knowledge from some
   other [80] source. Sozomen gives a short and inadequate report (v. 12).
   But the importance of the Council is out of all proportion either to
   the number of bishops who took part in it or to the scale of its
   documentary records. Jerome goes so far as to say that by its judicious
   conciliation it snatched the whole world from the jaws of Satan' (Adv.
   Lucif. 20). If this is in any measure true, if it undid both in East
   and West the humiliating results of the twin Synods of 359, the honour
   of the achievement is due to Athanasius alone. He saw that victory was
   not to be won by smiting men who were ready for peace, that the cause
   of Christ was not to be furthered by breaking the bruised reed and
   quenching the smoking flax. (Best accounts of the Council, Newman,
   Arians V. i., KrÃ¼ger, Lucif. 41-52, Gwatkin, p. 205, sqq.) The details
   may be reserved for the Introduction to the Tome, p. 481. But in the
   strong calm moderation of that document we feel that Athanasius is no
   longer a combatant arduously contending for victory, but a conqueror
   surveying the field of his triumph and resolving upon the terms of
   peace. The Council is the ripe first-fruits of the de Synodis, the
   decisive step by which he placed himself at the head of the reuniting
   forces of Eastern Christendom; forces which under the recognised
   headship of the Father of Orthodoxy' were able successfully to
   withstand the revived political supremacy of Arianism under Valens, and
   after his death to cast it out of the Church. The Council then is
   justly recognised as the crown of the career of Athanasius, for its
   resolutions and its Letter unmistakably proceed from him alone, and
   none but he could have tempered the fiery zeal of the confessors and
   taught them to distinguish friend from foe.

   It would have been well had Lucifer been there in person and not by
   deputy only. As it was he had gone to Antioch in fiery haste, with a
   promise extorted by Eusebius to do nothing rashly. Fanatical in his
   orthodoxy, quite unable to grasp the theological differences between
   the various parties (his remonstrances with Hilary upon the
   conciliatory efforts of the latter shew his total lack of theology: see
   also KrÃ¼ger, pp. 36, sq.), and concentrating all his indignation upon
   persons rather than principles, Lucifer found Antioch without a bishop;
   for Euzoius was an Arian, and Meletius, whose return to the church of
   the PalÃ¦a was (so it seems) daily expected, was to Lucifer little
   better. What to such a man could seem a quicker way to the extinction
   of the schism than the immediate ordination of a bishop whom all would
   respect, and whose record was one of the most uncompromising resistance
   to heresy? Lucifer accordingly, with the aid we may suppose of Kymatius
   and Anatolius, ordained Paulinus, the widely-esteemed head of the
   irreconcileable or (to adopt Newman's word) protestant minority, who
   had never owned any Bishop of Antioch save the deposed and banished
   Eustathius. The act of Lucifer had momentous consequences (see D.C.B.
   on Meletius and Flavian, &c.); it perpetuated the existing tendency to
   schism between East and West; and but for the forbearance of Athanasius
   it would perhaps have wrecked the alliance of Conservative Asia with
   Nicene orthodoxy which his later years cemented. Even as it was, the
   relations between Athanasius and Basil were sorely tried by the schism
   of Antioch. The Tome however was signed by Paulinus [81] , who added a
   short statement of his own faith, which, by recognising the legitimacy
   of the theological language of the other catholic party at Antioch,
   implicitly conceded the falseness of his own position.

   Eusebius and Asterius of Petra carried the letter to Antioch, where
   they found the mischief already done. In deep pain at the headstrong
   action of his fellow-countryman, Eusebius gave practical assurance to
   both parties of his full sympathy and recognition, and made his way
   home through Asia and Illyria, doing his best in the cause of concord
   wherever he came. Lucifer renounced communion with all the parties to
   what he considered a guilty compromise, and journeyed home to Sardinia,
   making mischief everywhere (terribly so at Naples, according to the
   grotesque tale in the Lib. Prec.; see D.C.B. iv. 1221 under Zosimus
   (2)), and ended his days in the twofold reputation of saint and
   schismatic (KrÃ¼ger, pp. 55, 116 sq.).

   It may be well to add a few words upon the supposed Coptic acts of this
   council, and upon their connection with the very ancient Syntagma
   DoctrinÃ¦, wrongly so named, and wrongly ascribed to Athanasius. These
   acts' are in reality a series of documents consisting of (1) The Nicene
   Creed, Canons, and Signatures; (2) A Coptic recension of the Syntagma
   DoctrinÃ¦; (3) the letter of Paulinus from Tom. Ant., sub fin., a letter
   of Epiphanius, and a fragmentary letter of Rufinus,' i.e. Rufinianus
   (see infr. p. 566, note 1). Revillout, who published these texts from a
   Turin and a Roman (Borgia) manuscript in 1881 (Le Concile de NicÃ©e
   d'apres les textes Coptes) jumped (Archives des missions scientifiques
   et littÃ©raires, 1879) at the conclusion that the whole series emanated
   from the council of 362, from whose labours all our copies of the
   Nicene canons and signatures are supposed by him to emanate. His theory
   cannot be discussed at length in this place. It is worked out with
   ingenuity, but with insufficient knowledge of general Church history.
   It appears to be adopted wholesale by Eichhorn in his otherwise
   critical and excellent Athanasii de vita ascetica testimonia (see
   below, p. 189); but even those whose scepticism has not been awaked by
   the hypothesis itself must I think be satisfied by the careful study of
   M. Batiffol (Studia Patristica, fasc. ii.) that Revillout has erected a
   castle in the air. Of any acts' of the Council of 362 the documents
   contain no trace at all. It is therefore out of place to do more than
   allude here to the great interest of the Syntagma in its three or four
   extant recensions in connection at once with the history of Egyptian
   Monasticism and with the literature of the Didache ton ib' apostolon
   (see Harnack in Theol. Litzg. 1887, pp. 32, sqq., Eichhorn, ib. p. 569,
   Warfield in Andover Review, 1886, p. 81, sqq., and other American
   literature referred to by Harnack a.a.O).

   All over the Empire the exiles were returning, and councils were held
   (p. 489), repudiating the Homoean formula of union, and affirming that
   of NicÃ¦a. In dealing with the question of those who had formerly
   compromised themselves with Arianism, these councils followed the lead
   of that of Alexandria, which accordingly is justly said by Jerome (adv.
   Lucif. 20) to have snatched the world from the jaws of Satan, by
   obviating countless schisms and attaching to the Church many who might
   otherwise have been driven back into Arianism.

   Such were the more enduring results of the recall of the exiled bishops
   by Julian; results very different from what he contemplated in
   recalling them. Apparently before the date of the council he had
   written to the Alexandrians (Ep. 26), explaining that he had recalled
   the exiles to their countries, not to their sees, and directing that
   Athanasius, who ought after so many sentences against him to have asked
   special permission to return, should leave the City at once on pain of
   severer punishment. An appeal seems to have been made against this
   order by the people of Alexandria, but without effect. Pending the
   appeal Athanasius apparently felt safe in remaining in the town, and
   carrying out the measures described above. In October (it would seem)
   Julian wrote an indignant letter to the Prefect Ecdikius Olympus
   (Sievers, p. 124), threatening a heavy fine if Athanasius, the enemy of
   the gods,' did not leave not only Alexandria, but Egypt, at once. He
   adds an angry comment on his having dared to baptize in my reign' Greek
   ladies of rank (Ep. 6). Another letter (Ep. 51) to the people of
   Alexandria, along with arguments in favour of Serapis and the gods, and
   against Christ, reiterates the order for Athanasius to leave Egypt by
   Dec. 1. Julian's somewhat petulant reference to the bishop as a
   contemptible little fellow' ill conceals his evident feeling that
   Athanasius, who had coped with Constantius like a king battling with a
   king' (Greg. Naz.), was in Egypt a power greater than himself. But no
   man has ever wielded such political power as Athanasius with so little
   disposition to use it. He bowed his head to the storm and prepared to
   leave Alexandria once more (Oct. 23). His friends stood round lamenting
   their loss. Be of good heart,' he replied, it is only a cloud, and will
   soon pass away' (Soz. v. 14). He took a Nile boat, and set off toward
   Upper Egypt, but finding that he was tracked by the government officers
   he directed the boat's course to be reversed. Presently they met that
   of the pursuers, who suspecting nothing asked for news of Athanasius.
   He is not far off' was the answer, given according to one account by
   Athanasius himself (Thdt. iii. 9, Socr. iii. 14). He returned to
   ChÃ¦reu, the first station on the road eastward from Alexandria (as is
   inferred from the Thereu or Thereon of Hist. Aceph. vii., viii.; but
   the identification is merely conjectural; for ChÃ¦reu cf. Itin. and Vit.
   Ant. 86), and after danger of pursuit was over, ascended to the upper
   parts of Egypt as far as Upper Hermupolis in the Thebaid and as far as
   Antinoupolis; and while he abode in these places it was learned that
   Julian the Emperor was dead, and that Jovian, a Christian, was Emperor'
   (Hist. Aceph.). Of his stay in the Thebaid (cf. Fest. Ind. xxxv.) some
   picturesque details are preserved in the life of Pachomius and the
   letter of Ammon (on which see below, p. 487). As he approached
   Hermupolis, the bishops, clergy, and monks (about 100 in number') of
   the Thebaid lined both banks of the river to welcome him. Who are
   these,' he exclaimed, that fly as a cloud and as doves with their young
   ones' (Isa. lx. 8, LXX). Then he saluted the Abbat Theodore, and asked
   after the brethren. By thy holy prayers, Father, we are well.' He was
   mounted on an ass and escorted to the monastery with burning torches
   (they almost set fire to him'), the abbat walking before him on foot.
   He inspected the monasteries, and expressed his high approval of all he
   heard and saw, and when Theodore, upon departing for his Easter (363)
   visitation [82] of the brethren, asked the Pope' to remember him in his
   prayers, the answer was characteristic: If we forget thee, O Jerusalem'
   (Vit. Pachom. 92, see p. 569). About midsummer he was near
   Antinoupolis, and trusted messengers warned him that the pursuers were
   again upon his track. Theodore brought his covered boat to escort him
   up to Tabenne, and in company with an abbat' called Pammon they made
   their way slowly against wind and stream. Athanasius became much
   alarmed and prayed earnestly to himself, while Theodore's monks towed
   the boat from the shore. Athanasius, in reply to an encouraging remark
   of Pammon, spoke of the peace of mind he felt when under persecution,
   and of the consolation of suffering and even death for Christ's sake.
   Pammon looked at Theodore, and they smiled, barely restraining a laugh.
   You think me a coward,' said Athanasius. Tell him,' said Theodore to
   Pammon. No, you must tell him.' Theodore then announced to the
   astonished archbishop that at that very hour Julian had been killed in
   Persia, and that he should lose no time in making his way to the new
   Christian Emperor, who would restore him to the Church. The story
   (below, p. 487) implies rather than expressly states that the day and
   hour tallied exactly with the death of Julian, June 26, 363. This story
   is, on the whole, the best attested of the many legends of the kind
   which surround the mysterious end of the unfortunate prince. (Cf. Thdt.
   H. E. iii. 23, Soz. vi. 2. For the religious policy of Julian and his
   relation to Church history, see Rendall's Julian and the full and
   excellent article by Wordsworth in D.C.B. iii. 484-525.)

   Athanasius entered Alexandria secretly and made his way by way of
   Hierapolis (Sept. 6, Fest. Ind.) to Jovian at Edessa, and returned with
   him (apparently) to Antioch. On Feb. 14 (or 20, Fest. Index) he
   returned to Alexandria with imperial letters and took possession of the
   churches, his fourth exile having lasted fifteen months and twenty-two
   days' (Hist. Aceph.). The visit to Antioch was important.

   Firstly, it is clear from the combined and circumstantial testimony of
   the Festal Index, the Hist. Aceph., and the narrative of Ammon, that
   Athanasius hurried to meet Jovian on his march from Persia to Antioch,
   and visited Alexandria only in passing and in private. He appears to
   have taken the precaution (see below) of taking certain bishops and
   others, representing the majority (plethos) of the Egyptian Church,
   along with him. Accordingly the tale of Theodoret (iv. 2), that he
   assembled a council (tous logimoterous ton episkopon egeiras), and
   wrote a synodal letter to Jovian, in reply to a request from the latter
   to furnish him with an accurate statement of doctrine (followed by
   Montf., Hefele, &c.) must be set aside as a hasty conjecture from the
   heading of the Letter to Jovian (see below, ch. v. Â§3 (h), and cf.
   Vales. on Thdt. iv. 3, who suspected the truth).

   Athanasius, secondly, had good reason for hurrying. The Arians had also
   sent a large deputation to petition against the restoration of
   Athanasius, and to ask for a bishop. Lucius, their candidate for the
   post, accompanied the deputation. But the energy of Athanasius was a
   match for their schemes. He obtained a short but emphatic letter from
   Jovian, bidding him return to his see, and placed in the Emperor's
   hands a letter (below, Letter 56, p. 567), insisting on the integrity
   of the Nicene creed, which it recites, and especially on the Godhead of
   the Holy Spirit.

   Meanwhile at Antioch, where the winter was spent (Jovian was mostly
   there till Dec. 21), there was much to be attended to. Least important
   of all were the efforts of the Arian deputation to secure a hearing for
   their demands. Jovian's replies to them on the repeated occasions on
   which they waylaid him are perhaps undignified (Gwatkin) but yet shew a
   rough soldier-like common sense. Any one you please except Athanasius'
   they urged. I told you, the case of Athanasius is settled already:'
   then, to the body-guard Feri, feri' (i.e. use your sticks!) Some of the
   plethos of Antioch seized Lucius and brought him to Jovian, saying,
   Look, your Majesty, at the man they wanted to make a bishop!' (See p.
   568 sq.)

   Athanasius appears to have attempted to bring about some settlement of
   the disputes which distracted the Church of Antioch. The Hist. Aceph.
   makes him arrange the affairs' of that Church, but Sozom. (vi. 5), who
   copies the phrase, significantly adds hos hoi& 231;n te en--as far as
   it was feasible.' The vacillations (Philost. viii. 2, 7, ix. 3, &c.) of
   Euzoius between Eudoxius on the one hand, and the consistent Anomoeans
   on the other, and the formation of a definite Anomoean sect,
   represented in Egypt by Heliodorus, Stephen, and other nominees of the
   bitter Arian Secundus (who appears to be dead at last) probably
   concerned Athanasius but little. But the breach among the Antiochene
   Catholics was more hopeless than ever. The action of Paulinus in
   ordaining a bishop for Tyre, Diodorus by name (p. 580 note), shews that
   he had caught something of the spirit of Lucifer, while on the other
   hand we can well imagine that it was with mixed feelings that
   Athanasius saw a number of bishops assemble under Meletius to sign the
   Nicene Creed. To begin with, they explained the homoousion to be
   equivalent to ek tes ousias and homoion kat' ousian. Now this was no
   more than taking Athanasius literally at his word (de Syn. 41 exactly;
   the confession, Socr. iii. 25, appears to meet Ath. de Syn. half way:
   cf. the reference to 'Ellenike chresis with de Syn. 51), and there is
   no reason to doubt that the majority [83] of those who signed did so in
   all sincerity, merely guarding the homoousion against its Sabellian
   sense (which Hilary de Syn. 71, had admitted as possible), and in fact,
   meaning by the term exactly what Basil the Great and his school meant
   by it. This is confirmed by the express denunciation of Arianism and
   Anomoeanism. But Athanasius may have suspected an intention on the part
   of some signatories to evade the full sense of the creed, especially as
   touching the Holy Spirit, and this suspicion would not be lessened by
   the fact that Acacius signed with the rest. It must remain possible,
   therefore, that a clause in the letter to Jovian referred to above,
   expresses his displeasure [84] at the wording of the document. (On the
   significance of the confession in question, see Gwatkin, pp. 226 sq.,
   244, note 1.) We gather from language used by St. Basil at a later date
   (Bas. Epp. 89, 258) that Athanasius endeavoured to conciliate Meletius,
   and to bring about some understanding between the two parties in the
   Church. Meletius appears to have considered such efforts premature:
   Basil writes to him that he understands that Athanasius is much
   disappointed that no renewal of friendly overtures has taken place, and
   that if Meletius desires the good offices of the Bishop of Alexandria
   the first word must come from him (probably seven or eight years later
   than this date). In justice to Meletius it must be allowed that
   Paulinus did his best to embitter the schism by ordaining bishops at
   Tyre and elsewhere, ordinations which Meletius naturally resented, and
   appears to have ignored (D.C.B. iv. Zeno (3),--where observe that the
   breach of canons began with the appointment of Paulinus himself).
   Athanasius returned to Alexandria on Feb. 14 (Hist. Aceph.) or 20
   (Fest. Ind.), and Jovian died, by inhaling the fumes of a charcoal fire
   in the bedroom of a wayside inn, on Feb. 17.

   Valentinian, an officer of Pannonian birth, was elected Emperor by the
   army, and shortly co-opted his brother Valens to a share in the Empire.
   Valens was allotted the Eastern, Valentinian choosing the Western half
   of the Empire. Valentinian was a convinced but tolerant Catholic, and
   under his reign Arianism practically died away in the Latin West
   (infra, p. 488). Valens, a weak, parsimonious, but respectable and
   well-intentioned ruler, at first took no decided line, but eventually
   (from the end of 364) fell more and more into the hands of Eudoxius
   (from whom he received baptism in 367) and the Arian hangers-on of the
   Court (a suggestive, if in some details disputable, sketch of the
   general condition of the Eastern Church under Valens in Gwatkin, pp.
   228-236, 247 sq.). The semi-Arians of Asia were continuing their
   advance toward the Nicene position, but the question of the Holy Spirit
   was already beginning to cleave them into two sections. At their
   council of Lampsacus (autumn of 364) they reasserted their formula of
   essential likeness' against the Homoeans, but appear to have left the
   other and more difficult question undecided. After Valens had declared
   strongly on the side of the enemy, they were driven to seek Western
   aid. They set out to seek Valentinian at Milan, but finding him
   departed on his Gallic campaign (Gwatkin, 236, note) they contented
   themselves with laying before Liberius, on behalf of the Synod of
   Lampsacus and other Asiatic Councils, a letter accepting the Nicene
   Creed. After some hesitation (Soc. iv. 12) they were cordially received
   by Liberius, who gave them a letter to take home with them, in which
   the controverted question of the Holy Spirit is passed over in silence.
   (Letter of the Asiatics in Socr. iv. 12, that of Liberius in Hard.
   Conc. i. 743-5, the names include Cyril of Jerusalem, Macedonius,
   Silvanus of Tarsus, Athanasius of Ancyra, &c., and the Pope's letter is
   addressed to them et universis orientalibus orthodoxis'). On their
   return, the disunion of the party manifested itself by the refusal of
   several bishops to attend the synod convoked to receive the deputies at
   Tyana, and by their assembling a rival meeting in Caria to reaffirm the
   Lucianic' Creed (Hefele, ii. 287 E. Tr.). Further efforts at reunion
   were frustrated by the Imperial prohibition of an intended Synod at
   Tarsus, possibly in 367.

   Athanasius remained in peace in his see until the spring of 365, when
   on May 5 a rescript was published at Alexandria, ordering that all
   bishops expelled under Constantius who had returned to their sees under
   Julian should be at once expelled by the civil authorities under pain
   of a heavy fine. The announcement was received with great popular
   displeasure. The officials were anxious to escape the fine, but the
   Church-people argued that the order could not apply to Athanasius, who
   had been restored by Constantius, expelled by Julian in the interest of
   idolatry, and restored by order of Jovian. Their remonstrances were
   backed up by popular riots: when these had lasted a month, the Prefect
   quieted the people by the assurance that the matter was referred back
   to Augustus (Hist. Aceph. x., followed by Soz. vi. 12). But on Oct. 5
   an imperative answer seems to have come. The Prefect and the Commandant
   broke into the Church of Dionysius at night and searched the apartments
   of the clergy to seize the bishop. But Athanasius, warned in time, had
   escaped from the town that very night and retired to a country house
   which belonged to him near the New River' [85] . This was the shortest
   and mildest of the five exiles of Athanasius. In the autumn the
   dangerous revolt of Procopius threw the Eastern Empire into a panic. It
   was no time to allow popular discontent to smoulder at Alexandria, and
   on Feb. 1, 366, the notary Brasidas publicly announced the recall of
   Athanasius to Imperial order. The notary and curiales' went out to the
   suburb in person and escorted Athanasius in state to the Church of
   Dionysius.

   [80] He states (1) That a rigorist party in the council were at first
   opposed to all conciliatory measures; this is highly probable, see
   Hieron. adv. Lucif. 20; (2) that former active Arians were to be
   admitted to lay communion only; this is not unlikely; (3) by
   implication, that Eusebius and Lucifer went first to Antioch, and
   agreed to take no step till after the Council which Eus. was to attend
   in person, and Luc. by deputy, at Alxa., but that Luc. broke his
   promise. This may contain a grain of truth, i.e. that Lucifer promised
   to do nothing before he heard from Alxa., but Eusebius can scarcely
   have gone to Antioch. I owe these notices to the excellent analysis of
   our sources of information in KrÃ¼ger, Lucif. p. 46 sq.; but he makes an
   odd slip, p. 48, in saying that Soz. schweigt von der Synode zu Alex.
   uberhaupt.'

   [81] This is placed later in 363 by Dr. Bright, D.C.B. i. 199, on the
   ground of a statement of Epiphanius, HÃ¦r. 77. 20, which, however, is
   not quite decisive on the point.

   [82] KrÃ¼ger, in Theol. Litzg. 1890, p. 620 sqq., fixes the death of
   Theodore for Easter 363, on the ground, as I venture to think, of a
   date (345) for the death of Pachomius too early by one year. The
   question is too intricate to discuss here, but with all deference to so
   competent a critic, I am confident that Theodore lived till at any rate
   the following Easter. See infr. p. 569, note 3.

   [83] This is certainly true of men like Athanasius of Ancyra, Eusebius
   of Samosata, Pelagius of Laodicea, Titus of Bostra, &c.

   [84] The tract de Hypocrisi Meletii et Eusebii printed among the
   dubious' works of Athanasius may well express the sentiments of some of
   his friends of the party of Paulinus on this occasion. (Tillem. viii.
   708.)

   [85] So Hist. Aceph., Fest. Ind. Socrates iv. 13 says he hid four
   months in his Father's tomb.' Soz. vi. 12, mentions the story, but
   finding it contradicted by the Hist. Aceph., adopts the vague
   compromise eis ti chorion ekrupteto. The New River' divided Alexandria
   from its Western suburbs.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§10. Last Years, Feb. 1, 366-May 2, 373.

   Athanasius now entered upon the last septennium of his life, a
   well-earned Sabbath of honoured peace and influence for good. Little
   occurred to disturb his peace at home, and if the confusion and
   distress of the Eastern Church under Valens could not but cause him
   anxiety, in Egypt at any rate, so long as he lived, the Catholic Faith
   was secure from molestation.

   In 367 Lucius, who had been ordained Bishop of Alexandria by the Arian
   party at Antioch, made an attempt to enter the city. He arrived by
   night on Sept. 24, but on the following day the public got wind of his
   presence in Alexandria, and a dangerous riot was imminent. A strong
   military force rescued him from the enraged mob, and on Sept. 26 he was
   escorted out of Egypt. In the previous year a heathen riot had taken
   place and the great Church in the CÃ¦sareum had been burned. But in May,
   368, the building was recommenced (the incendiaries having been
   punished) under an Imperial order.

   On Sept. 22, 368, Athanasius began to build a Church in the quarter
   Mendidium' (perhaps in commemoration of his completion of the 40th year
   of his Episcopate, see Hist. Aceph. xii.), which was dedicated Aug. 7,
   370, and called after his own name.

   In 368 or the following year we place the Synod at which Athanasius
   drew up his letter to the bishops of Africa giving an account of the
   proceedings at NicÃ¦a, and mentioning his dissatisfaction at the
   continued immunity enjoyed by Auxentius at Milan (see p. 488).

   Our knowledge of the last years of the life of Athanasius is derived
   partly from his own letters (59-64), partly from the scanty data of his
   latest works, partly from the letters of Synesius and Basil. From
   Synesius (Ep. 77) we hear of the case of Siderius, a young officer from
   the army who was present in Libya on civil duty. The Bishop of
   Erythrum, Orion by name, was in his dotage, and the inhabitants of two
   large villages in the diocese, impatient of the lack of supervision,
   clamoured for a bishop of their own, and for the appointment of
   Siderius. Siderius was accordingly consecrated by a certain Bishop
   Philo alone, without the canonical two assistants, and without the
   cognisance of Athanasius. But in view of the immense utility of the
   appointment Athanasius overlooked its irregularity, and even promoted
   Siderius to the Metropolitan see of Ptolemais, merging the two villages
   upon Orion's death once more into their proper diocese. (Fuller details
   D.C.B. iv. 777, sq.) But if Athanasius was no slave to ecclesiastical
   discipline when the good of the church was in question, he enforced it
   unsparingly in the interest of morality. An immoral governor of Libya
   was sternly excommunicated and the fact announced far and wide. We have
   the reply of Basil the Great, who in 370 had become Bishop of CÃ¦sarea
   in Cappadocia, to this notification, and from this time frequent
   letters passed between the champions of the Old and of the New Nicene
   orthodoxy. Unhappily we have none of the letters of Athanasius: those
   of Basil shew us that the loss is one to be deplored. The
   correspondence bore partly on the continuance of the unhappy schism at
   Antioch. Basil asks for the mediation of Athanasius; if he could not
   bring himself to write a letter to the bishops in communion with
   Meletius, he might at least use his influence with Paulinus and prevail
   upon him to withdraw. He also presses Meletius to take the initiative
   in conciliation: possibly he did so, at least one of Basil's letters is
   sent by the hand of one of Meletius' deacons (Bas. Epp. 60, 66, 69, 80,
   82, 89). But nothing came of the application:' Meletius probably felt
   injured at the strong support Athanasius had given to Paulinus, even in
   so questionable an affair as that of Diodorus of Tyre (supra, Â§9, and
   cf. Letter 64); while Athanasius was too deeply committed to surrender
   Paulinus, who again was the last man to yield of his own accord (Thdt.
   H. E. v. 23).

   Basil obtained the good offices of Athanasius in his attempt to induce
   the bishops of Rome and the West to give him some support in his
   efforts against heresy in the East; but the failure here was due to the
   selfishness and arrogance of the Westerns. (Epp. 61, 67).

   Basil was also troubled with the continued refusal of Athanasius and
   the Westerns to repudiate Marcellus, who was still living in extreme
   old age, and to whom the mass of the people at Ancyra were attached
   (Bas. Ep. 266, Legat. Eugen. 1, anarithmeton plethos). This state of
   things, he urged, kept alive the prejudice of many against the Nicene
   decrees (Ep. 69). But the Marcellians, perhaps aware of the efforts of
   Basil, sent a deputation, headed by the deacon Eugenius, and fortified
   by letters from the bishops' of Macedonia and Achaia, to Alexandria. A
   synod was apparently in readiness to receive them, and upon demand they
   produced a statement of their faith, emphatically adopting the Nicene
   creed, condemning Sabellius, but affirming an en hupostasei triada. The
   distinction between Logos and the Son is rejected, and the idea that
   the Monad existed before the Son anathematised. Photinus is classed as
   a heretic with Paul of Samosata. Only the eternal duration of Christ's
   kingdom is not mentioned. (It may be noted that while this letter gives
   up many points of the theology of Marcellus, the process is quite
   completed in a letter submitted by the Marcellian community in 375 to
   some exiled Egyptian bishops at DiocÃ¦sarea [86] ; Epiph. HÃ¦r. 72, 11).
   Athanasius accepted the confession, and the assembled bishops
   subscribed their names (only a few signatures are preserved). While we
   understand Basil's regret at the refusal of Athanasius to condemn
   Marcellus, we can scarcely share it. If Athanasius shewed partiality
   toward his old ally, it was an error of generosity, or rather let us
   say a recognition of the truth, too often forgotten in religious
   controversy, that mistakes are not necessarily heresies, and that a man
   may go very far wrong in his opinions and yet be entitled to sympathy
   and respect.

   Basil speaks of Athanasius in terms of unbounded veneration and praise,
   and Athanasius in turn rebukes those who attempted to disparage Basil's
   orthodoxy, calling him a bishop such as any church might desire to call
   its own (p. 579 sq.).

   During the last decade of his life the attention of Athanasius was
   drawn to the questions raised by the Arian controversy as to the human
   nature of our Lord. The Arian doctrine on this subject was apparently
   as old as Lucian, but the whole subject received little or no attention
   in the earlier stages of the controversy, and it was only with the rise
   of the Anomoean school that the questions came into formal discussion.
   In the later letters of Athanasius we see the traces of wide-spread
   controversy on the matter (especially in that to Epictetus, No. 59),
   and Apollinarius, bishop of the Syrian Laodicea, and a former close
   friend of Athanasius, whose legates in 362 had joined in condemning the
   Arian Christology, broached a peculiar theory on the subject, viz.,
   that while Christ took a human soul along with His Body, the Word took
   the place of the human spirit, pneuma (1 Thess. v. 23). The details of
   the system do not belong to our subject (an excellent sketch in
   Gwatkin's Arian Controversy, pp. 136-141); in fact it was two years
   after the death of Athanasius when Apollinarius definitely founded a
   sect by consecrating a schismatic bishop for the already distracted
   Church of Antioch. But Athanasius marked with alarm the tendency of his
   friend, and in the very last years of his life wrote a tract against
   his tenet in two short books, in which, as in writing against Marcellus
   and Photinus 15 years before, he refrains from mentioning Apollinarius
   by name. It may be observed that at the close of the second book he
   brings himself for the first time to censure by name him they call
   Photinus,' classing him along with Paul of Samosata.

   Athanasius was active to the last; spiritually (we are not able to say
   physically) his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.' In his
   seventy-fifth year he entered (Ruf. ii. 3) upon the forty-sixth year of
   his episcopate. Feeling that his end was near, he followed the example
   of his revered predecessor Alexander, and named Peter as the man whom
   he judged fittest to succeed him; then on the seventh of Pachon [87]
   (May 2, 373) he departed this life in a wonderful manner.'

   (!) by Marcellus.

   Chapter III.

   Writings and Personal Characteristics of S. Athanasius

   Â§1. It will be attempted to give a complete list of his writings in
   chronological order; those included in this volume will be marked with
   an asterisk and enumerated in this place without remark. The figures
   prefixed indicate the probable date.

   (1) 318: *Two books contra Gentes,' viz. c. Gent. and De Incarn. (2)
   321-2: *Depositio Arii (on its authorship, see Introd.) (3) 328-373:
   *Festal Letters. (4) 328-335? *Ecthesis or Expositio Fidei. (5) Id.?
   *In Illud Omnia, etc. (6) 339: *Encyclica ad Episcopos ecclesiÃ¦
   catholicÃ¦. (7) 343: *Sardican Letters (46, 47, in this vol.). (8) 351?
   *Apologia Contra Arianos. (9) 352? *De Decretis Concilii NicÃ¦ni, with
   the *Epistola Eusebii (a.d. 325) as appendix. (10) Id.? *De Sententia
   Dionysii. (11) 350-353? *Ad Amun, (Letter 48). (12) 354: *Ad Dracontium
   (Letter 49 in this vol.). (13) 356-362? *Vita Antoni. (14) 356:
   *Epistola ad Episc. Ã†gypti et LibyÃ¦. (15) 356-7: *Apol. ad Constantium.
   (16) 357: *Apol. de Fuga. (17) 358: *Epist. ad Serapionem de Morte Arii
   (Letter 54). (18) ID. *Two Letters to Monks (52, 53). (19) 358?
   *Historia Arianorum ad monachos.' (20) Id. *Orationes adversus Arianos
   IV. (21) 359? *Ad Luciferum (Letters 50, 51). (22) Id.? Ad Serapionem
   Orationes IV. (Migne xxvi. 529, sqq.). These logoi or dogmatic letters
   are the most important work omitted in the present volume. Serapion of
   Thmuis, who appears from the silence respecting him in the lists of
   exiles to have escaped banishment in 356-7, reported to Athanasius the
   growth of the doctrine that, while the Son was co-essential with the
   Father, the Spirit was merely a creature superior to Angels. Athanasius
   replied in a long dogmatic letter, upon receiving which Serapion was
   begged to induce the author to abridge it for the benefit of the
   simple. After some hesitation Athanasius sent two more letters, the
   second drawing out the proofs of the Godhead of the Son, the third
   restating more concisely the argument of the first. The objections by
   which these letters were met were replied to in a fourth letter which
   Athanasius declared to be his last word. The persons combated are not
   the Macedonians, who only formed a party on this question at a later
   date, and whose position was not quite that combated in these letters.
   Athanasius calls them Tropikoi, or Figurists,' from the sense in which
   they understood passages of Scripture which seemed to deify the Holy
   Spirit. It is not within our compass to summarise the treatises, but it
   may be noted that Ath. argues that where pneuma is absolute or
   anarthrous in Scripture it never refers to the Holy Spirit unless the
   context already supplies such reference (i. 4, sqq.). He meets the
   objection that the Spirit, if God and of God, must needs be a Son, by
   falling back upon the language of Scripture as our guide where human
   analogies fail us. He also presses his opponents with the consequence
   that they substitute a Dyad for a Trinity. In the fourth letter, at the
   request of Serapion, he gives an explanation of the words of Christ
   about Sin Against the Spirit. Rejecting the view (Origen, Theognostus)
   that post-baptismal sin is meant (Â§Â§9, sqq.), as favouring Novatianist
   rigour, he examines the circumstances under which our Lord uttered the
   warning. The Pharisees refused to regard the Lord as divine when they
   saw His miracles, but ascribed them to Beelzebub. They blasphemed the
   Spirit,' i.e. the Divine Personality of Christ (Â§19, cf. Lam. iv. 20,
   LXX.). So far as the words relate to the Holy Spirit, it is not because
   the Spirit worked through Him (as through a prophet) but because He
   worked through the Spirit (20). Blasphemy against the Spirit, then, is
   blasphemy against Christ in its worst form (see also below, ch. iv.,
   Â§6). It may be noted lastly that he refers to Origen in the same terms
   of somewhat measured praise (ho polumathes kai philoponos), as in the
   De Decretis.

   (23) 359-60. *De Synodis Arimini et SeleuciÃ¦ celebratis. (24) 362:
   *Tomus Ad Antiochenos. (25) Id. Syntagma DoctrinÃ¦ (?) see chapter ii.
   Â§9, above. (26) 362: *Letter to Rufinianus (Letter 55). (27) 363-4:
   *Letter to Jovian (Letter 56). (28) 364? *Two small Letters to Orsisius
   (57, 58). (29) 369? *Synodal Letter Ad Afros. (30) Id.? *Letter to
   Epictetus (59). (31) Id.? *Letters to Adelphius and Maximus (60, 61).
   (32) 363-372 ? *Letter to Diodorus of Tyre (fragment, Letter 64). (33)
   372: *Letters to John and Antiochus and to Palladius (62, 63). (34)
   372? Two books against Apollinarianism (Migne xxvi. 1093, sqq.
   Translated with notes, &c., in Bright, Later Treatises of St. Athan.).
   The two books are also known under separate titles: Book I. as De
   Incarnatione D.N.J.C. contra Apollinarium,' Book II. as De Salutari
   Adventu D.N.J.C.' The Athanasian authorship has been doubted, chiefly
   on the ground of certain peculiar expressions in the opening of Book
   I.; a searching investigation of the question has not yet been made,
   but on the whole the favourable verdict of Montfaucon holds the field.
   He lays stress on the affinity of the work to letters 59-61. I would
   add that the studious omission of any personal reference to
   Apollinarius is highly characteristic.) In the first book Athanasius
   insists on the reality of the human nature of Christ in the Gospels,
   and that it cannot be co-essential with the Godhead. We do not worship
   a creature?' No; for we worship not the Flesh of Christ as such but the
   Person who wears it, viz. the Son of God. Lastly, he urges that the
   reality of redemption is destroyed if the Incarnation does not extend
   to the spirit of man, the seat of that sin which Christ came to atone
   for (Â§19), and seeks to fasten upon his opponents a renewal (Â§Â§20, 21)
   of the system of Paul of Samosata.

   The second book is addressed to the question of the compatibility of
   the entire manhood with the entire sinlessness of Christ. This
   difficulty he meets by insisting that the Word took in our nature all
   that God had made, and nothing that is the work of the devil. This
   excludes sin, and includes the totality of our nature.

   This closes the list of the dated works which can be ascribed with fair
   probability to Athanasius.

   The remainder of the writings of Athanasius may be enumerated under
   groups, to which the dated' works will also be assigned by their
   numbers as given above. Works falling into more than one class are
   given under each.

   a. Letters. (Numbers 3, 7, 11, 12, 17, 18, 21, 26-28, 30-33; spurious
   letters, see infr. p. 581.)

   b. Dogmatic. (2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 14, 20, 22-24, 26, 27, 29-31, 34.)

   (35.) De Trinitate et Spiritu Sancto (Migne xxvi. 1191). Preserved in
   Latin only, but evidently from the Greek. Pronounced genuine by
   Montfaucon, and dated (?) 365.

   (36) De Incarnatione et Contra Arianos (ib. 984). The Athanasian
   authorship of this short tract is very questionable. It is quoted as
   genuine by Theodoret Dial. ii. and by Gelasius de duabus naturis. In
   some councils it is referred to as On the Trinity against
   Apollinarius;' by Facundus as On the Trinity.' The tract is in no sense
   directed against Apollinarius. In reality it is an argument, mainly
   from Scripture, for the divinity of Christ, with a digression (13-19)
   on that of the Holy Spirit. On the whole the evidence is against the
   favourable verdict of Montfaucon, Ceillier, &c. That Athanasius should,
   at any date possible for this tract, have referred to the Trinity as
   the three Hypostases' is out of the question (Â§10): his explanation of
   Prov. viii. 22 in Orat. ii. 44 sqq. is in sharp contrast with its
   reference to the Church in Â§6; at a time when the ideas of Apollinarius
   were in the air and were combated by Athanasius (since 362) he would
   not have used language savouring of that system (Â§Â§2, 3, 5, 7, &c.). It
   has been thought that we have here one of the Apollinarian tracts which
   were so industriously and successfully circulated under celebrated
   names (infra, on No. 40); the express insistence on two wills in Christ
   (Â§21), if not in favour of Athanasian might seem decisive against
   Apollinarian authorship, but the peculiar turn of the passage, which
   correlates the one will with sarx the other with pneuma and theos is
   not incompatible with the latter, which is, moreover, supported by the
   constant insistance on God having come, en sarki and en homoiomati
   anthropou. The anthropos teleios of Â§8 and the homoiothe kata panta of
   Â§11 lose their edge in the context of those passages. The first part of
   Â§7 could scarcely have been written by an earnest opponent of
   Apollinarianism. This evidence is not conclusive, but it is worth
   considering, and, at any rate, leaves it very difficult to meet the
   strong negative case against the genuineness of the Tract. (Best
   discussion of the latter in Bright, Later Treatises of St. A., p. 143;
   he is supported by Card. Newman in a private letter.)

   (37) The Sermo Maior de Fide. (Migne xxvi. 1263 sqq., with an
   additional fragment p. 1292 from Mai Bibl. nov.). This is a puzzling
   document in many ways. It has points of contact with the earliest works
   of Ath. (especially pieces nearly verbatim from the de Incarn., see
   notes there), also with the Expos. Fid. Card. Newman calls it with some
   truth Hardly more than a set of small fragments from Ath.'s other
   works.' However this may be, it is quoted by Theodoret as Athanasian
   more than once. The peculiarity lies in the constant iteration of
   Anthropos for the Lord's human nature (see note on Exp. Fid.), and in
   some places as though it were merely the equivalent to soma or sarx,
   while in others the Anthropos might be taken as the seat of Personality
   (26, 32). Accordingly the tract might be taken advantage of either by
   Nestorians, or still more by Apollinarians. The syllogistic method,'
   praised in the work by Montfaucon, was not unknown to the
   last-mentioned school. (Prov. viii. 22 is explained in the Athanasian
   way. For a fuller discussion, result unfavourable, see Bright, ubi
   supr. p. 145.)

   (38) Fragments against Paul of Samosata, Macedonians, Novatians (Migne
   xxvi. 1293, 1313-1317). The first of these may well be genuine. It
   repeats the (mistaken) statement of Hist. Ar. 71, that Zenobia was a
   Jewess. Of the second, all that can be said is that it attacks the
   Macedonians in language borrowed from Ep. Ã†g. 11. The third, consisting
   of a somewhat larger group of five fragments, comprise a short sentence
   comparing the instrumentality of the priest in absolving to his
   instrumentality in baptizing.

   It may be observed that fragments of this brevity rarely furnish a
   decisive criterion of genuineness.

   (39) Interpretatio Symboli (ib. 1232, Hahn, Â§66). Discussed fully by
   Caspari, Ungedruckte u.s.w. Quellen i. pp. 1-72, and proved to be an
   adaptation of a baptismal creed drawn up by Epiphanius (Ancor. ad fin.)
   in 374. It may be Alexandrian, and, if so, by Bishop Peter or
   Theophilus about 380. It is a Ermeneia, or rather an expansion, of the
   Nicene, not as Montf. says, of the Apostles'(!), Creed.

   (40) De Incarnatione Verbi Dei (Migne xxviii. 25-29). Quoted as
   Athanasian by Cyril of Alex., &c., and famous as containing the phrase
   Mian phusin tou Logou sesarkomenen Apollinarian; one of the many
   forgeries from this school circulated under the names of Athanasius,
   Gregory Thaumaturgus, Julius, &c. See Caspari, ubi supra 151, Loofs,
   Leontius, p. 82, sqq. Caspari's proof is full and conclusive. See also
   Hahn, Â§120.

   (41) Verona Creed (Hahn, Â§41, q.v.), a Latin fragment of a Western
   creed; nothing Athanasian but the ms. title.

   (42) Damasine' Creed (Opp. ed. Ben. ii. 626, Migne P.L lxii. 237 in
   Vig. Thaps.) forms the eighth' of the Libri de Trinitate ascribed now
   to Athan. now to Damasus, &c., &c.: see Hahn, Â§128 and note.

   (43) de Incarnatione' (Migne xxviii. 89), Anti-Nestorian: fifth
   century.

   c. Historical, or historico-polemical (6, 8-10, 13-19, 23).

   (44) Fragment concerning Stephen and the Envoys at Antioch (Migne xxvi.
   1293). Closely related (relative priority not clear) to the account in
   Thdt. H. E., ii. 9.

   d. Apologetic. To this class belong only the works under No. (1).

   e. Exegetical (5). The other exegetical works attributed to Athan. are
   mainly in Migne, vol. xxvii.

   (45) Ad Marcellinum de Interpretatione Psalmorum. Certainly genuine. A
   thoughtful and devout tract on the devotional use of the Psalter. He
   lays stress on its universality, as summing up the spirit of all the
   other elements of Scripture, and as applying to the spiritual needs of
   every soul in all conditions. He remarks that the Psalms are sung not
   for musical effect, but that the worshippers may have longer time to
   dwell upon their meaning. The whole is presented as the discourse tinos
   philoponou gerontos, possibly an ideal character.

   (46) Expositiones in Psalmos, with an Argumentum (hupothesis) prefixed.
   The latter notices the arrangement of the Hebrew Psalter, the division
   into books, &c., and accounts for the absence of logical order by the
   supposition that during the Captivity some prophet collected as best he
   could the Scriptures which the carelessness of the Israelites had
   allowed to fall into disorder. The titles are to be followed as regards
   authorship. Imprecatory passages relate to our ghostly enemies. In the
   Expositions each Psalm is prefaced by a short statement of the general
   subject. He occasionally refers to the rendering of Aquila, Theodotion,
   and Symmachus.

   (47) Fragmenta in Psalmos. Published by Felckmann from the Catena of
   Nicetas Heracleota, who has used his materials somewhat freely, often
   combining the comments of more than one Father into a single whole.

   (48) De Titulis Psalmorum. First published by Antonelli in 1746. This
   work, consisting of very brief notes on the Psalter verse by verse, is
   spoken of disparagingly by Alzog, Patrol., p. 229, and regarded as
   spurious, on good prima facie grounds, by Gwatkin, p. 69, note.
   Eichhorn, de Vit. Ascet., p. 43, note, threatens the latter (1886) with
   a refutation which, however, I have not seen.

   (49) Fragmentum in Cantica. (Photius mentions a Commentary on Eccles.
   and Cant.) From a Catena published by Meursius in 1617. Very brief (on
   Cant. i. 6, 7, iii. 1, 2, vi. 1). A spurious homily is printed (pp.
   1349-1361) as an appendix to it.

   (50) Fragmenta in Evang. MatthÃ¦i. Also from ms. catenÃ¦. Contain a
   remarkable reference to the Eucharist (p. 1380, on Matt. vii. 6) and a
   somewhat disparaging reference to Origen (infr. p. 33) in reference to
   Matt. xii. 32, which passage is explained as in Serap. iv. (vide supra
   22). The extracts purport in some cases to be taken from a homiletical
   or expository work of Athanasius divided into separate logoi. The
   passage on the nine incurable diseases of Herod' is grotesque (Migne
   xxvi. 1252), but taken from Joseph., B. J. I. xxiii. 5. Cf. Euseb. H.
   E. i. 8.

   (51) Fragmenta in Lucam. Also from ms. catenÃ¦. At the end, a remarkable
   passage on the extent to which prayers can help the departed.

   (52) Fragmenta in Job. From Nicetas and ms. catenÃ¦. Contains little
   remarkable. Behemoth' is Satan, as elsewhere in Athan.

   (53) Fragmentum in I. Cor. A short paragraph on 1 Cor. vii. 1, or
   rather on vi. 18, somewhat inadequately explained.

   f. Moral and Ascetic, (11-13, [25], 28).

   (54) Sermo de Patientia. (Migne xxvi. 1295.) Of doubtful genuineness
   (Montf., Gwatkin).

   (55) De Virginitate. (Migne xxviii. 251). Pronounced dubious by Montf.,
   spurious by Gwatkin, genuine by Eichhorn (ubi supr., pp. 27, sqq.), who
   rightly lays stress on the early stage of feminine asceticism which is
   implied. But I incline to agree with Mr. Gwatkin as to its claims to
   come from Athanasius. Three hypostases' are laid down in a way
   incompatible with Athanasius' way of speaking in later life.

   (56) Miscellaneous Fragments. These are too slight and uncertain to be
   either classed or discussed here. De Amuletis (xxvi. 1319); de Azymis,
   (1327), very dubious; In Ramos palmarum (1319), also dubious; various
   small homiletical and controversial pieces (pp. 1224-1258) of various
   value and claims to genuineness. (See also Migne xxv. p. xiv. No. xx.)

   (57) Of Lost Works (in addition to those of which fragments have been
   mentioned above) a Refutation of Arianism is referred to in Letter 52.
   We also hear of a treatise against heresies (a fragment above, No. 56).
   A Synodicon,' with the names of all Bishops present at NicÃ¦a, is quoted
   by Socr. i. 13, but is referred by Revillout to his alleged Acts of the
   Synod of Alexandria in 362, which he supposes to have reissued the Acts
   of NicÃ¦a. See above, p. lix. A consolatory address to the Virgins
   maltreated by George is mentioned by Theodoret, H. E. ii. 14; he quotes
   a few words, referring to the fact that the Arians would not even allow
   them peaceable burial, but sit about the tombs like demons' to prevent
   it. The Oratio de defunctis (infra, ch. iv. Â§6, fragment above, 56) is
   ascribed to him by John Damasc., but by others to Cyril of Alexandria.
   Many of his letters must have been lost. The Festal Letters are still
   very incomplete, and his letters to S. Basil would be a welcome
   discovery if they exist anywhere. A doctrinal letter against the
   Arians, not preserved to us, is mentioned de Decr. 5. (See also
   Montfaucon's PrÃ¦f. ii. (Migne xxv. p. xxv., sqq), and Jerome, de Vir.
   illustr. 87, a somewhat careless and scanty list.)

   The above enumeration includes all the writings attributed with any
   probability to S. Athanasius. The fragmentary character of many of them
   is no great presumption against their genuineness. The Abbat Cosmas in
   the sixth century advised all who met with anything by Athanasius to
   copy it, and if they had no paper, to use their clothes for the
   purpose. This will readily explain (if explanation is needed) the
   transmission of such numerous scraps of writing under the name of the
   great bishop. It will also partly explain the large body of Spurious
   Works which have sheltered themselves under his authority. To this
   class we have already assigned several writings (25, 36, 37? 39-43, 44?
   48? 53? 55, 56 in part). Others whose claims are even less strong may
   be passed over, with only the mention of one or two of the more
   important. They are all printed in Migne, vol. xxviii., and parallels
   to some, especially the dubious' In passionem et crucem Domini, are
   marked in Williams' notes to the Festal Letters, partly incorporated in
   this volume. The epistola catholica and Synopsis ScripturÃ¦ sacrÃ¦ are
   among the better known, and are classed with a few others as dubia' by
   Montfaucon, the fictitious Disputatio habita in concilio NicÃ¦no contra
   Arium, among the spuria.' The silly tale de Imagine Berytensi seems to
   have enjoyed a wide circulation in the middle ages. Of the other
   undoubtedly spurious' works the most famous is the Athanasian Creed' or
   Quicunque Vult. It is needless to say that it is unconnected with
   Athanasius: its origin is still sub judice. The second part of it bears
   traces of the period circa 430 a.d., and the question which still
   awaits a last word is whether the Symbol is or is not a fusion of two
   originally independent documents. Messrs. Lumby, Swainson and others
   have ably maintained this, but the difficulties of their hypothesis
   that the fusion took place as late as about 800 a.d. are very great,
   and I incline to think will eventually prove fatal to it. But the
   discussion does not belong to our present subject.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§2. Athanasius as an Author. Style and Characteristics.

   Athanasius was not an author by choice. With the exception of the early
   apologetic tracts all the writings that he has left were drawn from him
   by the stress of theological controversy or by the necessities of his
   work as a Christian pastor. We have no systematic doctrinal treatise,
   no historical monograph from his pen, although his writings are rich in
   materials for history and dogmatics alike. The exception to this is in
   the exegetical remains, especially those on the Psalms, which (supra,
   No. 45, sqq.) imply something more than occasional work, some intention
   of systematic composition. For this, a work congenial to one who was
   engaged in preaching, his long intervals of quiet at Alexandria
   (especially 328-335, 346-356, 365-373) may well have given him leisure.
   But on the whole, his writings are those of a man of powerful mind
   indeed and profound theological training, but still of a man of action.
   The style of Athanasius is accordingly distinguished from that of many
   older and younger contemporaries (Eusebius, Gregory Naz., &c.) by its
   inartificiality. This was already observed by Erasmus, who did not know
   many of his best works, but who notes his freedom from the harshness of
   Tertullian, the exaggeration of Jerome, the laboured style of Hilary,
   the overloaded manner of Augustine and Chrysostom, the imitation of the
   Attic orators so conspicuous in Gregory; sed totus est in explicanda
   re.' That is true. Athanasius never writes for effect, but merely to
   make his meaning plain and impress it on others. This leads to his
   principal fault, namely his constant self-repetition (see p. 47, note
   6); even in apologising for this he repeats the offence. The praise by
   Photius (quoted below, Introd. to Orat.) of his aperitton seems to
   apply to his freedom not from repetition but from extravagance, or
   studied brilliancy. This simplicity led Philostorgius, reflecting the
   false taste of his age, to pronounce Athanasius a child as compared
   with Basil, Gregory, or Apollinarius. To a modern reader the manliness
   of his character is reflected in the unaffected earnestness of his
   style. Some will admire him most when, in addressing a carefully
   calculated appeal to an emperor, he models his periods on Demosthenes
   de Corona (see p. 237). To others the unrestrained utterance of the
   real man, in such a gem of feeling and character as the Letter (p. 557)
   to Dracontius, will be worth more than any studied apology. With all
   his occasional repetition, with all the feebleness of the Greek
   language of that day as an instrument of expression, if we compare it
   with the Greek of Thucydides or Plato, Athanasius writes with nerve and
   keenness, even with a silent but constant underflow of humour. His
   style is not free from Latinisms; preda (= prÃ¦da) in the Encycl.,
   beteranos (= veteranus), belon (= velum), magistros, &c., are
   barbarisms belonging to the later decadence of Greek, but not without
   analogy even in the earliest Christian Literature. xunoris is used in
   an unusual sense, p. 447. 'Areiomanitai seems to be coined by himself;
   akathekon, apoxenizein, epakouein (= answer), enkuklein, &c., are
   Alexandrinisms (see Fialon, p. 289). On the whole, no man was ever less
   of a stylist, while at the same time making the fullest use of the
   resources furnished by the language at his command. When he wrote,
   seven centuries of decay had passed over the language of Thucydides,
   the tragedians, Plato and the Orators. The Latin Fathers of the day had
   at their disposal a language only two centuries or so past its prime.
   The heritage of Thucydides had passed through Tacitus to the Latin
   prose writers of the silver age. The Latin of Tertullian, Cyprian,
   Jerome, Augustin, Leo, with all its mannerisms and often false
   antithesis and laboured epigram, was yet a terse incisive weapon
   compared with the patristic Greek. But among the Greek Fathers
   Athanasius is the most readable, simply because his style is natural
   and direct, because it reflects the man rather than the age.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§3. Personal characteristics (see Stanley's Eastern Church, Lect.
   vii.).

   To write an elaborate character of Athanasius is superfluous. The full
   account of his life (chap. ii.), and the specimens of his writings in
   this volume, may be trusted to convey the right impression without the
   aid of analysis. But it may be well to emphasise one or two salient
   points. [88]

   In Athanasius we feel ourselves in contact with a commanding
   personality. His early rise to decisive epoch-making influence,--he was
   scarcely more than 27 at the council of NicÃ¦a,--his election as bishop
   when barely of canonical age, the speedy ascendancy which he gained
   over all Egypt and Libya, the rapid consolidation of the distracted
   province under his rule, the enthusiastic personal loyalty of his
   clergy and monks, the extraordinary popularity enjoyed by him at
   Alexandria even among the heathen (excepting, perhaps, the more
   abandoned among them,' Hist. Ar. 58), the evident feeling of the Arians
   that as long as he was intact their cause could not prosper, the
   jealously of his influence shewn by Constantius and Julian, all this is
   a combined and impressive tribute to his personal greatness. In what
   then did this consist?

   Principally, no doubt, in his moral and mental vigour; resolute ability
   characterises his writings and life throughout. He had the not too
   common gift of seeing the proportions of things. A great crisis was
   fully appreciated by him; he always saw at once where principles
   separated or united men, where the bond or the divergence was merely
   accidental. With Arius and Arianism no compromise was to be thought of;
   but he did not fail to distinguish men really at one with him on
   essentials, even where their conduct toward himself had been
   indefensible (de Syn.). So long as the cause was advanced, personal
   questions were insignificant. So far Athanasius was a partisan. It may
   be admitted that he saw little good in his opponents; but unless the
   evidence is singularly misleading there was little good to see. The
   leaders of the Arian interest were unscrupulous men, either bitter and
   unreasoning fanatics like Secundus and Maris, or more often political
   theologians, like Eusebius of Nicomedia, Valens, Acacius, who lacked
   religious earnestness. It may be admitted that he refused to admit
   error in his friends. His long alliance with Marcellus, his unvarying
   refusal to utter a syllable of condemnation of him by name; his refusal
   to name even Photinus, while yet (Orat. iv.) exposing the error
   associated with his name; his suppression of the name of Apollinarius,
   even when writing directly against him; all this was inconsistent with
   strict impartiality, and, no doubt, placed his adversaries partly in
   the right. But it was the partiality of a generous and loyal spirit,
   and he could be generous to personal enemies if he saw in them an
   approximation to himself in principle. When men were dead, unlike too
   many theologians of his own and later times, he restrained himself in
   speaking of them, even if the dead man were Arius himself.

   In the whole of our minute knowledge of his life there is a total lack
   of self-interest. The glory of God and the welfare of the Church
   absorbed him fully at all times. We see the immense power he exercised
   in Egypt; the Emperors recognised him as a political force of the first
   order; Magnentius bid for his support, Constantius first cajoled, then
   made war upon him; but on no occasion does he yield to the temptation
   of using the arm of flesh. Almost unconscious of his own power, he
   treats Serapion and the monks as equals or superiors, begging them to
   correct and alter anything amiss in his writings. His humility is the
   more real for never being conspicuously paraded.

   Like most men of great power, he had a real sense of humour (Stanley,
   p. 231, sq., ed. 1883). Even in his youthful works we trace it (infr.
   p. 2), and it is always present, though very rarely employed with
   purpose. But the exposure of the Arsenius calumny at Tyre, the smile
   with which he answered the importunate catechising of an Epiphanius
   about old' Marcellus, the oracular interpretation of the crow's cras'
   in answer to the heathen (Sozom. iv. 10), the grave irony with which he
   often confronts his opponents with some surprising application of
   Scripture, his reply to the pursuers from the Nile boat in 362, allow
   us to see the twinkle of his keen, searching eye. Courage,
   self-sacrifice, steadiness of purpose, versatility and resourcefulness,
   width of ready sympathy, were all harmonised by deep reverence and the
   discipline of a single-minded lover of Christ. The Arian controversy
   was to him no battle for ecclesiastical power, nor for theological
   triumph. It was a religious crisis involving the reality of revelation
   and redemption. He felt about it as he wrote to the bishops of Egypt,
   we are contending for our all' (p. 234).

   A certain cloud of romance encircled him' (Reynolds). His escapes from
   Philagrius, Syrianus, Julian, his secret presence in Alexandria, his
   life among the monasteries of Egypt in his third exile, his reputed
   visits to distant councils, all impress the imagination and lend
   themselves to legend and fable. Later ages even claimed that he had
   fled in disguise to Spain and served as cook in a monastery near
   Calahorra (Act. SS. 2 Maii)! But he is also surrounded by an atmosphere
   of truth. Not a single miracle of any kind is related of him. To invest
   him with the halo of miracle the Bollandists have to come down to the
   translation' of his body, not to Constantinople (an event surrounded
   with no little uncertainty), but to Venice, whither a thievish
   sea-captain, who had stolen it from a church in Stamboul, brought a
   body, which decisively proved its identity by prodigies which left no
   room for doubt. But the Athanasius of history is not the subject of any
   such tales. It has been said that no saint outside the New Testament
   has ever claimed the gift of miracles for himself. At any rate (though
   he displays credulity with regard to Antony), the saintly reputation of
   Athanasius rested on his life and character alone, without the aid of
   any reputation for miraculous power.

   And resting upon this firm foundation, it has won the respect and
   admiration even of those who do not feel that they owe to him the
   vindication of all that is sacred and precious. Not only a Gregory or
   an Epiphanius, an Augustine or a Cyril, a Luther or a Hooker, not only
   Montfaucon and Tillemont, Newman and Stanley pay tribute to him as a
   Christian hero. Secular as well as Church historians fall under the
   spell of his personality, and even Gibbon lays aside his solemn sneer'
   to do homage to Athanasius the great.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [88] Of his personal appearance little is known. Gregory Naz. praises
   his beauty of expression, Julian sneers at his small stature. Later
   tradition adds a slight stoop, a hooked nose and small mouth, short
   beard spreading into large whiskers, and light auburn hair, (See
   Stanley ubi supr).

   Chapter IV.

   The Theology of S. Athanasius

   Â§1. General Considerations.

   The theological training of Athanasius was in the school of Alexandria,
   and under the still predominant although modified influence of Origen
   (see above, pp. xiv., xxvii.). The resistance which the theology of
   that famous man had everywhere encountered had not availed, in the
   Greek-speaking churches of the East, to stem its influence; at the same
   time it had made its way at the cost of much of its distinctive
   character. Its principal opponent, Methodius, who represented the
   ancient Asiatic tradition, was himself not uninfluenced by the theology
   he opposed. The legacy of his generation to the Nicene age was an
   Origenism tempered in various degrees by the Asiatic theology and by
   accommodations to the traditional canon of ecclesiastical teaching. The
   degrees of this modification were various, and the variety was
   reflected in the indeterminate body of theological conviction which we
   find at the time of the outbreak of Arianism, and which, as already
   explained, lies at the basis of the reaction against the definition of
   NicÃ¦a. The theology of Alexandria remained Origenist, and the Origenist
   character is purest and most marked in Pierius, Theognostus, and in the
   non-episcopal heads of the Alexandrian School. The bishops of
   Alexandria after Dionysius represent a more tempered Origenism.
   Especially this holds good of the martyred Peter, whom we find
   expressly correcting distinctive parts of the system of his spiritual
   ancestor. In Alexander of Alexandria, the theological sponsor of the
   young Athanasius, the combination of a fundamentally Origenist theology
   with ideas traceable to the Asiatic tradition is conspicuous [89] .

   Athanasius, then, received his first theological ideas from Origenist
   sources, and in so far as he eventually diverged from Origen we must
   seek the explanation partly in his own theological or religious
   idiosyncrasy and in the influences which he encountered as time went
   on, partly in the extent to which the Origenism of his masters was
   already modified by different currents of theological influence.

   To work out this problem satisfactorily would involve a separate
   treatise and a searching study, not only of Athanasius [90] but on the
   one hand of Origen and his school, on the other of Methodius and the
   earlier pre-Nicene theologians. What is here attempted is the more
   modest task of briefly drawing attention to some of the more
   conspicuous evidences of the process and to some of its results in the
   developed theology of the saintly bishop.

   It has been said by Harnack that the theology of Athanasius underwent
   no development, but was the same from first to last. The truth of this
   verdict is I think limited by the fact that the Origenism of Athanasius
   distinctly undergoes a change, or rather fades away, in his later
   works. A non-Origenist element is present from the first, and after the
   contest with Arianism begins, Origen's ideas recede more and more from
   view. Athanasius was influenced negatively by the stress of the Arian
   controversy: while the vague and loose Origenism of the current Greek
   theology inclined the majority of bishops to dread Sabellianism rather
   than Arianism, and to underrate the danger of the latter (pp. xviii.,
   xxxv.), Athanasius, deeply impressed, from personal experience, with
   the negation of the first principles of redemption which Arianism
   involved, stood apart from the first from the theology of his Asiatic
   contemporaries and went back to the authority of Scripture and the Rule
   of Faith. He was influenced positively by the Nicene formula, which
   represents the combination of Western with anti-Origenist Eastern
   traditions in opposition to the dominant Eastern theology. The Nicene
   formula found in Athanasius a mind predisposed to enter into its
   spirit, to employ in its defence the richest resources of theological
   and biblical training, of spiritual depth and vigour, of
   self-sacrificing but sober and tactful enthusiasm; its victory in the
   East is due under God to him alone.

   Athanasius was not a systematic theologian: that is he produced no
   many-sided theology like that of Origen or Augustine. He had no
   interest in theological speculation, none of the instincts of a
   schoolman or philosopher. His theological greatness lies in his firm
   grasp of soteriological principles, in his resolute subordination of
   everything else, even the formula homoousios, to the central fact of
   Redemption, and to what that fact implied as to the Person of the
   Redeemer. He goes back from the Logos of the philosophers to the Logos
   of S. John, from the God of the philosophers to God in Christ
   reconciling the world to Himself. His legacy to later ages has been
   felicitously compared (Harnack, Dg. ii. 26, note) to that of the
   Christian spirit of his age in the realm of architecture. To the many
   forms of architectural conception which lived in Rome and Alexandria in
   the fourth century, the Christian spirit added nothing fresh. Its
   achievement was of a different kind. Out of the many it selected and
   consecrated one; the multiplicity of forms it carried back to a single
   dominant idea, not so much by a change in the spirit of the art as by
   the restoration of Religion to its place as the central motive. It
   bequeathed to the art of the middle ages the Basilica, and rendered
   possible the birth of Gothic, a style, like that of the old Greek
   Temple, truly organic. What the Basilica was in the history of the
   material, the central idea of Athanasius has been in that of the
   spiritual fabric; an auspicious reduction, full of promise for the
   future, of the exuberant speculation of Greek theology to the one idea
   in which the power of religion then resided' (ib. and pp. 22 sqq.,
   freely reproduced).

   [89] To begin with, we have the interesting fact that Alexander studied
   the writings of Melito of Sardis, and even worked up his tract peri
   psuches kai somatos eis to pathos into a homiletical discourse of his
   own, omitting such passages as seemed to savour of modalism,' (see
   KrÃ¼ger in Zeitschr. f. wiss. Theol. 1888, p. 434, sqq.: his grounds are
   convincing). Secondly, the expressions attributed to him by Arius (in
   his letter to Euseb. Nic.), and his letter to his namesake of
   Byzantium, bear out the above statement.

   [90] The reader is requested to supplement the necessarily very slender
   treatment of the Athanasian theology in this chapter by referring to
   the General Index to this volume, as well as to the Index of Texts, for
   guidance to the passages of Athanasius which are needed to check, fill
   out, and qualify what is here presented only in broad outline.

   Â§2. Fundamental ideas of man and his redemption.

   To Athanasius the Incarnation of the Son of God, and especially his
   Death on the Cross, is the centre of faith and theology (Incar. 19,
   kephalaion tes pisteos, cf. 9. 1 and 2, 20. 2, &c.). For our salvation'
   (Incar. 1) the Word became Man and died. But how did Athanasius
   conceive of salvation'? from what are we saved, to what destiny does
   salvation bring us, and what idea does he form of the efficacy of the
   Saviour's death? Now it is not too much to say that no one age of the
   Church's existence has done full justice to the profundity and
   manysidedness of the Christian idea of Redemption as effected in Christ
   and as unfolded by S. Paul. The kingdom of God and His Righteousness;
   the forgiveness of sins and the adoption of sons as a present gift; the
   consummation of all at the great judgment;--Christian men of different
   ages, countries, characters and mental antecedents, while united in
   personal devotion to the Saviour and in the sanctifying Power of His
   Grace, have interpreted these central ideas of the Gospel in terms of
   their own respective categories, and have succeeded in bringing out now
   one, now another aspect of the mystery of Redemption rather than in
   preserving the balance of the whole. Who will claim that the last word
   has yet been said on S. Paul's deep conception of God's (not mercy but)
   Righteousness as the new and peculiar element (Rom. i. 17, iii. 22, 26)
   of the Gospel Revelation? to search out the unsearchable riches of
   Christ is the prerogative of Christian faith, but is denied, save to
   the most limited extent, to Christian knowledge (1 Cor. xiii. 9). The
   onesidedness of any given age in apprehending the work of Christ is to
   be recognised by us not in a censorious spirit of self-complacency, but
   with reverent sympathy, and with the necessity in view of correcting
   our own: panta dokimazete, to kalon katechete.

   Different ages and classes have necessarily thought under different
   categories. The categories of the post-apostolic age were mainly
   ethical; the Gospel is the new law, and the promise of eternal life,
   founded on true knowledge of God, and accepted by faith. Those of the
   Asiatic fathers from Ignatius downwards were largely physical or
   realistic. Mankind is brought in Christ (the physician) from death to
   life, from phthora to aphtharsia (Ign. passim); to
   euangelion...apartisma aphtharsias (Ign., Melit.); human nature is
   changed by the Incarnation, man made God. Tertullian introduced into
   Western theology forensic categories. He applied them to the Person,
   not yet to the Work, of Christ: but the latter application, pushed to a
   repellent length in the middle ages, and still more so since the
   Reformation, may without fancifulness be traced back to the fact that
   the first Latin Father was a lawyer. Again, Redemption was viewed by
   Origen and others under cosmological categories, as the turning point
   in the great conflict of good with evil, of demons with God, as the
   inauguration of the deliverance of the creation and its reunion with
   God. The many-sidedness of Origen combined, indeed, almost every
   representation of Redemption then current, from the propitiatory and
   mediatorial, which most nearly approached the thought of S. Paul, to
   the grotesque but widely-spread view of a ransom due to the devil which
   he was induced to accept by a stratagem. It may be said that with the
   exception of the last-named every one of the above conceptions finds
   some point of contact in the New Testament; even the forensic idea,
   thoroughly unbiblical in its extremer forms, would not have influenced
   Christian thought as it has done had it not corresponded to something
   in the language of S. Paul.

   Now Athanasius does not totally ignore any one of these conceptions,
   unless it be that of a transaction with the devil, which he scarcely
   touches even in Orat. ii. 52 (see note there). Of the forensic view he
   is indeed almost clear. His reference to the debt' (to opheilomenon,
   Incar. 20, Orat. ii. 66) which had to be paid is connected not so much
   with the Anselmic idea of a satisfaction due, as with the fact that
   death was by the divine word (Gen. iii.), attached to sin as its
   penalty.

   The aspect of the death of Christ as a vicarious sacrifice (anti
   panton, de Incar. 9; prosphora and thusia, 10) is not passed over. But
   on the whole another aspect predominates. The categories under which
   Athanasius again and again states the soteriological problem are those
   of zoe and thanatos, and aphtharsia. So far as he works the problem out
   in detail it is under physical categories, without doing full justice
   to the ideas of guilt and reconciliation, of the reunion of will
   between man and God. The numberless passages which bear this out cannot
   be quoted in full, but the point is of sufficient importance to demand
   the production of a few details.

   (a) The original state of man was not one of nature,' for man's nature
   is phthora; (ten en thanato kata phusin phthoran, Incar. 3, cf. 8, 10,
   44) the Word was imparted to them in that they were made kata ten tou
   theou eikona (ib). Hence what later theology marks off as an
   exclusively supernatural gift is according to Athanasius inalienable
   from human nature, i.e. it can be impaired but not absolutely lost
   (Incar. 14, and apparently Orat. iii. 10 fin.; the question of the
   teaching of Athan. upon the natural endowments of man belongs specially
   to the Introd. to de Incarnatione, where it will be briefly discussed).
   Accordingly their infraction of the divine command (by turning their
   minds, c. Gent. 3, to lower things instead of to the theoria ton
   theion), logically involved them in non-existence (de Incar. 4), but
   actually, inasmuch as the likeness of God was only gradually lost, in
   phthora, regarded as a process toward non-existence. This again
   involved men in increasing ignorance of God, by the gradual
   obliteration of the eikon, the indwelling Logos, by virtue of which
   alone men could read the open book (c. Gent. 34 fin.) of God's
   manifestation of Himself in the Universe. It is evident that the
   pathological point of view here prevails over the purely ethical: the
   perversion of man's will merges in the general idea of phthora, the
   first need of man is a change in his nature; or rather the renewed
   infusion of that higher and divine nature which he has gradually lost.
   (Cf. de Incar. 44, chrezonton tes autou theotetos dia tou homoiou).

   (b) Accordingly the mere presence of the Word in a human body, the mere
   fact of the Incarnation, is the essential factor in our restoration
   (simile of the city and the king, ib. 9. 3, &c., cf. Orat. ii. 67, 70).
   But if so, what was the special need of the Cross? Athanasius felt, as
   we have already mentioned, the supremacy of the Cross as the purpose of
   the Saviour's coming, but he does not in fact give to it the central
   place in his system of thought which it occupies in his instincts. Man
   had involved himself in the sentence of death; death must therefore
   take place to satisfy this sentence (Orat. ii. 69; de Incar. 20. 2, 5);
   the Saviour's death, then, put an end to death regarded as penal and as
   symptomatic of man's phthora (cf. ib. 21. 1, &c.). It must be confessed
   that Athanasius does not penetrate to the full meaning of S. Paul. The
   latter also ascribed a central import to the mere fact of the
   Incarnation (Rom. viii. 3, pempsas), but primarily in relation to sin
   (yet see Athan. c. Apoll. ii. 6); and the destruction of the practical
   power of sin stands indissolubly correlated (Rom. viii. 1) with the
   removal of guilt and so with the Righteousness of God realising itself
   in the propitiation of the blood of Christ (ib. iii. 21--26).

   To Athanasius nature is the central, will a secondary or implied factor
   in the problem. The aspect of the death of Christ most repeatedly dwelt
   upon is that in it death spent its force (plerotheises tes exousias en
   to kuriako souati, ib. 8) against human nature, that the corruption' of
   mankind might run its full course and be spent in the Lord's body, and
   so cease for the future. Of this Victory over death and the demons the
   Resurrection is the trophy. His death is therefore to us (ib. 10) the
   arche zoes, we are henceforth aphthartoi dia tes anastaseos (27. 2, 32.
   6, cf. 34. 1, &c.), and have a portion in the divine nature, are in
   fact deified (cf. de Incarn. 54, and note there). This last thought,
   which became (Harnack, vol. ii. p. 46) the common property of Eastern
   theology, goes back through Origen and Hippolytus to IrenÃ¦us. On the
   whole, its presentation in Athanasius is more akin to the Asiatic than
   to the Origenist form of the conception. To Origen, man's highest
   destiny could only be the return to his original source and condition:
   to IrenÃ¦us and the Asiatics, man had been created for a destiny which
   he had never realised; the interruption in the history of our race
   introduced by sin was repaired by the Incarnation, which carried back
   the race to a new head, and so carried it forward to a destiny of which
   under its original head it was incapable. To Origen the Incarnation was
   a restoration to, to IrenÃ¦us and to Athanasius (Or. ii. 67), an advance
   upon, the original state of man. (Pell, pp. 167-177, labours to prove
   the contrary, but he does not convince.)

   (c) This leads us to the important observation that momentous as are to
   Athanasius the consequences of the introduction of sin into the world,
   he yet makes no such vast difference between the condition of fallen
   and unfallen men as has commonly been assumed to exist. The latter
   state was inferior to that of the members of Christ (Orat. ii. 67, 68),
   while the immense (c. Gent. 8, de Incar. 5) consequences of its
   forfeiture came about only by a gradual course of deterioration (de
   Incar. 6. 1, ephanizeto; observe the tense), and in different degrees
   in different cases. The only difference of kind between the two
   conditions is in the universal reign of Death since the (partial)
   forfeiture of the tou kat' eikona charis: and even this difference is a
   subtle one; for man's existence in Paradise was not one of aphtharsia
   except prospectively (de Incar. 3. 4). He enjoyed present happiness,
   alupos anodunos amerimnos zoe, with promise of aphtharsia in heaven.
   That is, death would have taken place, but not death as unredeemed
   mankind know it (cf. de Incar. 21. 1). In other words, man was created
   not so much in a state of perfection (teleios ktistheis, p. 384) as
   with a capacity for perfection (and for even more than perfection, p.
   385 sq.) and with a destiny to correspond with such capacity. This
   destination remains in force even after man has failed to correspond to
   it, and is in fact assigned by Athanasius as the reason why the
   Incarnation was a necessity on God's part (de Incar. 6. 4-7, 10. 3, 13.
   2-4, Orat. ii. 66, &c., &c.). Accordingly, while man was created (Orat.
   ii. 59) through the Word, the Word became Flesh that man might receive
   the yet higher dignity of Sonship [91] ; and while even before the
   Incarnation some men were de facto pure from sin (Orat. iii. 33) by
   virtue of the charis tes kleseos involved in to kat' eikona' (see ib.
   10, fin.; Orat. i. 39 is even stronger, cf. iv. 22), they were yet
   thnetoi and phthartoi; whereas those in Christ die, no longer kata ten
   proteran genesin en to 'Adam, but to live again logotheises tes sarkos
   (Orat. iii. 33, fin., cf. de Incar. 21. 1).

   (d) The above slight sketch of the Athanasian doctrine of man's need of
   redemption and of the satisfaction of that need brings to light a
   system free from much that causes many modern thinkers to stumble at
   the current doctrine of the original state and the religious history of
   mankind. That mankind did not start upon their development with a
   perfect nature, but have fought their way up from an undeveloped stage
   through many lower phases of development; that this development has
   been infinitely varied and complex, and that sin and its attendant
   consequences have a pathological aspect which practically is as
   important as the forensic aspect, are commonplaces of modern thought,
   resting upon the wider knowledge of our age, and hard to reconcile with
   the (to us) traditional theological account of these things. The
   Athanasian account of them leaves room for the results of modern
   knowledge, or at least does not rudely clash with the instincts of the
   modern anthropologist. The recovery of the Athanasian point of view is
   prima facie again. At what cost is it obtained? Does its recognition
   involve us in mere naturalism veiled under religious forms of speech?
   That was certainly not the mind of Athanasius, nor does his system
   really lend itself to such a result. To begin with, the divine destiny
   of man from the first is an essential principle with our writer. Man
   was made and is still exclusively destined for knowledge of and
   fellowship with his Creator. Secondly the means, and the only means, to
   this end is Christ the Incarnate Son of God. In Him the religious
   history of mankind has its centre, and from Him it proceeds upon its
   new course, or rather is enabled once more to run the course designed
   for it from the first. How far Athanasius exhausted the significance of
   this fact may be a question; that he placed the fact itself in the
   centre is his lasting service to Christian thought.

   (e) The categories of Athanasius in dealing with the question before us
   are primarily physical, i.e., on the one hand cosmological, on the
   other pathological. But it is well before leaving the subject to insist
   that this was not exclusively the case. The purpose of the Incarnation
   was at once to renew us, and to make known the Father (de Incarn. 16);
   or as he elsewhere puts it (ib. 7 fin.), anaktisai ta hola, huper
   panton, pathein, and peri panton presbeusui pros ton Patera. The idea
   of aphtharsia which so often stands with him for the summum bonum [92]
   imparted to us in Christ, involves a moral and spiritual restoration of
   our nature, not merely the physical supersession of phthora by
   athanasia (de Incarn. 47, 51, 52, &c., &c.).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [91] The above is strikingly illustrated by the discussion (pp.
   381-383) of prototokos pases ktiseos (Col. i. 15). At first sight Ath.
   appears to contradict himself, explaining prototokos as he does first
   solely of the Saviour as Incarnate, and then of the cosmic and creative
   function of the Word. But closer examination brings out his view of
   creation itself (p. 383) as an act of Grace, demanding not (as the
   current Eastern theology held, in common with Arius) the mediation of a
   subordinate Creator, but an act of absolutely Divine condescension
   analogous to, and anticipatory of, the Incarnation. The apparently
   disturbing persistence in the argument of the cosmological explanation
   of prototokos is really therefore due to a subtle change in it, by
   virtue of which it comes into relation with the Soteriological
   idea,--which is the pivot of the entire anti-Arian position of
   Athanasius on this question,--and with the ultimate scheme in which
   (cf. Rom. viii.) the effects of the Incarnation are to embrace the
   whole creation. Because creation as such involves the promise of
   adoption, and tends to deification as its goal, the Son is prototokos
   in the region of Grace and of Creation alike.

   [92] On the subject of Â§2, see also Pell. Lehre des h. Athan. and Shedd
   ii. pp. 37, sqq., 237, sqq. The former demonstrates his full accord
   with modern Roman Catholic teaching, the latter, his exact harmony with
   the modern Protestant view of the doctrine. It is at least a tribute to
   the greatness of Athan. that advocates of all sides are so eager to
   claim him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§3. Fundamental Ideas of God, the World, and Creation.

   The Athanasian idea of God has been singled out for special recognition
   in recent times; he has been claimed, and on the whole with justice, as
   a witness for the immanence of God in the universe in contrast to the
   insistence in many Christian systems on God's transcendence or
   remoteness from all created things. (Fiske, Idea of God, discussed by
   Moore in Lux Mundi (ed. 1) pp. 95-102.) The problem was one which
   Christian thought was decisively compelled to face by the Arian
   controversy (supra, p. xxix. sq.). The Apologists and Alexandrians had
   partially succeeded in the problem expressed in the dying words of
   Plotinus, to bring the God which is within into harmony with the God
   which is in the universe,' or rather to reconcile the transcendence
   with the immanence of God. But their success was only partial: the
   immanence of the Word had been emphasised, but in contrast with the
   transcendence of the Father. This could not be more than a temporary
   resting-place for the Christian mind, and Arius forced a solution. That
   solution was found by Athanasius. The mediatorial work of the Logos is
   not necessary as though nature could not bear the untempered hand of
   the Father. The Divine Will is the direct and sole source of all
   things, and the idea of a mediatorial nature is inconsistent with the
   true idea of God (pp. 87, 155, 362, comparing carefully p. 383). All
   things created are capable of sustaining God's absolute hand. The hand
   which fashioned Adam now also and ever is fashioning and giving entire
   consistence to those who come after him.' The immanence, or intimate
   presence and unceasing agency of God in nature, does not belong to the
   Word as distinct from the Father, but to the Father in and through the
   Word, in a word to God as God (cf. de Decr. 11, where the language of
   de Incarn. 17 about the Word is applied to God as such). This is a
   point which marks an advance upon anything that we find in the earliest
   writings of Athanasius, and upon the theology of his preceptor
   Alexander, to whom, amongst other not very clear formulÃ¦, the Word is a
   mesiteuousa phusis monogenes (Thdt. H. E. ii. 4; Alexander cannot
   distinguish phusis from hupostasis or ousia; Father and Son are duo
   achorista pragmata, but yet te hupostasei duo phuseis). This is indeed
   the principal particular in which Athanasius left the modified
   Origenism of his age, and of his own school, behind. If on the other
   hand he resembled Arius in drawing a sharper line than had been drawn
   previously between the one God and the World, it must also be
   remembered that his God was not the far off purely transcendent God of
   Arius, but a God not far from every one of us (Orat. ii. p. 361 sq.).

   That God is beyond all essence huperekeina pases ousias (c. Gent. 2. 2,
   40. 2, 35. I genetes ousias) is a thought common to Origen and the
   Platonists, but adopted by Athanasius with a difference, marked by the
   addition of genetes. That God created all things out of pure bounty of
   being (c. Gent. Â§2. 2, Â§41. 2, de Incarn. Â§3. 3, and note there) is
   common to Origen and Philo, being taken by the latter from Plato's
   TimÃ¦us. The Universe, and especially the human soul, reflects the being
   of its Author (c. Gent. passim). Hence there are two main paths by
   which man can arrive at the knowledge of God, the book of the Universe
   (c. Gent. 34 fin.), and the contemplation or self-knowledge of the soul
   itself (ib. 33, 34). So far Athanasius is on common ground with the
   Platonists (cf. Fialon, pp. 270, sqq.); but he takes up distinctively
   Christian ground, firstly, in emphasising the insufficiency of these
   proofs after sin has clouded the soul's vision, and, above all, in
   insisting on the divine Incarnation as the sole remedy for this
   inability, as the sole means by which man as he is can reach a true
   knowledge of God. Religion not philosophy is the sphere in which the
   God of Athanasius is manifest to man. Here, again, Athanasius is
   Christo-centric.' With Origen, Athanasius refuses to allow evil any
   substantive existence (c. Gent. Â§Â§2, 6, de Incarn. Â§4. 5); evil resides
   in the will only, and is the result of the abuse of its power of free
   choice (c. Gent. 5 and 7). The evil in the Universe is mainly the work
   of demons, who have aggravated the consequences of human sin also (de
   Incarn. 52. 4). On the other hand, the evil does not extend beyond the
   sphere of personal agency, and the Providence of God (upon which
   Athanasius insists with remarkable frequency, especially in the de Fuga
   and c. Gent. and de Incarn., also in Vit. Anton.) exercises untiring
   care over the whole. The problem of suffering and death in the animal
   creation is not discussed by him; he touches very incidentally, Orat.
   ii. 63, on the deliverance of creation in connection with Rom. viii.
   19-21.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§4. Vehicles of Revelation; Scripture, the Church, Tradition.

   (a) The supreme and unique revelation of God to man is in the Person of
   the Incarnate Son. But though unique the Incarnation is not solitary.
   Before it there was the divine institution of the Law and the Prophets,
   the former a typical anticipation (de Incarn. 40. 2) of the destined
   reality, and along with the latter (ib. 12. 2 and 5) for all the world
   a holy school of the knowledge of God and the conduct of the soul.'
   After it there is the history of the life and teaching of Christ and
   the writings of His first Disciples, left on record for the instruction
   of all ages. Athanasius again and again applies to the Scriptures the
   terms theia and theopneusta (e.g. de Decr. 15, de Incarn. 33. 3, &c.;
   the latter word, which he also applies to his own martyr teachers, is,
   of course, from 2 Tim. iii. 16). The implications of this as bearing on
   the literal exactness of Scripture he nowhere draws out. His strongest
   language (de Decr. ubi supra) is incidental to a controversial point:
   on Ps. lii. (liii.) 2, he maintains that there is no hyperbola in
   Scripture; all is strictly true,' but he proceeds on the strength of
   that principle to allegorise the verse he is discussing. In c. Gent. 2,
   3, he treats the account of Eden and the Fall as figurative. But in his
   later writings there is, so far as I know, nothing to match this. In
   fact, although he always employs the allegorical method, sometimes
   rather strangely (e.g. Deut. xxviii. 66, in de Incarn. 35, Orat. ii.
   19, after IrenÃ¦us, Origen, &c.), we discern, especially in his later
   writings, a tendency toward a more literal exegesis than was usual in
   the Alexandrian school. His discussion, e.g., of the sinlessness of
   Christ (c. Apol. i. 7, 17, ii. 9, 10) contrasts in this respect with
   that of his master Alexander, who appeals, following Origen's somewhat
   startling allegorical application, to Prov. xxx. 19, a text nowhere
   used by Ath. in this way (Thdt. H. E. i. 4). This is doubtless largely
   due to the pressure of the controversy with the Arians, who certainly
   had more to gain than their opponents from the prevalent unhistorical
   methods of exegesis, as we see from the use made by them of 2 Cor. iv.
   11 at NicÃ¦a, and of Prov. viii. 22 throughout [93] . Accordingly
   Athanasius complains loudly of their exegesis (Ep. Ã†g. 3-4, cf. Orat.
   i. 8, 52), and insists (id. i. 54, cf. already de Decr. 14) on the
   primary necessity of always conscientiously studying the circumstances
   of time and place, the person addressed, the subject matter, and
   purpose of the writer, in order not to miss the true sense. This rule
   is the same as applies (de Sent. Dion. 4) to the interpretation of any
   writings whatever, and carries with it the strict subordination of the
   allegorical to the historical sense, contended for by the later school
   of Antioch, and now accepted by all reasonable Christians (see Kihn in
   Wetzer-HergenrÃ¶ther's Kirchen-Lex. vol. i. pp. 955-959, who calls the
   Antiochene exegesis certainly a providential phenomenon;' also supra,
   p. xxviii., note 1).

   (b) The Canon of Scripture accepted by Athanasius has long been known
   from the fragments of the thirty-ninth Festal Letter (Easter, 367). The
   New Testament Canon comprises all the books received at the present
   day, but in the older order, viz., Gospels, Acts, Catholic Epistles,
   Pauline Epistles (Hebrews expressly included as S. Paul's between
   Thess. and Tim.), Apocalypse. The Old Testament canon is remarkable in
   several ways. The number of books is 22, corresponding to the
   Alexandrian Jewish reckoning, not to the (probably) older Jewish or
   Talmudic reckoning of 24 (the rolls of Ruth and Lam. counted
   separately, and with the Hagiographa). This at once excludes from the
   Canon proper the so-called Apocrypha,' with the exception of the
   additions to Daniel, and of Baruch and the Epistle,' which are counted
   as one book with Jeremiah. The latter is also the case with
   Lamentations, while on the other hand the number of 22 is preserved by
   the reckoning of Ruth as a separate book from Judges to make up for the
   exclusion of Esther. This last point is archaic, and brings Athanasius
   into connection with Melito (171 a.d.), who gives (Eus. H. E. iv. 26.
   14, see also vol. 1, p. 144, note 1, in this series) a Canon which he
   has obtained by careful enquiry in Palestine. This Canon agrees with
   that of Athanasius except with regard to the order assigned to Esdras'
   (i.e. Ezra and Nehemiah, placed by M. at the end), to the twelve in one
   book' (placed by M. after Jer.), and Daniel (placed by M. before
   Ezekiel). Now, Esther is nowhere mentioned in the N.T., and the
   Rabbinical discussions as to whether Esther defiled the hands' (i.e.
   was canonical') went on to the time of R. Akiba (135), an older, and
   even of R. Juda the holy' (150-210), a younger, contemporary of Melito
   (see Wildeboer, Ontstaan van den Kanon, pp. 58, sq., 65, &c.). The
   latter, therefore, may represent the penultimate stage in the history
   of the Hebrew canon before its close in the second century, (doubted by
   Bleek, Einl.^5, Â§242, but not unlikely). Here, then, Ath. represents an
   earlier stage of opinion than Origen (Eus. H. E. vi. 25), who gives the
   finally fixed Hebrew Canon of his own time, but puts Esther at the end.
   As to the number of books, Athan. agrees with Josephus, Melito, Origen,
   and with Jerome, who, however, knows of the other reckoning of 24
   (nonnulli' in Prol. Gal.). Athanasius enumerates, as outside the Canon,
   but appointed by the Fathers to be read by those who newly join us,'
   Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Esther, Judith, and Tobit, as well as what is
   called the Teaching of the Apostles and the Shepherd. In practice,
   however, he quotes several of the latter as Scripture' (Wisdom
   repeatedly so, see index to this vol.); The Shepherd' is most
   profitable,' and quoted for the Unity of the Creator (and cf. de Decr.
   4), but not as Scripture;' the Didache' is not used by him unless the
   Syntagma (vide supra, p. lix.) be his genuine work. He also quotes 1
   Esdras for the praise of Truth, and 2 Esdras once, as a prophet.'
   Daniel' includes Susanna and Bel and the Dragon.

   (c) On the sufficiency of Scripture for the establishment of all
   necessary doctrine Athanasius insists repeatedly and emphatically (c.
   Gent. 1, de Incarn. 5, de Decr. 32, Vit. Ant. 16, &c., &c.); and he
   follows up precept by example. His works are a continuous appeal to
   Scripture.' There is no passage in his writings which recognises
   tradition as supplementing Scripture, i.e., as sanctioning articles of
   faith not contained in Scripture. Tradition is recognised as
   authoritative in two ways: (1) Negatively, in the sense that doctrines
   which are novel are prima facie condemned by the very fact (de Decr. 7,
   note 2, ib. 18, Orat. i. 8, 10, ii. 34, 40, de Syn. 3, 6, 7, and Letter
   59, Â§3); and (2) positively, as furnishing a guide to the sense of
   Scripture (see references in note on Orat. iii. 58, end of ch. xxix.).
   In other words, tradition with Athanasius is a formal, not a material,
   source of doctrine. His language exemplifies the necessity of
   distinguishing, in the case of strong patristic utterances on the
   authority of tradition, between different senses of the word. Often it
   means simply truth conveyed in Scripture, and in that sense handed
   down' from the first, as for example c. Apol. i. 22, the Gospel
   tradition,' and Letter 60. 6 (cf. Cypr. Ep. 74. 10, where Scripture is
   divinÃ¦ traditionis caput et origo.'). Moreover, tradition as distinct
   from Scripture is with Athanasius not a secret unwritten body of
   teaching handed down orally [94] , but is to be found in the documents
   of antiquity and the writings of the Fathers, such as those to whom he
   appeals in de Decr., &c. That the appeal of Athanasius was to
   Scripture, that of the Arians to tradition' (Gwatkin) is an
   overstatement, in part supported by the pre-Nicene history of the word
   homoousion (supra, p. xxxi. sq.). The rejection of this word by the
   Antiochene Council (in 268-9) is met by Athanasius, de Synod. 43, sqq.,
   partly by an appeal to still older witnesses in its favour, partly by
   the observation (Â§45) that writing in simplicity [the Fathers] arrived
   not at accuracy concerning the homoousion, but spoke of the word as
   they understood it,' an argument strangely like that of the Homoeans
   (Creed of NikÃ©, ib. Â§30) that the Fathers [of NicÃ¦a] adopted the word
   in simplicity.'

   (d) Connected with the function and authority of tradition is that of
   the Church. On the essential idea of the Church there is little or
   nothing of definite statement. The term Catholic Church' is of course
   commonly used, both of the Church as a whole, and of the orthodox body
   in this or that place. The unity of the Church is emphatically dwelt on
   in the opening of the encyclical written in the name of Alexander
   (infr., p. 69 and supr., p. xvi.) as the reason for communicating the
   deposition of Arius at Alexandria to the Church at large. The joyful
   mother of children' (Exp. in Ps. cxiii. 9) is interpreted of the
   Gentile Church, made to keep house,' hate ton Kurion enoikon echousa,
   joyful because her children are saved through faith in Christ,' whereas
   those of the synagogue' are apolei& 139; paradedomena: the strong city'
   polis perioches and Edom' of Ps. lx. 11 are likewise interpreted of the
   Church as gathered from all nations; similarly the Ethiopians of Ps.
   lxxxvii. 4 (where the de Tit. pss. gives a quite different and more
   allegorical sense, referring the verse to baptism). The full perfection
   of the Church is referred by Athanasius not to the (even ideal) Church
   on earth but to the Church in heaven. The kingdom of God' (Matt. vi.
   33) is explained as the enjoyment of the good things of the future,
   namely the contemplation and knowledge of God so far as man's soul is
   capable of it,' while the city of Ps. lxxxvii. 1-3 is he ano Ierousalem
   in the de Titulis, but in the Expositio the Church glorified by the
   indwelling of the Only-begotten.' In all this we miss any decisive
   utterance as to the doctrinal authority of the Church except in so far
   as the recognition of such authority is involved in what has been cited
   above in favour of tradition. It may be said that the conditions which
   lead the mind to throw upon the Church the weight of responsibility for
   what is believed were absent in the case of Athanasius as indeed in the
   earlier Greek Church generally.

   But Athanasius was far from undervaluing the evidence of the Church's
   tradition. The organ by which the tradition of the Church does its work
   is the teaching function of her officers, especially of the Episcopate
   (de Syn. 3, &c.). But to provide against erroneous teaching on the part
   of bishops, as well as to provide for the due administration of matters
   affecting the Church generally, and for ecclesiastical legislation,
   some authority beyond that of the individual bishop is necessary. This
   necessity is met, in the Church as conceived by Athanasius, in two
   ways, firstly by Councils, secondly in the pre-eminent authority of
   certain sees which exercise some sort of jurisdiction over their
   neighbours. Neither of these resources of Church organisation meets us,
   in Athanasius, in a completely organised shape. A word must be said
   about each separately, then about their correlation.

   (a) Synods. Synods as a part of the machinery of the Church grew up
   spontaneously. The meeting of the Apostles and Elders' at Jerusalem
   (Acts xv.) exemplifies the only way in which a practical resolution on
   a matter affecting a number of persons with independent rights can
   possibly be arrived at, viz., by mutual discussion and agreement. Long
   before the age of Athanasius it had been recognised in the Church that
   the bishops were the persons exclusively entitled to represent their
   flocks for such a purpose; in other words, Councils of bishops had come
   to constitute the legislative and judicial body in the Church (Eus. V.
   C. i. 51). Both of these functions, and especially the latter, involved
   the further prerogative of judging of doctrine, as in the case of Paul
   of Samosata. But the whole system had grown up out of occasional
   emergencies, and no recognised laws existed to define the extent of
   conciliar authority, or the relations between one Council and another
   should their decisions conflict. Not even the area covered by the
   jurisdiction of a given Council was defined (Can. Nic. 5). We see a
   Synod at Arles deciding a case affecting Africa, and reviewing the
   decision of a previous Synod at Rome; a Council at Tyre trying the case
   of a bishop of Alexandria; a Council at Sardica in the West deposing
   bishops in the East, and restoring those whom Eastern Synods had
   deposed; we find Acacius and his fellows deposed at Seleucia, then in a
   few weeks deposing their deposers at Constantinople; Meletius appointed
   and deposed by the same Synod at Antioch in 361, and in the following
   year resuming his see without question. All is chaos. The extent to
   which a Synod succeeds in enforcing its decisions depends on the extent
   to which it obtains de facto recognition. The canons of the Council of
   Antioch (341) are accepted as Church law, while its creeds are
   condemned as Arian (de Syn. 22-25).

   We look in vain for any statement of principle on the part of
   Athanasius to reduce this confusion to order. The classical passage in
   his writings is the letter he has preserved from Julius of Rome to the
   Eastern bishops (Apol. c. Ar. 20-35). The Easterns insist strongly on
   the authority of Councils, in the interests of their deposition of
   Athanasius, &c., at Tyre. Julius can only reply by invoking an
   old-established custom of the Church, ratified, he says, at NicÃ¦a (Can.
   5?), that the decisions of one Council may be revised by another; a
   process which leads to no finality. The Sardican canons of three years
   later drew up, for judicial purposes only, a system of procedure,
   devolving on Julius (or possibly on the Roman bishop for the time
   being) the duty of deciding, upon the initiative of the parties
   concerned, whether in the case of a deposed bishop a new trial of the
   case was desirable, and permitting him to take part in such new trial
   by his deputies. But Athanasius never alludes to any such procedure,
   nor to the canons in question. (Compare above, pp. xlii., xlvi.).

   The absence of any a priori law relating to the authority of Synods
   applies to general as well as to local Councils. The conception of a
   general Council did not give rise to NicÃ¦a, but vice versa (see above,
   p. xvii.). The precedent for great Councils had already been set at
   Antioch (268-9) and Arles (314); the latter in fact seems to be
   indirectly called by S. Augustine plenarium universÃ¦ ecclesiÃ¦
   concilium; but the widely representative character of the Nicene
   Council, and the impressive circumstances under which it met, stamped
   upon it from the first a recognised character of its own. Again and
   again (de Decr. 4, 27, Orat. i. 7, Ep. Ã†g. 5, &c., &c.) Athanasius
   presses the Arians with their rejection of the decision of a
   world-wide' Council, contrasting it (e.g. de Syn. 21) with the numerous
   and indecisive Councils held by them. He protests (Ep. Ã†g. 5, Tom. ad
   Ant., &c.) against the idea that any new creed is necessary or to be
   desired in addition to the Nicene. But in doing so, he does not suggest
   by a syllable that the Council was formally and a priori infallible,
   independently of the character of its decision as faithfully
   corresponding to the tradition of the Apostles. Its authority is
   secondary to that of Scripture (de Syn. 6, sub. fin.), and its
   scriptural character is its justification (ib.). In short, Mr. Gwatkin
   speaks within the mark when he disclaims for Athan. any mechanical
   theory [95] of conciliar infallibility. To admit this candidly is not
   to depreciate, but to acknowledge, the value of the great Synod of
   NicÃ¦a; and to acknowledge it, not on the technical grounds of later
   ecclesiastical law, but on grounds which are those of Athanasius
   himself. (On the general subject see D.C.A. 475-484, and Hatch, B.L.
   vii.)

   (b) Jurisdiction of bishops over bishops. The fully-developed and
   organised patriarchal' system does not meet us in the Nicene age. The
   bishops of important towns, however, exercise a very real, though not
   definable authority over their neighbours. This is especially true of
   Imperial residences. The migration of Eusebius to Nicomedia and
   afterwards to Constantinople broke through the time-honoured rule of
   the Church, but set the precedent commonly followed ever afterwards. In
   Egypt, although the name patriarch' was as yet unheard, the authority
   of the Bishop of Alexandria was almost absolute. The name archbishop'
   is here used for the first time. It is first applied apparently to
   Meletius (Apol. Ar. 71) in his list of clergy, but at a later date
   (about 358) to Athanasius in a contemporary inscription (see p. 564^a,
   note 1). At the beginning of his episcopate (supra, p. xxxvii.) we find
   him requested to ordain in a diocese of Upper Egypt by its bishop. He
   sends bishops on deputations (Fest. Ind. xxv., &c.), and exercises
   ordinary jurisdiction over bishops and people of Libya and Pentapolis
   (cf. reference to Synesius, supr., p. lxii.). This was a condition of
   things dating at least from the time of Dionysius (p. 178, note 2). In
   particular he had practically the appointment of bishops for all Egypt,
   so that in the course of his long episcopate all the Egyptian sees were
   manned by his faithful adherents (cf. p. 493). The mention of Dionysius
   suggests the question of the relation of the see of Alexandria to that
   of Rome, and of the latter to the Church generally. On the former
   point, what is necessary will be said in the Introd. to the de Sent.
   Dion. With regard to the wider question, Athanasius expresses reverence
   for that bishopric because it is an Apostolic throne,' and for Rome,
   because it is the metropolis of Romania' (p. 282). That is his only
   utterance on the subject. Such reverence ought, he says, to have
   secured Liberius from the treatment to which he had been subjected. The
   language cited excludes the idea of any divinely-given headship of the
   Church vested in the Roman bishop, for his object is to magnify the
   outrageous conduct of Constantius and the Arians. Still less can
   anything be elicited from the account given by Ath. of the case of the
   Dionysii, or of his own relations to successive Roman bishops. He
   speaks of them as his beloved brothers and fellow-ministers (e.g., p.
   489) and cordially. welcomes their sympathy and powerful support,
   without any thought of jurisdiction. But he furnishes us with
   materials, in the letter of Julius, for estimating not his own view of
   the Roman see, but that held by its occupant. The origin of the
   proceedings was the endeavour of the Easterns to procure recognition at
   Rome and in the West for their own nominee to the bishopric of
   Alexandria. They had requested Julius to hold a Council, and to be
   himself the judge if he so pleased' (Apol. c. Ar. 20). This was
   intended to frighten Athanasius, but not in the least, as the sequel
   shews, to submit the decisions of a Council to revision by a single
   bishop. Julius summoned a Council as described above (p. xliii.), and
   at the end of a long period of delay and controversy sent a letter
   expressing his view of the case to the Orientals. This document has
   been already discussed (p. xliv.). It forms an important landmark in
   the history of papal claims, standing at least as significantly in
   contrast with those of the successors of Julius, as with those of his
   predecessors.

   (g) Bishops and Councils. The superiority of councils to single bishops
   (including those of Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch) was questioned by no
   one in this age. Julius claims the support, not of authority inherent
   in his see, but of canons, and on the basis of them claims a voice in
   matters affecting the Church at large, not in his own name, but in that
   of us all, that so a just sentence might proceed from all' (Apol. c.
   Ar. 35). Again, just as the judgment of his predecessor Melchiades and
   his council was revised at Arles in 314 (Augustin. Ep. 105. 8), so the
   case of Athanasius and Marcellus was reheard at the Council of Sardica
   three years after the decision of Julius and his council. The council
   was the supreme organ of the Church for legislative, judicial, and
   doctrinal purposes; had any other of superior or even equal rank been
   recognised, or had the authority of councils themselves been defined a
   priori by a system of Church law, the confusion of the fourth century
   would not have arisen. Whether or no the age would have gained, we at
   least should have been the losers.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [93] Athanasius is not always innocent of the method of which he
   complains; e.g. when he uses Isa. i. 11, pleres eimi, as a proof of the
   Divine Perfection.

   [94] The idea of a mysterious unwritten tradition is a legacy of
   Gnosticism to the Church. IrenÃ¦us, in order to meet the Gnostic appeal
   to a supposed unwritten Apostolic tradition, confronts it with the
   consistency of the public and normal teaching of the Churches
   everywhere, of which the Roman Church is a convenient microcosm or
   compendium. The idea of a paradosis agraphos is adopted by Clement and
   Origen, and passes from the latter to Eusebius, and to the Cappadocian
   Fathers (Basil de Sp. S. 27, applies it only to practical details),
   Epiphanius, and later writers. Details in Harnack ii. 90, note, cf.
   Salmon, Infallibility, Lect. ix. On the somewhat different subject of
   the Disciplina Arcani,' see Herzog-Plitt. s.v. Arkan-Disciplia'

   [95] What is conspicuously true of the Second General Council is in
   reality not less true of the First. Its high authority to later ages is
   due not to its formal character as a council, but to the character of
   its work; the consent of the Church, and that not readily given, but as
   the result of a long process of searching and sifting, has given to it
   its irreformable' authority. Its authority is expressly put on a par
   with that of the Antiochene Synod of c. 269, by Ath. de Syn. 43
   (consult the whole discussion, pp. 473, 475, &c.). Short of a council
   which should include every bishop of the entire Church, in unanimous
   agreement,--an impossible contingency,--the claims of any given council
   to be truly ecumenical are relative, not absolute; and no consistent
   theory is possible of the conditions under which a council could by
   virtue of its constitution claim infallibility for its decisions. The
   supposed infallibility of general councils lies in reality outside
   them, in the authority which sanctions and consecrates their decisions.
   According to the precedent of NicÃ¦a this is the Church diffusive' (cf.
   p. 489, and Pusey, Councils, p. 225, sq.), and such consent, again,
   must necessarily be partial and relative. If a more tangible and
   expeditious theory is wanted, we have it in the Roman system, according
   to which a council is infallible if ratified by the Pope. This at once
   puts all such councils, whether local or general, on one level, and
   affords a ready criterion. In other words, the only consistent
   (mechanical) theory of the infallibility of councils is one which makes
   councils superfluous. If such a theory had been known to the Church in
   the age of councils, the councils would not have been held.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§5. Content of Revelation. God Three in One and the Incarnation.

   To dwell at length on the theology of Athanasius under this head is
   unnecessary here, not because there is little to say, but partly
   because what there is to say has been to some extent anticipated above,
   Â§Â§2, 3, and ch. ii. pp. xxxii., xxxvi., partly because the history of
   his life and work is the best exposition of what he believed and
   taught. That his theology on these central subjects was profoundly
   moulded by the Nicene formula is (to the present writer at least) the
   primary fact (see ch. ii. Â§3 (1), and (2) b). This of course
   presupposes that the Nicene faith found in him a character and mind
   prepared to become its interpreter and embodiment; and that this was so
   his pre-Nicene writings sufficiently shew.

   For instance, his progressive stress on the Unity of the Godhead in
   Father, Son, and Spirit is but the following up of the thought
   expressed de Incarn. 17. 1 en mono to heautou Patri holos on kata
   panta. It may be noted that he argues also from the idea of the Trinity
   to the coessential Godhead of the Spirit, ad Serap. i. 28, sq., Trias
   de estin ouch heos onomatos monon...alla alethei& 139; kai huparxei
   trias...eipatosan palin...trias estin e duas; and that he meets the
   difficulty (see infra, p. 438, ten lines from end, also Petav. Trin.
   VII. xiv.) of differentiating the relation of the Spirit to the Father
   from the gennesis of the Son by a confession of ignorance and a censure
   upon those who assume that they can search out the deep things of God
   (ib. 17-19). The principle might be applied to this point which is laid
   down de Decr. 11, that an act' belonging to the essence of God, cannot,
   by virtue of the simplicity of the Divine Nature, be more than one: the
   act' therefore of divine gennesis (the nature of which we do not know)
   cannot apply to the Spirit but only to the Son. But I do not recollect
   any passage in which Athanasius draws this conclusion from his own
   premises. The language of Athanasius on the procession of the Spirit is
   unstudied. In Exp. Fid. 4, he appears to adopt the procession' of the
   Spirit from the Father through the Son (after Dionysius, see Sent.
   Dion. 17). In Serap. i. 2, 20, 32, iii. 1, he speaks of the Spirit as
   idion tou Logou, just as the Word is idios tou Patros. His language on
   the subject, expressing the idea common to East and West (under the
   cloud of logomachies which envelop the subject) might possibly furnish
   the basis of an eirenicon' between the two separated portions of
   Christendom. In explaining the theophanies' of the Old Testament,
   Athanasius takes a position intermediate between that of the
   Apologists, &c. (supr., p. xxiii.) who referred them to the Word, and
   that of Augustine who referred them to Angels only. According to
   Athanasius the Angel' was and was not the Word: regarded as visible he
   was an Angel simply, but the Voice was the Divine utterance through the
   Word (see Orat. iii. 12, 14; de Syn. 27, Anath 15, note; also Serap. i.
   14).

   Lastly, it must again be insisted that in his polemic against Arianism
   Athanasius is centrally soteriological. It is unnecessary to collect
   passages in support of what will be fully appreciated only after a
   thorough study of the controversial treatises. The essence of his
   position is comprised in his paraphrase of St. Peter's address to the
   Jews, Orat. ii. 16, sq., or in the argument, ib. 67, sqq., i. 43, and
   iii. 13. With regard to the Incarnation, it may be admitted that
   Athanasius uses language which might have been modified had he had
   later controversies in view. His common use of anthropos for the
   Manhood of Christ (see below, p. 83) might be alleged by the Nestorian,
   his comparison of it to the vesture of the High Priest (Orat. i. 47,
   ii. 8, see note there) by the Apollinarian or Monophysite partisan. But
   at least his use of either class of expressions shews that he did not
   hold the doctrine associated in later times with the other. Moreover,
   while from first to last he is explicitly clear as to the seat of
   personality in Christ, which is uniformly assigned to the Divine Logos
   (p. 40, note 2 and reff.), the integrity of the manhood of Christ is no
   less distinctly asserted (cf. de Incarn. 18. 1, 21. 7). He uses soma
   and anthropos indifferently during the earlier stages of the conflict,
   ignoring or failing to notice the peculiarity of the Luciano-Arian
   Christology. But from 362 onward the full integrity of the Saviour's
   humanity, sarx and psuche logike or pneuma, is energetically asserted
   against the theory of Apollinarius and those akin to it [96] (cf.
   Letters 59 and 60, and c. Apoll.). Some corollaries of this doctrine
   must now be mentioned.

   The question of the sinlessness of Christ is not discussed by
   Athanasius ex professo until the controversy with Apollinarianism. In
   the earlier Arian controversy the question was in reality involved,
   partly by the Arian theory of the preptotes of the Word, partly by the
   correlated theory of prokope (cf. Orat. ii. 6, sqq.), and Athanasius
   instinctively falls back on the consideration that the Personality of
   the Son, if Divine, is necessarily sinless. In c. Apoll. i. 7, 17, ii.
   10 the question is more thoroughly analysed. The complete psychological
   identity of Christ's human nature with our own is maintained along with
   the absolute moral identity of His will (thelesis, the determination of
   will, not the thelema ousiodes or volitional faculty) with the Divine
   will.

   With regard to the human knowledge of Christ, the texts Mark xiii. 32,
   Luke ii. 52, lie at the foundation of his discussion Orat. iii. 42-53.
   The Arians appealed to these passages to support the contention that
   the Word, or Son of God in His Divine nature, was ignorant of the Day,'
   and advanced in knowledge. The whole argument of Athan. in reply is
   directed to shewing that these passages apply not to the Word or Son in
   Himself, but to the Son Incarnate. He knows as God, is ignorant as man.
   Omniscience is the attribute of Godhead, ignorance is proper to man.
   The Incarnation was not the sphere of advancement to the Word, but of
   humiliation and condescension; but the Manhood advanced in wisdom as it
   did in stature also, for advance belongs to man. That is the decisive
   and clear-cut position of Athanasius on this subject (which the notes
   there vainly seek to accommodate to the rash dogmatism of the schools).
   Athanasius appeals to the utterances of Christ which imply knowledge
   transcending human limitations in order to shew that such knowledge, or
   rather all knowledge, was possessed by the Word; in other words such
   utterances belong to the class of divine' not to that of human'
   phenomena in the life of Christ. So far as His human nature was
   concerned, He assumed its limitations of knowledge equally with all
   else that belongs to the physical and mental endowments of man. Why
   then was not Divine Omniscience exerted by Him at all times? This
   question is answered as all questions must be which arise out of any
   limitation of the Omnipotence of God in the Manhood of Christ. It was
   for our profit, as I at least think' (ib. 48). The very idea of the
   Incarnation is that of a limiting of the Divine under human conditions,
   the Divine being manifested in Christ only so far as the Wisdom of God
   has judged it necessary in order to carry out the purpose of His
   coming. In other words, Athanasius regarded the ignorance of Christ as
   economical' only in so far as the Incarnation is itself an oikonomia, a
   measured revelation, at once a veiling and a manifestation, of all that
   is in God. That the divine Omniscience wielded in the man Christ Jesus
   an adequate instrument for its own manifestation Athanasius firmly
   holds: the exact extent to which such manifestation was carried, the
   reserve of miraculous power or knowledge with which that Instrument was
   used, must be explained not by reference to the human mind, will, or
   character of Christ, but to the Divine Will and Wisdom which alone has
   both effected our redemption and knows the secrets of its bringing
   about. With Athanasius, we may quote St. Paul, tis egno noun Kuriou.

   It may be observed before leaving this point that Athanasius takes
   occasion (Â§43, fin., cf. 45) to distinguish two senses of the words the
   Son,' as referring on the one hand to the eternal, on the other to the
   human existence of Christ. To the latter he limits Mark xiii. 32: the
   point is of importance in view of his relation to Marcellus (supra, p.
   xxxvi.).

   As a further corollary of the Incarnation we may notice his frequent
   use (Orat. iii. 14, 29, 33, iv. 32, c. Apoll. i. 4, 12, 21) of the word
   theotokos as an epithet or as a name for the Virgin Mary. The
   translation Mother of God' is of course erroneous. God-bearer'
   (Gottes-bÃ¤rerin), the literal equivalent, is scarcely idiomatic
   English. The perpetual virginity of Mary is maintained incidentally (c.
   Apoll. i. 4), but there is an entire absence in his writings not only
   of worship of the Virgin, but of Mariology,' i.e., of the tendency to
   assign to her a personal agency, or any peculiar place, in the work of
   Redemption (Gen. iii. 15, Vulg.). Further, the argument of Orat. i. 51
   fin., that the sending of Christ in the flesh for the first time
   (loipon) liberated human nature from sin, and enabled the requirement
   of God's law to be fulfilled in man (an argument strictly within the
   lines of Rom. viii. 3), would be absolutely wrecked by the doctrine of
   the freedom of Mary from original sin (immaculate conception'). If that
   doctrine be held, sin was condemned in the flesh' (i.e., first deposed
   from its place in human nature, see Gifford or Meyer-Weiss in loc.),
   not by the sending of Christ, but by the congenital sinlessness of
   Mary. If the Arians had only known of the latter doctrine, they would
   have had an easy reply to that powerful passage.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [96] The doctrine of Athanasius is, not formally but none the less
   really, the doctrine of Chalcedon, which again stands or falls together
   with that of NicÃ¦a. Like the latter, it transcends the power of human
   thought to do more than state it in terms which exclude the (Nestorian
   and Monophysite) alternatives. The Man Jesus Christ is held to have
   lacked nothing that constitutes personality in man; the human
   personality which therefore belongs to it ideally, being in fact merged
   in the Divine personality of the Son. The impersonality,' as it is
   sometimes called, of Christ quÃ¢ man is therefore better spoken of as
   His Divine Personality. Personality and will are correlated but not
   identical ideas.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§6. Derivative Doctrines. Grace and the Means of Grace; The Christian
   Life; The Last Things.

   The idea of Grace is important to the theological system of Athanasius,
   in view of the central place occupied in that system by the idea of
   restoration and new creation as the specific work of Christ upon His
   fellow-men (supra, Â§2, cf. Orat. ii. 56, Exp. in Pss. xxxiii. 2,
   cxviii. 5, LXX.). But, in common with the Greek Fathers generally, he
   does not analyse its operation, nor endeavour to fix its relation to
   free will (cf. Orat. i. 37 fin., iii. 25 sub fin.). The divine
   predestination relates (for anything that Ath. says) not to individuals
   so much as to the Purpose of God, before all ages, to repair the
   foreseen evil of man's fall by the Incarnation (Orat. ii. 75, sq.). On
   the general subject of Sacraments and their efficacy, he says little or
   nothing. The initiatory rite of Baptism makes us sons of God (de Decr.
   31, cf. Orat. i. 37 ut supra), and is the only complete renewal to be
   looked for in this life, Serap. iv. 13). It is accompanied (de Trin. et
   Sp. S. 7) by confession of faith in the Trinity, and the baptism
   administered by Arians who do not really hold this faith is therefore
   in peril of losing its value (Orat. ii. 42, fin.). The grace of the
   Spirit conferred at baptism will be finally withdrawn from the wicked
   at the last judgment (Exp. in Ps. lxxv. 13, LXX.). In the de Trin. et
   Sp. S. 21 baptism is coupled with the imposition of hands as one rite.
   On the Eucharist there is an important passage (ad Serap. iv. 19),
   which must be given in full. He has been speaking of sin against the
   Holy Spirit, which latter name he applies [see above, ch. iii. Â§1 (22)]
   to the Saviour's Divine Personality. He proceeds to illustrate this by
   John vi. 62-64.

   For here also He has used both terms of Himself, flesh and spirit; and
   He distinguished the spirit from what is of the flesh in order that
   they might believe not only in what was visible in Him, but in what was
   invisible, and so understand that what He says is not fleshly, but
   spiritual. For for how many would the body suffice as food, for it to
   become meat even for the whole world? But this is why He mentioned the
   ascending of the Son of Man into heaven; namely, to draw them off from
   their corporeal idea, and that from thenceforth they might understand
   that the aforesaid flesh was heavenly from above, and spiritual meat,
   to be given at His hands. For what I have said unto you,' says He, is
   spirit and life;' as much as to say, what is manifested, and to be
   given for the salvation of the world, is the flesh which I wear. But
   this, and the blood from it, shall be given to you spiritually at My
   hands as meat, so as to be imparted spiritually in each one, and to
   become for all a preservative to resurrection of life eternal.'

   Beyond this he does not define the relation of the outward and visible
   in the Eucharist to the spiritual and inward. The reality of the
   Eucharistic gift is insisted on as strongly as its spirituality in such
   passages as ad Max. (Letter 61) 2 sub fin., and the comment on Matt.
   vii. 6 (Migne xxvii. 1380), See to it, therefore, Deacon, that thou do
   not administer to the unworthy the purple of the sinless body,' and the
   protest of the Egyptian bishops (Apol. c. Ar. 5) that their churches
   are adorned only by the blood of Christ and by the pious worship of
   Him.' The Holy Table is expressly stated to have been made of wood
   (Hist. Ar. 56), and was situated (Apol. Fug.) in a space called the
   hierateion. The Eucharist was celebrated in most places every Sunday,
   but not on week-days (Apol. c. Ar. 11). But in Alexandria we hear of it
   being celebrated on a Friday on one occasion, and this was apparently a
   normal one (Apol. Fug. 24, Apol. Const. 25). To celebrate the Eucharist
   was the office of the bishop or presbyter (Apol. c. Ar. 11). Ischyras
   (supr. p. xxxviii.) was held by Athanasius to be a layman only, and
   therefore incapable of offering the Eucharist. The sacrificial aspect
   of the Eucharist is not touched upon, except in the somewhat strange
   fragment (Migne xxvi. 1259) from an Oratio de defunctis, which contains
   the words he de ge anaimaktos thusia exilasmos. He insists on the
   finality of the sacrifice of the Cross, Orat. ii. 9, hai men gar kata
   nomon...ouk eichon to piston, kath' hemeran parerchomenai; & 211; de
   tou Soteros thusia hapax genomene teteleioke to pan. On repentance and
   the confession of sins there is little to quote. He strongly asserts
   the efficacy of repentance, and explains Heb. vi. 4, of the unique
   cleansing and restoring power of baptism (Serap. iv. 13, as cited
   above.) A catena on Jeremiah preserves a fragment [supra, ch. iii. Â§1
   (38)], which compares the ministry of the priest in baptism to that in
   confession: houtos kai ho exomologoumenos en metanoia dia tou hi&
   153;reos lambanei ten aphesin chariti Christou. Of compulsory
   confession, or even of this ordinance as an ordinary element of the
   Christian life, we read nothing.

   On the Christian ministry again there is little direct teaching. The
   ordinations by the presbyter Colluthus (Apol. Ar. 11, 12) are treated
   as null. The letter (49) to Dracontius contains vigorous and beautiful
   passages on the responsibility of the Ministry. On the principles of
   Christian conduct there is much to be gathered from obiter dicta in the
   writings of Athanasius. His description (cf. supra, p. xlviii.) of the
   revival of religious life at Alexandria in 346, and the exhortations in
   the Easter letters, are the most conspicuous passages for this purpose.
   In particular, he insists (e.g., p. 67) on the necessity of a holy life
   and pure mind for the apprehension of divine things, and especially for
   the study of the Scriptures. He strongly recommends the discipline of
   fasting, in which, as compared with other churches (Rome especially),
   the Alexandrian Christians were lax (Letter 12), but he warns them in
   his first Easter letter to fast not only with the body, but also with
   the soul.' He also dwells (Letter 6) on the essential difference of
   spirit between Christian festivals and Jewish observance of days.
   Christ is the true Festival, embracing the whole of the Christian life
   (Letters 5, 14). He lays stress on love to our neighbour, and
   especially on kindness to the poor (Letter i. 11, Hist. Ar. 61, Vit.
   Ant. 17, 30). On one important practical point he is very emphatic:
   Persecution is a device of the devil' (Hist. Ar. 33). This summary
   judgment was unfortunately less in accordance with the spirit of the
   times than with the Spirit of Christ.

   The ascetic teaching of Athanasius must be reserved for the
   introduction to the Vita Antoni (cf. Letters 48, 49, also above, p.
   xlviii.). His eschatology calls for discussion in connection with the
   language of the de Incarnatione, and will be briefly noticed in the
   introduction to that tract. With regard to prayers for the departed, he
   distinguishes (on Luke xiii. 21, &c., Migne xxvii. 1404) the careless,
   whose friends God will move to assist them with their prayers, from the
   utterly wicked who are beyond the help of prayer.

   Chronology and Tables

   Â§1. Sources.

   (1) The Festal Letters of Athanasius with their Index and the Historia
   Acephala constitute our primary source for chronological details (see
   below, Â§2). (2) Along with these come the chronological notices
   scattered up and down the other writings of Athanasius. These are of
   course of the utmost importance, but too often lack definiteness. (3)
   The chronological data in the fifth-century historians, headed by
   Socrates, are a mass of confusion, and have been a source of confusion
   ever since, until the discovery of the primary sources, No. (1)
   mentioned above. They must, therefore, be used only in strict
   subordination to the latter. (4) More valuable but less abundant
   secondary notices are to be derived from the Life of Pachomius, from
   the letter of Ammon (infra, p. 487), and from other writers of the day.
   (5) For the movements of the Emperors the laws in the Codex
   Theodosianus (ed. HÃ¤nel in Corpus Juris Ante-Justiniani) give many
   dates, but the text is not in a satisfactory condition.

   (6) Modern discussions. The conflicting attempts at an Athanasian
   chronology prior to the discovery of the Festal Letters are tabulated
   in the Appendix to Newman's Arians, and discussed by him in his
   introduction to the Historical Tracts (Oxf. Lib. Fathers). The notes to
   Dr. Bright's article Athanasius in D.C.B., and his introduction to the
   Hist. Writings of S. Ath., may be profitably consulted, as also may
   Larsow's Fest-briefe (Leipz., 1852), with useful calendar information
   by Dr. J. G. Galle, the veteran professor of Astronomy at Breslau, and
   Sievers on the Hist. Aceph. (Supr. ch. i. Â§3.)

   But by far the most valuable chronological discussions are those of
   Prof. Gwatkin in his Studies of Arianism. He has been the first to make
   full use of the best data, and moreover gives very useful lists of the
   great officials of the Empire and of the movements of the Eastern
   Emperors. Mr. Gwatkin's results were criticised in the Church Quarterly
   Review, vol. xvi. pp. 392-398, 1883, by an evidently highly-qualified
   hand [97] . The criticisms of the Reviewer have been most carefully
   weighed by the present writer, although they quite fail to shake him in
   his general agreement with Mr. Gwatkin's results.

   For the general chronology of the period we may mention Weingarten's
   Zeit-tafeln (ed. 3, 1888) as useful, though not especially so for our
   purpose, and above all Clinton's Fasti Romani, which, however, were
   drawn up in the dark ages before the discovery of the Festal Letters,
   and are therefore antiquated so far as the life of Athanasius is
   concerned.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [97] The candid, but friendly, and often just, criticisms on Mr.
   Gwatkin's book do not concern us here. But the Reviewer's chronological
   strictures are his weakest point: he uses his texts without criticism,
   and falls far short of Mr. Gwatkin's standard of searching historical
   method.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§2. Principles and Method.

   The determination of the leading Athanasian dates depends mainly on the
   value to be assigned to the primary sources, Â§1 (1). Reserving the
   fuller discussion of these texts for the Introduction to the Letters
   (pp. 495 sq., 500 sq.), it will suffice to state here what seem to be
   the results of an investigation of their value. (1) The Historia
   Acephala and Festal Index are independent of each other (cf. Sievers,
   p. 95, misunderstood, I think, by Mr. Gwatkin, p. 221). (2) They both
   belong to the generation after the death of Athanasius, the H. A. being
   apparently the earlier. (3) The data as to which they agree must,
   therefore, come from a source prior to either, i.e., contemporary with
   Athanasius. (4) In several important particulars they are confirmed by
   our secondary Egyptian sources, such as the Letter of Ammon and Life of
   Pachomius. (5) They verify most of the best results arrived at
   independently of them (of this below), and (6) In no case do they agree
   in fixing a date which can be proved to be wrong, or which there are
   sound reasons for distrusting. On these grounds I have classed the
   Historia and Index as primary sources, and maintain that the dates as
   to which the two documents agree must be accepted as certain. This
   principle at once brings the doubtful points in the chronology within
   very moderate limits. The general chronological table, in which the
   dates fixed by the agreement of these sources are printed in black
   type, will make this plain enough. It remains to shew that the
   principle adopted works out well in detail, or in other words, that the
   old Alexandrian chronology, transmitted to us through the twofold
   channel of the Historia and the Index, harmonises the apparent
   discrepancies, and solves the difficulties, of the chronological
   statements of Athanasius, and tallies with the most trustworthy
   information derived from other sources. In some cases it has been found
   desirable to discuss points of chronology where they occur in the Life
   of Athanasius; what will be attempted here is to complete what is there
   passed over without thorough discussion, in justification of the scheme
   adopted in our general chronological table.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§3. Applications.

   (a) Death of Alexander and Election of Athanasius. That the latter took
   place on June 8, 328, is established by the agreement of our sources,
   together with the numbering of the Festal Letters. Theodoret (H. E. i.
   26) and others, misled by some words of Athanasius (Apol. c. Ar. 59),
   handed down to later ages the statement that Alexander died five months
   after the Council of NicÃ¦a. It had long been seen that this must be a
   mistake (Tillemont, vi. 736, Montfaucon, Monit. in Vit. S. Athan.) and
   various suggestions [98] were made as to the terminus a quo for the
   five months' mentioned by Athanasius; that of Montfaucon remains the
   most probable (see ch. ii. Â§3 (1), p. xxi.). But the field was left
   absolutely clear for the precise and concordant statement of our
   chroniclers, which, therefore, takes undisputed possession. (Further
   details, supr. p. xx. sq.; Introd. to Letters, pp. 495, 303).

   (b) The first exile of Athanasius. The duration is fixed by the Hist.
   Aceph. (see Introd. p. 495, sq.) as two years, four months, and eleven
   days, and this exactly coincides with the dates given by the Index for
   his departure for Tyre, July 11, 335, and his return from exile Nov.
   23, 337 (not 338; for the Diocletian year began at the end of August).
   Although, therefore, the Hist. Aceph. is not available for the date,
   the constructive agreement between it and the Index is complete. But it
   has been contended that the year of the return from this exile must
   still be placed in 338, in spite of the new evidence to the contrary.
   The reasons alleged are very weak. (1) The letter of Constantine II.,
   dated Treveri, June 17, so far from making against the year 337,
   clinches the argument in its favour. Constantine is still only CÃ¦sar'
   when he writes it (pp. 146, 272); he was proclaimed Augustus on Sep. 9,
   337 (Montf. in ann. 338 tries in vain to parry this decisive objection
   to the later date. He appeals to Maximin in Eus. H. E. ix. 10, but
   overlooks the word sebastos there. Is it conceivable that a
   disappointed eldest son, as sensitive about his claims as Constantine
   was, would within so short a time of becoming Augustus' be content to
   call himself merely CÃ¦sar'?) The objection as to the distance of
   Treveri from Nicomedia has no weight, as we show elsewhere (p. xli.,
   note 4); Constantine might have heard of his father's death a fortnight
   before the date of this letter. (2) The law (Cod. Th. X. x. 4) dated
   Viminacium, June 12, 338, if correctly ascribed to Constantius, would
   certainly lend plausibility to the view that it was at that time that
   Athanasius met Constantius at Viminacium (p. 240). But the names are so
   often confused in mss., and the text of the Theodosian Code requires
   such frequent correction, that there is no solid objection to set
   against the extremely cogent proofs (Gwatkin, p. 138) that the law
   belongs to Constantine, who in that case cannot have been at Trier on
   June 17, 338. As to Constantius, there is no reason against his having
   been in Pannonia at some time in the summer of 337. (3) The statement
   of Theodoret (H. E. ii. 1) that Ath. stayed at Treveri two years and
   four months' seems to reproduce that of the Hist. Aceph. as to the
   length of the exile, and is only verbally inexact in applying it to the
   period actually spent in Trier. (4) The language of Letter 10, the
   Festal letter for 338, is not absolutely decisive, but Â§Â§3, 11
   certainly imply that when it was written, whether at Alexandria or
   elsewhere, the durance of Athanasius was at an end. There can, we
   submit, be no reasonable doubt that the first exile of Athanasius began
   with his departure from Alexandria on July 11, 335, and ended with his
   return thither on Nov. 23, 337.

   (c) Commencement of the second exile. Here again the agreement of our
   chronicles is constructive only, owing to the loss of the earlier part
   of the Hist. Aceph.; but it is none the less certain. The exile ended,
   as everyone now admits and as both chronicles tell us, on Paoph. 24
   (Oct. 21), 346: it lasted, according to the H. A., seven years, six
   months, and three days. This carries us back to Phar. 21 (April 16),
   339. Now we learn from the Index that he left the Church of Theonas on
   the night of Mar. 18-19, and from the Encyclical, 4, 5, that he took
   refuge first in another church, then in some secret place till over
   Easter Sunday (Apr. 15). This fits exactly with Apr. 16 as the date of
   his flight to Rome. To this there is only one serious objection, viz.,
   that Ath. was summoned (p. 239) to Milan by Constantius after the end
   of three years from his leaving Alexandria. It has been assumed
   (without any proof) that this took place just before' the council of
   Sardica. As a matter of fact, Constans left Athan. in Milan, and
   (apparently after his summer campaign) ordered him to follow him to
   Trier, in order to travel thence to the Council. Athanasius does not
   state either how long he remained at Milan, or when he was ordered to
   Trier; for a chronological inference, in opposition to explicit
   evidence, he furnishes no basis whatever. I agree with Mr. Gwatkin
   (whom his Reviewer quite misunderstands) in placing the Milan interview
   about May, 342, and the journey from Trier to Sardica after Easter
   (probably later still) in 343 (Constans was in Britain in the spring of
   343, and had returned to Trier before June 30, Cod. Th. XII. i. 36, see
   also supr. p. xlv.). A more reasonable objection to the statement of
   the Index is that of Dr. Bright (p. xv. note 5), who sets against its
   information that Athan. fled from Theonas' four days before Gregory's
   arrival, the statement of the Encyclical that he left a certain church
   after Gregory's outrages at Eastertide. But clearly Athan. first
   escaped from the church of Theonas, afterwards (between Good Friday and
   Easter) from some other church (alle ekklesia), not named by him
   (Quirinus,' cf. p. 95, note 1), and finally from the City itself. (Dr.
   Bright's arguments in favour of 340 are vitiated in part by his placing
   Easter on April 9, i.e. on a Wednesday, instead of the proper day,
   Sunday, Mar. 30). The date, April 16, 339, is, therefore, well
   established as the beginning of the second exile, and there is no
   tangible evidence against it. It is, moreover, supported by the
   subscription to the letter to Serapion, which stands in the stead of
   the Easter letter for 340, and which states that the letter was written
   from Rome.

   (d) Council of Sardica and death of Gregory. The confusion into which
   the whole chronology of the surrounding events was thrown by the
   supposition (which was naturally taken without question upon the
   authority of Socrates and Sozomen) that the Sardican council met in
   347, is reflected in the careful digest of opinions made by Newman
   (Arians, Appendix, or better, Introduction to Hist. Treatises of S.
   Ath. p. xxvi.; cf. also Hefele, Eng. Tra., vol. 2, p. 188, sq., notes),
   and especially in the difficulties caused by the necessity of placing
   the Council of Milan in 345 before Sardica, and the mission of
   Euphrates of Cologne to Antioch as late as 348. Now the Hist. Aceph.,
   by giving October, 346, as the date of the return of Athanasius from
   his second exile, at once challenged the received date for Sardica, and
   J. D. Mansi, the learned editor of the Collectio Amplissima' of the
   Councils, used this fact as the key to unlock the chronological tangle
   of the period. He argued that the Council of Sardica must be put back
   at least as early as 344; but the natural conservatism of learning
   resisted his conclusions until the year 1852, when the Festal Letters,
   discovered ten years earlier, were made available for the theological
   public of Europe. The date 347 was then finally condemned. Not only did
   Letter 18, written at Easter, 345, refer to the Council's decision
   about Easter, and Letter 19 refer to his restoration as an accomplished
   fact; the Index most positively dated the synod in the year 343, which
   year has now taken its place as the accepted date, although the month
   and duration of the assembly are still open to doubt (Supr. p. xlv.,
   note 6). In any case it is certain that the Easter at which the
   deputies from Constans and the Council reached Antioch was Easter, 344.
   This brings us to the question of the date of Gregory's death. Mr.
   Gwatkin rightly connects the Council which deposed Stephen for his
   behaviour to the Western deputies, and elected Leontius, with the issue
   of the Macrostich' creed three years' (de Syn. 26) after the Council of
   the Dedication, i.e., in the summer of 344. This is our only notice of
   time for the Council in question, and it is not very precise; but the
   Council may fairly be placed in the early summer, which would allow
   time for the necessary preliminaries after Easter, and for the meeting
   of the fathers at reasonable notice. (Perhaps Stephen was promptly and
   informally deposed (Thdt.) after Easter, but a regular council would be
   required to ratify this act and to elect his successor.) After the
   Council (we are again not told how long after) Constantius writes a
   public letter to Alexandria forbidding further persecution of the
   orthodox (277, note 3). This may well have been in the later summer of
   344. Then about ten months later' (ib.) Gregory dies. This would bring
   us about' to the early summer of 345; and this rough calculation [99]
   is curiously confirmed by the precise statement of the Index xviii.,
   that Gregory died on June 26 (345, although the Index, in accordance
   with its principle of arrangement, which will be explained in the
   proper place, puts the notice under the following year). Of course the
   date of the letter of Constantius, which Athanasius gives as the
   terminus a quo of the ten months,' cannot be fixed except by
   conjecture, and the date given by the Index is (1) the only precise
   statement we have, (2) is likely enough in itself, and (3) agrees
   perfectly with the datum of de Synod 26. That is to say, as far as our
   evidence goes it appears to be correct.

   (e) Return of Athanasius in 346. Here the precise statements of the
   Index and Hist. Aceph. agree, and are confirmed by Letter 19, which was
   written after his return. The date therefore requires no discussion.
   But it is important as a signal example of the high value to be
   assigned to the united witness of our two chronicles. For this is the
   pivot date which, in the face of all previously accepted calculations,
   has taken its place as unassailably correct, and has been the centre
   from which the recovery of the true chronology of the period has
   proceeded. The difficulty in dating the interview with Constantius at
   Antioch is briefly discussed p. xlvii. note 10.

   (f) Irruption of Syrianus and Intrusion of George. The former event is
   dated without any room for doubt on the night of Thursday, Feb. 8
   (Mechir 13), 356 (see p. 301, also Index and Hist. Aceph.). Here again
   the accuracy of our chronicles on points where they agree comes out
   strongly. It should be noted that an ill-informed writer could hardly
   have avoided a blunder here; for 356 was a leap-year: and in
   consequence of this (1) all the months from Thoth to Phamenoth,
   inclusive, began a day later, owing to the additional Epagomenon before
   the first day of Thoth: the 13th Mechir would, therefore, in these
   years correspond to Feb. 8, not as usual to Feb. 7. (2) Owing to the
   Roman calendar inserting its intercalary day at the end of February,
   Feb. 8 would fall on the Thursday, not on the Friday (reckoning back
   from Easter on Apr. 7: see Tables C, D., pp. 501 sq.). This date, then,
   may rank as one of the absolutely fixed points of our chronology. After
   the above examples of the value of the concordant testimony of the two
   chronicles, we must demand positive and circumstantial proof to the
   contrary before rejecting their united testimony that George made his
   entry into Alexandria in the Lent of 357, not 356. As a matter of fact
   all the positive evidence (supr., p. lii., note 11) is the other way,
   and when weighed against it, the feather-weight of an inference from a
   priori probability, and from the assumed silence of Athanasius (Ap.
   Fug. 6), kicks the beam.

   (g) Athanasius in 362. The difficulty here is that Athanasius clearly
   returned after the murder of George, which, according to Amm. Marc.
   XXII. xi., took place upon the receipt at Alexandria of the news of the
   execution of Artemius at Antioch, which latter event must be placed in
   July. Therefore Athanasius would not have returned till August, 362. On
   the other hand the Hist. Aceph. makes George arrested four days after
   his return to Alexandria, and immediately upon the proclamation of the
   new Emperor, Nov. 30, 361. On Dec. 24 George is murdered, on Feb. 9 the
   edict for the return of the exiles is promulged, and on Feb. 21
   Athanasius returns, to take flight again eight months' later, on Oct.
   24. The difficulty is so admirably sifted by Mr. Gwatkin (pp. 220, 221)
   that I refer to his discussion instead of giving one here. His
   conclusion is clearly right, viz., that Ammianus here, as occasionally
   elsewhere, has missed the right order of events, and that George was
   really murdered at the time stated in Hist. Aceph. The only addition to
   be made to Mr. Gwatkin's decisive argument is that Ammianus is
   inconsistent with himself, and in agreement with the Hist. Aceph., in
   dating the arrest of George shortly after his return from court. As
   George would not have been at Julian's court, this notice implies that
   the arrest took place only shortly after the death of Constantius.
   Moreover, George, who even under Constantius was not over-ready to
   visit his see, and who knew well enough the state of heathen feeling
   against him, would not be likely to return to Alexandria after Julian
   had been six months on the throne. We have then not so much to balance
   Ammianus against the Hist. Aceph., as to balance one of his statements,
   not otherwise confirmed, against another which is supported by the
   Hist. Aceph., and by other authorities as well, especially Epiph. HÃ¦r.
   76. 1. (The Festal Index gives no precise date here, except Oct. 24,
   for the flight of Athanasius, which so far as it goes confirms the
   Hist. Aceph.) Moreover, "on the side of Ammianus there is at worst an
   oversight; whereas the Hist. Aceph. would need to be re-written." The
   murder of George, Dec. 24, 361, return of Athanasius, Feb. and his
   flight, Oct. 24, 362, may therefore be taken as firmly-established
   dates.

   (h) Supposed Council at Alexandria in 363. This Synod assumed by
   Baronius, Montfaucon (Vit. in Ann. 363. 3) and others, after Theodoret
   (H. E. iv. 2) must be pronounced fictitious (so already Vales. in Thdt.
   l.c.). (1) The letter of Ammon (extract printed in this volume, p. 487)
   tells us on the authority of Athanasius that when Pammon and Theodore
   miraculously announced the death of Julian, they informed Athan. that
   the new Emperor was to be a Christian, but that his reign would be
   short; that Athanasius must go at once and secretly to the Emperor,
   whom he would meet on his journey before the army reached Antioch, that
   he would be favourably received by him, and that he would obtain an
   order for his restoration. Now (apart from the possibility of a grain
   of truth in the pheme of the death of Julian) all these details bear
   the unmistakeable character of a vaticinium post eventum, in other
   words, we have the story as it was current when Ammon drew up the
   document in question at the request of Archbishop Theophilus (see also
   p. 567, note 1). At that time, then, the received account was that
   Athan. hastened secretly to meet Jovian as soon as he knew of his
   accession, and that he met him between Antioch and Nisibis. Now this
   native Egyptian account is transmitted independently by two other
   channels. (2) The Hist. Aceph. viii. tells us that the bishop entered
   Alexandria secretly adventu eius non pluribus cognito,' went by ship to
   Jovian, and returned with letters from him. (3) The Festal Index tells
   us that eight months (i.e., Oct. 24-June 26) after the flight of Ath.
   Julian died. On his death being published, Athan. returned secretly by
   night to Alexandria. Then on Sept. 6 he crossed the Euphrates (this
   seems to be the meaning of embarked at the Eastern Hierapolis,' the
   celebrated city, perhaps the ancient Karkhemish, which commanded the
   passage of the river, though some miles from its W. bank) and met the
   Emperor Jovian, by whom he was eventually dismissed with honour,
   returning to Alexandria Feb. 20, 364. Jovian was at Edessa Sept. 27, at
   Antioch Oct. 23.

   The agreement of the three documents is most striking, and the more so
   since the chronicles are clearly independent both of one another and
   especially of the letter of Ammon, as is clear from the fact that
   neither mentions the pheme, while the Festal Index implicitly
   contradicts it. This appears to be a crucial case in many ways.
   Firstly, the three narratives are all consistent in excluding the
   possibility of any such council as is supposed to have been summoned
   (see above, p. lx.). Against this there is nothing but the hasty
   inference of Thdt. (corrected by Valois, see above, ib.); the valueless
   testimony of the Libellus Synodicus (9th cent.); the marvellous tale of
   Sozom. v. 7 (referred to this time by Tillem. viii. 219, but by Soz. to
   the death of George: probably an amplification of Hist. Aceph. visus
   est') that Athanasius suddenly to the delight of his people was found
   enthroned in his Church; and the more vague statement of Socr. (iii.
   24) that he regained his church at once after Julian's death.' As the
   three fifth-century writers are implicitly contradicted by three
   writers of Alexandria at the end of the previous century, the latter
   must be believed against the former. Secondly, the Index, the later as
   it appears, of the two chronicles, would seem to represent a form of
   the story less marvellous and therefore earlier than that of the
   Narratio. Now the latter certainly belongs to the Episcopate of
   Theophilus. The Index therefore can scarcely be placed later, and the
   Hist. Aceph. would fall, as Sievers, Einl. 2, had independently placed
   it at the beginning of the Episcopate of Theophilus. Thirdly, we have
   here an excellent example not only of the value of the combined
   evidence of the two chronicles, but also of their character as
   representing in many important respects the Alexandrian tradition of
   the last third of the fourth century. Before leaving this question it
   will be well to consider the dates a little more closely. Hierapolis
   was counted eight days' journey from Antioch. From Alexandria to
   Antioch by sea was about 500 miles, i.e. with a fair wind scarcely more
   than four days' sail (it might be less, cf. Conybeare and Howson, St.
   Paul, vol. 2, p. 376, sq. ed. 1877). This allows about twelve days for
   Athan. to reach the Euphrates from Alexandria, remembering that
   southerly winds prevail in the Eastern Mediterranean at this season
   (Sievers, Einl. 28). Now Athan. reached Hierapolis on Sept. 6 (Thoth 8,
   Egyptian leap-year). But according to the Index, he reached Alex. after
   Julian's death was published, and this according to Hist. Aceph. was on
   Mesori 26, i.e. Aug. 19. From that day to Sept. 6 are eighteen days,
   leaving about a week's margin for Ath. to hear the news, reach
   Alexandria, and perhaps for delay in finding a vessel, &c. But a far
   wider margin is really available, for the official announcement must
   have been preceded by many rumours, and was probably not despatched
   till more than a fortnight after Julian's death (as is observed by Mr.
   Gwatkin, p. 221). If we remember that Athanasius, according to the
   Letter of Ammon, was making all possible haste (supra, Â§9) we shall
   again realise the subtle cohesion of these three sources, and the
   impossibility of the large Synod' imagined by some historians for the
   year 363.

   (k) Exile under Valens. The date of this is discussed by Tillem. (note
   96) and Montf. Vit. who, on the unstable basis of a computation of
   Theophanes (about 800 a.d.) and of the vague and loose sequences of
   events in Socr. and Sozom., tentatively refer the exile to the year
   367. The only show of solid support for this date was that Tatianus (of
   later and unfortunate celebrity), whom the Photian Life and that by the
   Metaphrast connected with the expulsion, was known from Cod. Theod. to
   have been Prefect of Egypt in 367. But this airy fabric now gives place
   to the precise and accurate data of the Theophilan chronicles. Both
   Index and Hist. Aceph. place the occurrence not under Tatian but under
   Flavian, governor of Egypt 364-366. Both fix the year 365. The Hist.
   Aceph. (used by Soz. vi. 12, who however makes no use of the dates)
   gives May 5, 365, for the Imperial order against bishops restored by
   Julian, June 8 for the reference to the Emperor (supra, ch. ii. Â§9),
   Oct. 5 for the retreat of Athan. and search for him by Flavian and Duke
   Victorinus, Feb. 1 for the return of Athanasius. This detailed
   chronology is corroborated in two ways; first by a letter of Libanius
   (Ep. 569) to Flavian, thanking him for a present of [Egyptian] doves,
   and congratulating him on his victory' (a play on the name Victorinus
   is added), but with a satirical hint that if only Victorinus had any
   prisoners to shew for his pains (a clear allusion to the escape of
   Ath.) he (Libanius) would think him a finer fellow even than Cleon
   (Siev. Einl. 31). Secondly, the restoration of Ath. by Valens becomes
   historically intelligible, in view of the danger from Procopius, as
   pointed out supr. p. lxi., fin. We cannot then doubt that the
   chronicles are here once more the channels of the genuine chronological
   tradition.

   (1) Death of Athanasius. It is superfluous to discuss this date at the
   present day, but it may be worth while to point out for the last time
   how admirably the combined testimony of our chronicles confirms the
   judgment of the best critics (Montfaucon, Tillemont, &c.) antecedent to
   their discovery, and how clearly the secondary value to be assigned to
   the chronological statements of Socrates and Sozomen once more comes
   out (Socr. iv. 21 puts the date at 371, and was followed by Papebroke,
   Petavius and others (fuller details and discussion of the question on
   its ancient footing in Newman's preface to Hist. Tracts of St. Athan.,
   pp. xx., sqq.). But no one any longer questions the date of May 2-3,
   373. The fact that the Hist. Aceph. gives May 3 and the Index May 2
   (the date observed in the later calendars) vouches for the independence
   of the two documents and for the very early date of the former:
   probably, as Sievers and others suggest, the true date is the night
   between May 2 and May 3.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [98] E.g. that he died five months after his return home from the
   council (Tillem.), or after the reconciliation of Meletius (Montf.). As
   neither event is dated, both hypotheses render the five months' useless
   for chronology.

   [99] The above resumÃ© of the details of the evidence makes it clear
   that Mr. Gwatkin's alleged oversights are in reality those of his
   critic. The proposal of the latter to correct Epiph.' in Fest. Ind. to
   Pharmuthi' is especially gratuitous.

   Appendix.

   ------------------------

   The Civil and Military Government of Egypt in the Lifetime of
   Athanasius.

   The name Egypt in the fourth century was applied firstly to the
   diocese' or group of provinces governed by the PrÃ¦fectus Ã†gypti or
   PrÃ¦fectus Augustalis,' secondly to the Delta or Ã†gyptus Propria, one of
   the provinces of which the diocese was made up. These provinces
   (Ammian. Marc. XXII. xvi.) were originally three in number: Egypt
   proper, Libya, and the Thebais. During our period they became five,
   firstly by the separation of the Eastern Delta from Egypt proper under
   the name of Augustamnica in 341 (infr. pp. 130, 504, note 17a);
   secondly by the subdivision of Libya (at an uncertain date) into Hither
   Libya (Libya Inferior,' or Siccior'), and the Pentapolis or Libya
   Superior of which Ptolemais was the capital. At a later date still the
   Heptanomis was separated from Ã†gyptus' under the name of Arcadia, given
   in honour of the Emperor Arcadius. These then are the six provinces
   which make up Egypt' in the Notilia (shortly after a.d. 400). Each
   province, with the exception of Augustamnica, whose governor enjoyed
   the title of corrector,' was under a prÃ¦ses (hegoumenos): not one of
   the six was of consular rank. This regulation was due to the peculiar
   constitution of the diocese or province of Egypt in the wider sense. At
   the head of this latter, and subordinate in rank, though scarcely
   second in dignity, to the Comes Orientis, was the Prefect of Egypt, who
   enjoyed an exceptional position among the greater provincial officers.
   He appears to have been, at least in practice, directly under the
   PrÃ¦fectus PrÃ¦torio per Orientem, the supreme civil representative of
   Augustus' throughout the Eastern Empire. The title PrÃ¦fectus had in
   fact a different history as applied to the Prefect of the East and the
   Prefect of Egypt respectively. As applied to the latter, it was as old
   as Augustus. The importance of Egypt, mainly but not solely as a
   granary of Rome, had led the politic heir of Julius CÃ¦sar to ensure its
   complete and peculiar dependence on the emperor. For this object, its
   government was committed to a nominee of the emperor, who must be not a
   Senator but an Eques only; i.e. he must never have held one of the
   great offices of state from Consul to quÃ¦stor. No one of senatorial
   rank was to be permitted to set foot in Egypt. (For the prerogatives of
   the prÃ¦fectus Ã†gypti under Augustus see Tacitus Ann. xii. 60. also Ulp.
   Digest. I. xvii.). This arrangement survived the various vicissitudes
   of Egypt in the third century, and even the reorganisation of the
   Empire by Diocletian. Egypt was severed off between 365 and 386 from
   the Eastern Diocese' (Sievers, p. 117, appealing to Mommsen in Abhandl.
   der Berliner Akad. 1862). Upon the above facts was founded the (perhaps
   merely popular) title Augustalis' which we find already applied to the
   Prefect of Egypt about a.d. 350 (infr. p. 143, cf. p. 93 note). But
   Sievers (ubi supr.), following Mommsen, contends that there is reason
   to think that the dignity of Augustal' Prefect was officially created
   about a.d. 367. This view cannot be adequately discussed here, but it
   rests only in part upon the series of governors furnished by the Festal
   Index.

   From that document we learn that the prefect of Egypt' in the wider
   sense in almost every case held also the office of governor' of Egypt
   in the narrower sense. The exceptions noted by Sievers (Â§14) are in
   most cases based on the errors of Larsow. But in 365 Flavianus is
   governor' only, next year Prefect' also: his successors Proclianus and
   Tatianus are each governor' only (366-7), but the latter is Prefect in
   368, and governor' only in 369-70, as also is Palladius, 370-371, who
   is yet succeeded by Olympius as Prefect.' These variations may be due
   merely to careless use of language, or possibly to some change about
   the time referred to.

   The list of prefects of Egypt is fuller than any that exists for a
   Roman province over so long a period, and on the whole it is in the
   highest degree trustworthy. But there are one or two drawbacks to take
   account of. Firstly, there are the discrepancies between the Index
   iii., vi., vii., and the headings to the corresponding letters (see
   notes). Also, the heading to Letter x. presupposes a change of governor
   in the previous year of which the Index tells us nothing. Again, a
   letter of Julian's (No. 23) is addressed to a Hermogenes, governor of
   Egypt' for whom it is difficult to find room in the following list at
   the date required (end of 361, when Gerontius was prefect). Julianus,
   uncle of the Emperor, if not disguised under the name Italicianus (see
   below), possibly ruled Egypt (Jul. Ep. 11), as Comes Orientis, which
   office he held in 362. On the other hand the Olympus of Index xxxiv.,
   and the Ecdikius of Julian, Epp. 6, 50, and Cod. Theod. xv. i. 8, are
   probably one and the same (Sievers, p. 124).

   The Military command of Egypt was now in the hand of the dux,' who had
   the disposal of the troops in Egypt proper; those of Libya and of the
   Thebais were, at any rate later on, entrusted to separate duces.' In
   the Notitia, while the two latter duces' remain, the Dux Ã†gypti is
   replaced by a higher official, entitled the Comes Rei Militaris per
   Ã†gyptum.' But this belongs to a later date. In the time of Athanasius
   Counts' appear in Egypt only as extraordinary or special commissioners
   whose authority is exercised concurrently with that of the Dux, as,
   e.g., Count Heraclianus or Heraclius (infr. pp. 290, 292), whose
   commission runs parallel with the command of the new dux' Sebastianus;
   and Count Asterius (p. 289), who was in Egypt when Felicissimus was
   Duke.'

   We now give a list of the governors and dukes of Egypt, with references
   to the Festal Index: these must also be supplemented by the general

   Introduction to the Treatise

   Contra Gentes

   ------------------------

   This treatise and that which follows it form in reality two parts of a
   single work. Jerome (De Script. Eccl.) refers to them as Adversus
   Gentes Libri Duo.' They are, however, more commonly distinguished by
   the titles given them in the present volume. Both books, indeed, are
   mainly directed against the Gentiles, but in the present treatise the
   refutation is carried out with more special reference to the beliefs
   and worship of the heathen. The two books belong to the earlier years
   of Athanasius. The Arian controversy which broke out (319 a.d.)
   probably before his twenty-second year has left no trace upon them (not
   even c. Gent. 46. 8, see note there). How long before the limit thus
   fixed the work was composed it is impossible to say with certainty. The
   hint (c. Gent. 9. 5) that the time for the deification of emperors by
   decree of the Senate might have come to an end points to the conversion
   of Constantine as a terminus a quo. And the full maturity of power
   which marks out the de Incarnatione as a masterpiece of Christian
   theology inclines us to put the composition as late as we can. Hence
   the date usually adopted, viz. in or shortly before 318 A.D., the
   twenty-first year (probably) of Athanasius' age.

   The position of the book in relation to the general history of the
   theology of Athanasius and of the Church has been pointed out in the
   Prolegomena. It remains to sketch its argument, and tabulate its
   arrangement: a somewhat more extended summary is prefixed to each
   section.

   His aim is to vindicate (Â§1) the Dignity and reasonableness of the
   Christian Faith. The main vindication of the Faith is seen in its
   practical results. But, that these may produce their proper effect, a
   removal of error from the mind is needed. Hence the necessity of
   refuting idolatry, which is deduced from the same cause as evil in
   general, namely, the departure of man from his original exemplar, the
   Logos (Â§Â§2-5). By the misuse of his power of conscious choice, man fell
   (6-8) into the degradation and illusions (9-15) of idolatry. He then
   examines the popular and learned pleas on behalf of idolatry (16-26),
   and thus arrives at the central problem of the conception of God. That
   God is not Nature is shewn (27-29) by the mutual dependence of the
   various constituents of the Universe: no one of these, therefore, can
   be God: nor can their totality; for God is not compounded of parts on
   which He depends, but is Himself the cause of existence to all. Such a
   God as this, the soul of man (30-33) can and, if purified from sin,
   will (34) recognise; if her imperfections hinder this, the spectacle of
   Reason and Order in the Universe (35-46) will assist her to recognise
   the handiwork of God, and the presence of the Logos, and through him
   the Father. The reclamation and restoration of sinful and degraded man
   can only be effected (47) by a return to the Logos. This opens the
   question dealt with in the second book, de Incarnatione.

   Such is the general drift of the c. Gentes, and its high interest is
   beyond question. At the same time it may be admitted that to modern
   readers much of it fails to commend itself. In the two-fold work before
   us Athanasius looks before and after.' The second portion, on the
   Incarnation, waxes rather than wanes in its significance for modern
   theology. It is more modern to us than the theology of any generation
   since then. But the c. Gentes, with its retrospect upon a past utterly
   dead [100] to the human spirit, its arguments addressed to a range of
   ideas widely remote from our own, its inadequate view of the genesis
   and history of heathen religions, its antiquated physics (36, 44, and
   the phusikos logos of 39), its occasional glaring fallacies of argument
   (16 sub fin., 33. 1), is apt to disappoint the modern student who reads
   it for the first time. This may explain its not having been translated
   before now. But while the defects of the book are evident at a glance,
   it grows upon the reader with repeated study. The moral elevation of
   its tone,--the firm grasp of central Christian truths,--the sure
   insight in dealing with such problems as evil and sin,--the relation of
   God to Nature,--the ethical contrast of Christian theism and heathen
   polytheism,--the grave humour of such passages as 16. 5; 10. 4 fin.;
   II. 2 fin., &c.,--and beyond all this a certain largeness of mind and
   simple unostentatious fervour of conviction, stamp the book as a great
   one, and as the worthy complement of its more renowned companion.

   The two together are, next to Origen's de Principiis, the first attempt
   to construct a scientific system of the Christian religion upon certain
   fundamental ideas of God and world, sin and redemption; and they form
   the ripe fruit of the positive apology in the Greek Church.' (Schaff,
   Nicene Christianity, p. 82.) The polemic against idolatry and heathen
   mythology is common to the general class of Christian apologists, and
   is to be found in heathen writers like Lucian and even Porphyry (letter
   to Anebo). But what distinguishes Athanasius from previous apologists
   (excepting Origen) is the novel nature of his problem. The alliance
   between philosophy and gross popular idolatry had given Christian
   apology a new task. From Porphyry downwards (Porphyry himself was not
   consistent in this respect) the Neo-platonist school, in alarm at the
   progress of Christianity, had taken up the defence of popular paganism,
   endeavouring to subsume its grosser manifestations, its images,
   sacrifices, &c., under philosophico-religious principles (infra Â§19,
   &c.). The idea of theurgy' as the necessary initiation into the higher
   life colours the teaching of Porphyry, but more strongly that of his
   pupil Iamblichus, who died early in the fourth century, and whose
   pupils (Ã†desius, &c.) were contemporaries of Athanasius. This
   degeneration of Platonism, however, went along with the continued study
   of Plato, whose dialogues are to some extent common ground between
   Athanasius and his opponents (PhÃ¦drus, Â§5, 33, Laws, 33, TimÃ¦us, 41,
   &c., &c.; but it is not in every case easy to say whether Athan. quotes
   Plato merely at second hand, or directly, as he certainly does 10. 4).

   It may be remarked finally that in these early treatises the influence
   of Origen and his school is more distinct than in the later works of
   Athanasius. Not to lay too much stress on his proof of God's existence
   and unity from the Cosmos (cf. Orig. c. Cels. I. 23), the prominence of
   the philosophic doctrine of the Logos as a cosmic mediatorial Principle
   (compare Alexander's mesiteuousa phusis monogenes) stands in contrast
   with his later insistence (cf. Orat. ii. 24, sq.) on the directness of
   the personal agency of God (see also below, note on In Illud' 2). The
   Platonist idea of the Logos is utilised (de Incarn. 41) without
   sufficient explanation of its fundamental difference from the Christian
   doctrine. The influence of Origenism is traceable in his theory of the
   nature of evil as purely negative (cf. Â§5 with Orig. c. Cels. iv. 66),
   in the explanation (to which I recall nothing parallel in his later
   works) of the garden of Eden as figurative (2. 4, cf. 3. 3), the stress
   laid on the restoration of knowledge of God through the Logos, and
   perhaps in the deification of man through Christ (Orig. c. Cels. iii.
   28 sub. fin.), a thought which Athanasius brings forward in his later
   at least as often as in his earlier writings (see note on de Incarn.
   54. 3). On the whole, however, the tendency of Athanasius in the course
   of the Arian controversy is to move away from Origen and toward the
   Western habit of thought: this is especially exemplified in the history
   of the term Hypostasis (see above, Prolegg. chap. II. Â§3 (2) b, and
   below Introd. to Tom. ad Ant.; cf. also Introductions to de Sent.
   Dionys. and ad Afros). Some of the more characteristic speculations of
   Origen have left no trace even on the earliest works of Athanasius (see
   Introd. to the next Treatise). The translation (here as elsewhere,
   except where it is otherwise stated) is from the Benedictine text.

   Against the Heathen.

   ------------------------

   Â§1. Introduction:--The purpose of the book a vindication of Christian
   doctrine, and especially of the Cross, against the scoffing objection
   of Gentiles. The effects of this doctrine its main vindication.

   The knowledge of our religion and of the truth of things is
   independently manifest rather than in need of human teachers, for
   almost day by day it asserts itself by facts, and manifests itself
   brighter than the sun by the doctrine of Christ. 2. Still, as you
   nevertheless desire to hear about it, Macarius [101] , come let us as
   we may be able set forth a few points of the faith of Christ: able
   though you are to find it out from the divine oracles, but yet
   generously desiring to hear from others as well. 3. For although the
   sacred and inspired Scriptures are sufficient [102] to declare the
   truth,--while there are other works of our blessed teachers [103]
   compiled for this purpose, if he meet with which a man will gain some
   knowledge of the interpretation of the Scriptures, and be able to learn
   what he wishes to know,--still, as we have not at present in our hands
   the compositions of our teachers, we must communicate in writing to you
   what we learned from them,--the faith, namely, of Christ the Saviour;
   lest any should hold cheap the doctrine taught among us, or think faith
   in Christ unreasonable. For this is what the Gentiles traduce and scoff
   at, and laugh loudly at us, insisting on the one fact of the Cross of
   Christ; and it is just here that one must pity their want of sense,
   because when they traduce the Cross of Christ they do not see that its
   power has filled all the world, and that by it the effects of the
   knowledge of God are made manifest to all. 4. For they would not have
   scoffed at such a fact, had they, too, been men who genuinely gave heed
   to His divine Nature. On the contrary, they in their turn would have
   recognised this man as Saviour of the world, and that the Cross has
   been not a disaster, but a healing of Creation. 5. For if after the
   Cross all idolatry was overthrown, while every manifestation of demons
   is driven away by this Sign [104] , and Christ alone is worshipped and
   the Father known through Him, and, while gainsayers are put to shame,
   He daily invisibly wins over the souls of these gainsayers [105]
   ,--how, one might fairly ask them, is it still open to us to regard the
   matter as human, instead of confessing that He Who ascended the Cross
   is Word of God and Saviour of the World? But these men seem to me quite
   as bad as one who should traduce the sun when covered by clouds, while
   yet wondering at his light, seeing how the whole of creation is
   illumined by him. 6. For as the light is noble, and the sun, the chief
   cause of light, is nobler still, so, as it is a divine thing for the
   whole world to be filled with his knowledge, it follows that the
   orderer and chief cause of such an achievement is God and the Word of
   God. 7. We speak then as lies within our power, first refuting the
   ignorance of the unbelieving; so that what is false being refuted, the
   truth may then shine forth of itself, and that you yourself, friend,
   may be reassured that you have believed what is true, and in coming to
   know Christ have not been deceived. Moreover, I think it becoming to
   discourse to you, as a lover of Christ, about Christ, since I am sure
   that you rate faith in and knowledge of Him above anything else
   whatsoever.

   Â§2. Evil no part of the essential nature of things. The original
   creation and constitution of man in grace and in the knowledge of God.

   In the beginning wickedness did not exist. Nor indeed does it exist
   even now in those who are holy, nor does it in any way belong to their
   nature. But men later on began to contrive it and to elaborate it to
   their own hurt. Whence also they devised the invention of idols,
   treating what was not as though it were. 2. For God Maker of all and
   King of all, that has His Being beyond [106] all substance and human
   discovery, inasmuch as He is good and exceeding noble, made, through
   His own Word our Saviour Jesus Christ, the human race after His own
   image, and constituted man able to see and know realities by means of
   this assimilation to Himself, giving him also a conception [107] and
   knowledge even of His own eternity, in order that, preserving his
   nature intact, he might not ever either depart from his idea of God,
   nor recoil from the communion of the holy ones; but having the grace of
   Him that gave it, having also God's own power from the Word of the
   Father, he might rejoice and have fellowship with the Deity, living the
   life of immortality unharmed and truly blessed. For having nothing to
   hinder his knowledge of the Deity, he ever beholds, by his purity, the
   Image of the Father, God the Word, after Whose image he himself is
   made. He is awe-struck as he contemplates that Providence [108] which
   through the Word extends to the universe, being raised above the things
   of sense and every bodily appearance, but cleaving to the divine and
   thought-perceived things in the heavens by the power of his mind. 3.
   For when the mind of men does not hold converse with bodies, nor has
   mingled with it from without aught of their lust, but is wholly above
   them, dwelling with itself as it was made to begin with, then,
   transcending the things of sense and all things human, it is raised up
   on high; and seeing the Word, it sees in Him also the Father of the
   Word, taking pleasure in contemplating Him, and gaining renewal by its
   desire toward Him; 4. exactly as the first of men created, the one who
   was named Adam in Hebrew, is described in the Holy Scriptures as having
   at the beginning had his mind to God-ward in a freedom unembarrassed by
   shame, and as associating with the holy ones in that contemplation of
   things perceived by the mind which he enjoyed in the place where he
   was--the place which the holy Moses called in figure a Garden. So
   purity of soul is sufficient of itself to reflect God, as the Lord also
   says, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."

   Â§3. The decline of man from the above condition, owing to his
   absorption in material things.

   Thus then, as we have said, the Creator fashioned the race of men, and
   thus meant it to remain. But men, making light of better things, and
   holding back from apprehending them, began to seek in preference things
   nearer to themselves. 2. But nearer to themselves were the body and its
   senses; so that while removing their mind from the things perceived by
   thought, they began to regard themselves; and so doing, and holding to
   the body and the other things of sense, and deceived as it were in
   their own surroundings, they fell into lust of themselves, preferring
   what was their own to the contemplation of what belonged to God. Having
   then made themselves at home in these things, and not being willing to
   leave what was so near to them, they entangled their soul with bodily
   pleasures, vexed and turbid with all kind of lusts, while they wholly
   forgot the power they originally had from God. 3. But the truth of this
   one may see from the man who was first made, according to what the holy
   Scriptures tell us of him. For he also, as long as he kept his mind to
   God, and the contemplation of God, turned away from the contemplation
   of the body. But when, by counsel of the serpent, he departed from the
   consideration of God, and began to regard himself, then they not only
   fell to bodily lust, but knew that they were naked, and knowing, were
   ashamed. But they knew that they were naked, not so much of clothing as
   that they were become stripped of the contemplation of divine things,
   and had transferred their understanding to the contraries. For having
   departed from the consideration of the one and the true, namely, God,
   and from desire of Him, they had thenceforward embarked in divers lusts
   and in those of the several bodily senses. 4. Next, as is apt to
   happen, having formed a desire for each and sundry, they began to be
   habituated to these desires, so that they were even afraid to leave
   them: whence the soul became subject to cowardice and alarms, and
   pleasures and thoughts of mortality. For not being willing to leave her
   lusts, she fears death and her separation from the body. But again,
   from lusting, and not meeting with gratification, she learned to commit
   murder and wrong. We are then led naturally to shew, as best we can,
   how she does this.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§4. The gradual abasement of the Soul from Truth to Falsehood by the
   abuse of her freedom of Choice.

   Having departed from the contemplation of the things of thought, and
   using to the full the several activities of the body, and being pleased
   with the contemplation of the body, and seeing that pleasure is good
   for her, she was misled and abused the name of good, and thought that
   pleasure was the very essence of good: just as though a man out of his
   mind and asking for a sword to use against all he met, were to think
   that soundness of mind. 2. But having fallen in love with pleasure, she
   began to work it out in various ways. For being by nature mobile, even
   though she have turned away from what is good, yet she does not lose
   her mobility. She moves then, no longer according to virtue or so as to
   see God, but imagining false things, she makes a novel use of her
   power, abusing it as a means to the pleasures she has devised, since
   she is after all made with power over herself. 3. For she is able, as
   on the one hand to incline to what is good, so on the other to reject
   it; but in rejecting the good she of course entertains the thought of
   what is opposed to it, for she cannot at all cease from movement,
   being, as I said before, mobile by nature. And knowing her own power
   over herself, she sees that she is able to use the members of her body
   in either direction, both toward what is, or toward what is not. 4. But
   good is, while evil is not; by what is, then, I mean what is good,
   inasmuch as it has its pattern in God Who is. But by what is not I mean
   what is evil, in so far as it consists in a false imagination in the
   thoughts of men. For though the body has eyes so as to see Creation,
   and by its entirely harmonious construction to recognise the Creator;
   and ears to listen to the divine oracles and the laws of God; and hands
   both to perform works of necessity and to raise to God in prayer; yet
   the soul, departing from the contemplation of what is good and from
   moving in its sphere, wanders away and moves toward its contraries. 5.
   Then seeing, as I said before, and abusing her power, she has perceived
   that she can move the members of the body also in an opposite way: and
   so, instead of beholding the Creation, she turns the eye to lusts,
   shewing that she has this power too; and thinking that by the mere fact
   of moving she is maintaining her own dignity, and is doing no sin in
   doing as she pleases; not knowing that she is made not merely to move,
   but to move in the right direction. For this is why an apostolic
   utterance assures us "All things are lawful, but not all things are
   expedient [109] ."

   Â§5. Evil, then consists essentially in the choice of what is lower in
   preference to what is higher.

   But the audacity of men, having regard not to what is expedient and
   becoming, but to what is possible for it, began to do the contrary;
   whence, moving their hands to the contrary, it made them commit murder,
   and led away their hearing to disobedience, and their other members to
   adultery instead of to lawful procreation; and the tongue, instead of
   right speaking, to slander and insult and perjury; the hands again, to
   stealing and striking fellow-men; and the sense of smell to many sorts
   of lascivious odours; the feet, to be swift to shed blood, and the
   belly to drunkenness and insatiable gluttony [110] . 2. All of which
   things are a vice and sin of the soul: neither is there any cause of
   them at all, but only the rejection of better things. For just as if a
   charioteer [111] , having mounted his chariot on the race-course, were
   to pay no attention to the goal, toward which he should be driving,
   but, ignoring this, simply were to drive the horse as he could, or in
   other words as he would, and often drive against those he met, and
   often down steep places, rushing wherever he impelled himself by the
   speed of the team, thinking that thus running he has not missed the
   goal,--for he regards the running only, and does not see that he has
   passed wide of the goal;--so the soul too, turning from the way toward
   God, and driving the members of the body beyond what is proper, or
   rather, driven herself along with them by her own doing, sins and makes
   mischief for herself, not seeing that she has strayed from the way, and
   has swerved from the goal of truth, to which the Christ-bearing man,
   the blessed Paul, was looking when he said, "I press on toward the goal
   unto the prize of the high calling of Christ Jesus [112] :" so that the
   holy man, making the good his mark, never did what was evil.

   Â§6. False views of the nature of evil: viz., that evil is something in
   the nature of things, and has substantive existence. (a) Heathen
   thinkers: (evil resides in matter). Their refutation. (b) Heretical
   teachers: (Dualism). Refutation from Scripture.

   Now certain of the Greeks, having erred from the right way, and not
   having known Christ, have ascribed to evil a substantive and
   independent existence. In this they make a double mistake: either in
   denying the Creator to be maker of all things, if evil had an
   independent subsistence and being of its own; or again, if they mean
   that He is maker of all things, they will of necessity admit Him to be
   maker of evil also. For evil, according to them, is included among
   existing things. 2. But this must appear paradoxical and impossible.
   For evil does not come from good, nor is it in, or the result of, good,
   since in that case it would not be good, being mixed in its nature or a
   cause of evil. 3. But the sectaries, who have fallen away from the
   teaching of the Church, and made shipwreck concerning the Faith [113] ,
   they also wrongly think that evil has a substantive existence. But they
   arbitrarily imagine another god besides the true One, the Father of our
   Lord Jesus Christ, and that he is the unmade producer of evil and the
   head of wickedness, who is also artificer of Creation. But these men
   one can easily refute, not only from the divine Scriptures, but also
   from the human understanding itself, the very source of these their
   insane imaginations. 4. To begin with, our Lord and Saviour Jesus
   Christ says in His own gospels confirming the words of Moses: "The Lord
   God is one;" and "I thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth [114]
   ." But if God is one, and at the same time Lord of heaven and earth,
   how could there be another God beside Him? or what room will there be
   for the God whom they suppose, if the one true God fills all things in
   the compass of heaven and earth? or how could there be another creator
   of that, whereof, according to the Saviour's utterance, the God and
   Father of Christ is Himself Lord? 5. Unless indeed they would say that
   it were, so to speak, in an equipoise, and the evil god capable of
   getting the better of the good God. But if they say this, see to what a
   pitch of impiety they descend. For when powers are equal, the superior
   and better cannot be discovered. For if the one exist even if the other
   will it not, both are equally strong and equally weak equally, because
   the very existence of either is a defeat of the other's will: weak,
   because what happens is counter to their wills: for while the good God
   exists in spite of the evil one, the evil god exists equally in spite
   of the good.

   Â§7. Refutation of dualism from reason. Impossibility of two Gods. The
   truth as to evil is that which the Church teaches: that it originates,
   and resides, in the perverted choice of the darkened soul.

   More especially, they are exposed to the following reply. If visible
   things are the work of the evil god, what is the work of the good God?
   for nothing is to be seen except the work of the Artificer. Or what
   evidence is there that the good God exists at all, if there are no
   works of His by which He may be known? for by his works the artificer
   is known. 2. Or how could two principles exist, contrary one to
   another: or what is it that divides them, for them to exist apart? For
   it is impossible for them to exist together, because they are mutually
   destructive. But neither can the one be included in the other, their
   nature being unmixed and unlike. Accordingly that which divides them
   will evidently be of a third nature, and itself God. But of what nature
   could this third something be? good or evil? It will be impossible to
   determine, for it cannot be of the nature of both. 3. This conceit of
   theirs, then, being evidently rotten, the truth of the Church's
   theology must be manifest: that evil has not from the beginning been
   with God or in God, nor has any substantive existence; but that men, in
   default of the vision of good, began to devise and imagine for
   themselves what was not, after their own pleasure. 4. For as if a man,
   when the sun is shining, and the whole earth illumined by his light,
   were to shut fast his eyes and imagine darkness where no darkness
   exists, and then walk wandering as if in darkness, often falling and
   going down steep places, thinking it was dark and not light,--for,
   imagining that he sees, he does not see at all;--so, too, the soul of
   man, shutting fast her eyes, by which she is able to see God, has
   imagined evil for herself, and moving therein, knows not that, thinking
   she is doing something, she is doing nothing. For she is imagining what
   is not, nor is she abiding in her original nature; but what she is is
   evidently the product of her own disorder. 5. For she is made to see
   God, and to be enlightened by Him; but of her own accord in God's stead
   she has sought corruptible things and darkness, as the Spirit says
   somewhere in writing, "God made man upright, but they have sought out
   many inventions [115] ." Thus it has been then that men from the first
   discovered and contrived and imagined evil for themselves. But it is
   now time to say how they came down to the madness of idolatry, that you
   may know that the invention of idols is wholly due, not to good but to
   evil. But what has its origin in evil can never be pronounced good in
   any point,--being evil altogether.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [115] Eccl. vii. 29.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§8. The origin of idolatry is similar. The soul, materialised by
   forgetting God, and engrossed in earthly things, makes them into gods.
   The race of men descends into a hopeless depth of delusion and
   superstition.

   Now the soul of mankind, not satisfied with the devising of evil, began
   by degrees to venture upon what is worse still. For having experience
   of diversities of pleasures, and girt about with oblivion of things
   divine; being pleased moreover and having in view the passions of the
   body, and nothing but things present and opinions about them, ceased to
   think that anything existed beyond what is seen, or that anything was
   good save things temporal and bodily; so turning away and forgetting
   that she was in the image of the good God, she no longer, by the power
   which is in her, sees God the Word after whose likeness she is made;
   but having departed from herself, imagines and feigns what is not. 2.
   For hiding, by the complications of bodily lusts, the mirror which, as
   it were, is in her, by which alone she had the power of seeing the
   Image of the Father, she no longer sees what a soul ought to behold,
   but is carried about by everything, and only sees the things which come
   under the senses. Hence, weighted with all fleshly desire, and
   distracted among the impressions of these things, she imagines that the
   God Whom her understanding has forgotten is to be found in bodily and
   sensible things, giving to things seen the name of God, and glorifying
   only those things which she desires and which are pleasant to her eyes.
   3. Accordingly, evil is the cause which brings idolatry in its train;
   for men, having learned to contrive evil, which is no reality in
   itself, in like manner feigned for themselves as gods beings that had
   no real existence. Just, then, as though a man had plunged into the
   deep, and no longer saw the light, nor what appears by light, because
   his eyes are turned downwards, and the water is all above him; and,
   perceiving only the things in the deep, thinks that nothing exists
   beside them, but that the things he sees are the only true realities;
   so the men of former time, having lost their reason, and plunged into
   the lusts and imaginations of carnal things, and forgotten the
   knowledge and glory of God, their reasoning being dull, or rather
   following unreason, made gods for themselves of things seen, glorifying
   the creature rather than the Creator [116] , and deifying the works
   rather than the Master, God, their Cause and Artificer. 4. But just as,
   according to the above simile, men who plunge into the deep, the deeper
   they go down, advance into darker and deeper places, so it is with
   mankind. For they did not keep to idolatry in a simple form, nor did
   they abide in that with which they began; but the longer they went on
   in their first condition, the more new superstitions they invented:
   and, not satiated with the first evils, they again filled themselves.
   with others, advancing further in utter shamefulness, and surpassing
   themselves in impiety. But to this the divine Scripture testifies when
   it says, "When the wicked cometh unto the depth of evils, he despiseth
   [117] ."

   Â§9. The various developments of idolatry: worship of the heavenly
   bodies, the elements, natural objects, fabulous creatures, personified
   lusts, men living and dead. The case of Antinous, and of the deified
   Emperors.

   For now the understanding of mankind leaped asunder from God; and going
   lower in their ideas and imaginations, they gave the honour due to God
   first to the heaven and the sun and moon and the stars, thinking them
   to be not only gods, but also the causes of the other gods lower than
   themselves [118] . Then, going yet lower in their dark imaginations,
   they gave the name of gods to the upper Ã¦ther and the air and the
   things in the air. Next, advancing further in evil, they came to
   celebrate as gods the elements and the principles of which bodies are
   composed, heat and cold and dryness and wetness. 2. But just as they
   who have fallen flat creep in the slime like land-snails, so the most
   impious of mankind, having fallen lower and lower from the idea of God,
   then set up as gods men, and the forms of men, some still living,
   others even after their death. Moreover, counselling and imagining
   worse things still, they transferred the divine and supernatural name
   of God at last even to stones and stocks, and creeping things both of
   land and water, and irrational wild beasts, awarding to them every
   divine honour, and turning from the true and only real God, the Father
   of Christ. 3. But would that even there the audacity of these foolish
   men had stopped short, and that they had not gone further yet in
   impious self-confusion. For to such a depth have some fallen in their
   understanding, to such darkness of mind, that they have even devised
   for themselves, and made gods of things that have no existence at all,
   nor any place among things created. For mixing up the rational with the
   irrational, and combining things unlike in nature, they worship the
   result as gods, such as the dog-headed and snake-headed and ass-headed
   gods among the Egyptians, and the ram-headed Ammon among the Libyans.
   While others, dividing apart the portions of men's bodies, head,
   shoulder, hand, and foot, have set up each as gods and deified them, as
   though their religion were not satisfied with the whole body in its
   integrity. 4. But others, straining impiety to the utmost, have deified
   the motive of the invention of these things and of their own
   wickedness, namely, pleasure and lust, and worship them, such as their
   Eros, and the Aphrodite at Paphos. While some of them, as if vying with
   them in depravation, have ventured to erect into gods their rulers or
   even their sons, either out of honour for their princes, or from fear
   of their tyranny, such as the Cretan Zeus, of such renown among them,
   and the Arcadian Hermes; and among the Indians Dionysus, among the
   Egyptians Isis and Osiris and Horus, and in our own time Antinous,
   favourite of Hadrian, Emperor of the Romans, whom, although men know he
   was a mere man, and not a respectable man, but on the contrary, full of
   licentiousness, yet they worship for fear of him that enjoined it. For
   Hadrian having come to sojourn in the land of Egypt, when Antinous the
   minister of his pleasure died, ordered him to be worshipped; being
   indeed himself in love with the youth even after his death, but for all
   that offering a convincing exposure of himself, and a proof against all
   idolatry, that it was discovered among men for no other reason than by
   reason of the lust of them that imagined it. According as the wisdom of
   God testifies beforehand when it says, "The devising of idols was the
   beginning of fornication [119] ." 5. And do not wonder, nor think what
   we are saying hard to believe, inasmuch as it is not long since, even
   if it be not still the case that the Roman Senate vote to those
   emperors who have ever ruled them from the beginning, either all of
   them, or such as they wish and decide, a place among the gods, and
   decree them to be worshipped [120] . For those to whom they are
   hostile, they treat as enemies and call men, admitting their real
   nature, while those who are popular with them they order to be
   worshipped on account of their virtue, as though they had it in their
   own power to make gods, though they are themselves men, and do not
   profess to be other than mortal. 6. Whereas if they are to make gods,
   they ought to be themselves gods; for that which makes must needs be
   better than that which it makes, and he that judges is of necessity in
   authority over him that is judged, while he that gives, at any rate
   that which he has, confers a layout, just as, of course, every king, in
   giving as a favour what he has to give, is greater and in a higher
   position than those who receive. If then they decree whomsoever they
   please to be gods, they ought first to be gods themselves. But the
   strange thing is this, that they themselves by dying as men, expose the
   falsehood of their own vote concerning those deified by them.

   Â§10. Similar human origin of the Greek gods, by decree of Theseus. The
   process by which mortals became deified.

   But this custom is not a new one, nor did it begin from the Roman
   Senate: on the contrary, it had existed previously from of old, and was
   formerly practised for the devising of idols. For the gods renowned
   from of old among the Greeks, Zeus, Poseidon, Apollo, HephÃ¦stus,
   Hermes, and, among females, Hera and Demeter and Athena and Artemis,
   were decreed the title of gods by the order of Theseus, of whom Greek
   history tells us [121] ; and so the men who pass such decrees die like
   men and are mourned for, while those in whose favour they are passed
   are worshipped as gods. What a height of inconsistency and madness!
   knowing who passed the decree, they pay greater honour to those who are
   the subjects of it. 2. And would that their idolatrous madness had
   stopped short at males, and that they had not brought down the title of
   deity to females. For even women, whom it is not safe to admit to
   deliberation about public affairs, they worship and serve with the
   honour due to God, such as those enjoined by Theseus as above stated,
   and among the Egyptians [122] Isis and the Maid and the Younger one
   [123] , and among others Aphrodite. For the names of the others I do
   not consider it modest even to mention, full as they are of all kind of
   grotesqueness. 3. For many, not only in ancient times but in our own
   also, having lost their beloved ones, brothers and kinsfolk and wives;
   and many women who had lost their husbands, all of whom nature proved
   to be mortal men, made representations of them and devised sacrifices,
   and consecrated them; while later ages, moved by the figure and the
   brilliancy of the artist, worshipped them as gods, thus falling into
   inconsistency with nature [124] . For whereas their parents had mourned
   for them, not regarding them as gods (for had they known them to be
   gods they would not have lamented them as if they had perished; for
   this was why they represented them in an image, namely, because they
   not only did not think them gods, but did not believe them to exist at
   all, and in order that the sight of their form in the image might
   console them for their being no more), yet the foolish people pray to
   them as gods and invest them with the honour of the true God. 4. For
   example, in Egypt, even to this day, the death-dirge is celebrated for
   Osiris and Horus and Typho and the others. And the caldrons [125] at
   Dodona, and the Corybantes in Crete, prove that Zeus is no god but a
   man, and a man born of a cannibal father. And, strange to say, even
   Plato, the sage admired among the Greeks, with all his vaunted
   understanding about God, goes down with Socrates to PeirÃ¦us [126] to
   worship Artemis, a figment of man's art.

   taught us beforehand long ago, when it said [127] , "The devising of
   idols was the beginning of fornication, and the invention of them, the
   corruption of life. For neither were they from the beginning, neither
   shall they be for ever. For the vainglory of men they entered into the
   world, and therefore shall they come shortly to an end. For a father
   afflicted with untimely mourning when he hath made an image of his
   child soon taken away, now honoured him as a god which was then a dead
   man, and delivered to those that were under him ceremonies and
   sacrifices. Thus in process of time an ungodly custom grown strong was
   kept as a law. And graven images were worshipped by the commands of
   kings. Whom men could not honour in presence because they dwelt afar
   off, they took the counterfeit of his visage from afar, and made an
   express image of the king whom they honoured, to the end that by this
   their forwardness they might flatter him that was absent as if he were
   present. Also the singular diligence of the artificer did help to set
   forward the ignorant to more superstition: for he, peradventure,
   willing to please one in authority, forced all his skill to make the
   resemblance of the best fashion: and so the multitude, allured by the
   grace of the work, took him now for a god, which a little before was
   but honoured as a man: and this was an occasion to deceive the world,
   for men serving either calamity or tyranny, did ascribe unto stones and
   stocks the incommunicable Name." 2. The beginning and devising of the
   invention of idols having been, as Scripture witnesses, of such sort,
   it is now time to shew thee the refutation of it by proofs derived not
   so much from without as from these men's own opinions about the idols.
   For to begin at the lowest point, if one were to take the actions of
   them they call gods, one would find that they were not only no gods,
   but had been even of men the most contemptible. For what a thing it is
   to see the loves and licentious actions of Zeus in the poets! What a
   thing to hear of him, on the one hand carrying off Ganymede and
   committing stealthy adulteries, on the other in panic and alarm lest
   the walls of the Trojans should be destroyed against his intentions!
   What a thing to see him in grief at the death of his son Sarpedon, and
   wishing to succour him without being able to do so, and, when plotted
   against by the other so-called gods, namely, Athena and Hera and
   Poseidon, succoured by Thetis, a woman, and by Ã†gaeon of the hundred
   hands, and overcome by pleasures, a slave to women, and for their sakes
   running adventures in disguises consisting of brute beasts and creeping
   things and birds; and again, in hiding on account of his father's
   designs upon him, or Cronos bound by him, or him again mutilating his
   father! Why, is it fitting to regard as a god one who has perpetrated
   such deeds, and who stands accused of things which not even the public
   laws of the Romans allow those to do who are merely men?

   Â§12. Other shameful actions ascribed to heathen deities. All prove that
   they are but men of former times, and not even good men.

   For, to mention a few instances out of many to avoid prolixity, who
   that saw his lawless and corrupt conduct toward Semele, Leda, Alcmene,
   Artemis, Leto, Maia, Europe, Danae, and Antiope, or that saw what he
   ventured to take in hand with regard to his own sister, in having the
   same woman as wife and sister, would not scorn him and pronounce him
   worthy of death? For not only did he commit adultery, but he deified
   and raised to heaven those born of his adulteries, contriving the
   deification as a veil for his lawlessness: such as Dionysus, Heracles,
   the Dioscuri, Hermes, Perseus, and Soteira. 2. Who, that sees the
   so-called gods at irreconcileable strife among themselves at Troy on
   account of the Greeks and Trojans, will fail to recognise their
   feebleness, in that because of their mutual jealousies they egged on
   even mortals to strife? Who, that sees Ares and Aphrodite wounded by
   Diomed, or Hera and AÃ¯doneus from below the earth, whom they call a
   god, wounded by Heracles, Dionysus by Perseus, Athena by Arcas, and
   HephÃ¦stus hurled down and going lame, will not recognise their real
   nature, and, while refusing to call them gods, be assured (when he
   hears that they are corruptible and passible) that they are nothing but
   men [128] , and feeble men too, and admire those that inflicted the
   wounds rather than the wounded? 3. Or who that sees the adultery of
   Ares with Aphrodite, and HephÃ¦stus contriving a snare for the two, and
   the other so-called gods called by HephÃ¦stus to view the adultery, and
   coming and seeing their licentiousness, would not laugh and recognise
   their worthless character? Or who would not laugh at beholding the
   drunken folly and misconduct of Heracles toward Omphale? For their
   deeds of pleasure, and their unconscionable loves, and their divine
   images in gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, we need not
   seriously expose by argument, since the facts are abominable in
   themselves, and are enough taken alone to furnish proof of the
   deception; so that one's principal feeling is pity for those deceived
   about them. 4. For, hating the adulterer who tampers with a wife of
   their own, they are not ashamed to deify the teachers of adultery; and
   refraining from incest themselves they worship those who practise it;
   and admitting that the corrupting of children is an evil, they serve
   those who stand accused of it and do not blush to ascribe to those they
   call gods things which the laws forbid to exist even among men.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [128] This explanation of gods as deified men is known as Euhemerism,
   from Euhemerus, who broached the theory in the third century, b.c.
   (supra, 10, note 1); but there were Euhemerists in Greece before
   Euhemerus' (Jowett's Plato, 2. 101). The Fathers very commonly adopt
   the theory, for which, however, there are very slight grounds. Such
   cases as those of Antinous and the Emperors, as well as the legends of
   heroes and demigods, gave it some plausibility (see DÃ¶llinger; Gentile
   and Jew, vol. i. p. 344, Eng. Tr.).
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§13. The folly of image worship and its dishonour to art.

   Again, in worshipping things of wood and stone, they do not see that,
   while they tread under foot and burn what is in no way different, they
   call portions of these materials gods. And what they made use of a
   little while ago, they carve and worship in their folly, not seeing,
   nor at all considering that they are worshipping, not gods, but the
   carver's art. 2. For so long as the stone is uncut and the wood
   unworked, they walk upon the one and make frequent use of the other for
   their own purposes, even for those which are less honourable. But when
   the artist has invested them with the proportions of his own skill, and
   impressed upon the material the form of man or woman, then, thanking
   the artist, they proceed to worship them as gods, having bought them
   from the carver at a price. Often, moreover, the image-maker, as though
   forgetting the work he has done himself, prays to his own productions,
   and calls gods what just before he was paring and chipping. 3. But it
   were better, if need to admire these things, to ascribe it to the art
   of the skilled workman, and not to honour productions in preference to
   their producer. For it is not the material that has adorned the art,
   but the art that has adorned and deified the material. Much juster were
   it, then, for them to worship the artist than his productions, both
   because his existence was prior to that of the gods produced by art,
   and because they have come into being in the form he pleased to give
   them. But as it is, setting justice aside, and dishonouring skill and
   art, they worship the products of skill and art, and when the man is
   dead that made them, they honour his works as immortal, whereas if they
   did not receive daily attention they would certainly in time come to a
   natural end. 4. Or how could one fail to pity them in this also, in
   that seeing, they worship them that cannot see, and hearing, pray to
   them that cannot hear, and born with life and reason, men as they are,
   call gods things which do not move at all, but have not even life, and,
   strangest of all, in that they serve as their masters beings whom they
   themselves keep under their own power? Nor imagine that this is a mere
   statement of mine, nor that I am maligning them; for the verification
   of all this meets the eyes, and whoever wishes to do so may see the
   like.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§14. Image worship condemned by Scripture.

   But better testimony about all this is furnished by Holy Scripture,
   which tells us beforehand when it says [129] , "Their idols are silver
   and gold, the work of men's hands. Eyes have they and will not see; a
   mouth have they and will not speak; ears have they and will not hear;
   noses have they and will not smell; hands have they and will not
   handle; feet have they and will not walk; they will not speak through
   their throat. Like unto them be they that make them." Nor have they
   escaped prophetic censure; for there also is their refutation, where
   the Spirit says [130] , "they shall be ashamed that have formed a god,
   and carved all of them that which is vain: and all by whom they were
   made are dried up: and let the deaf ones among men all assemble and
   stand up together, and let them be confounded and put to shame
   together; for the carpenter sharpened iron, and worked it with an adze,
   and fashioned it with an auger, and set it up with the arm of his
   strength: and he shall hunger and be faint, and drink no water. For the
   carpenter chose out wood, and set it by a rule, and fashioned it with
   glue, and made it as the form of a man and as the beauty of man, and
   set it up in his house, wood which he had cut from the grove and which
   the Lord planted, and the rain gave it growth that it might be for men
   to burn, and that he might take thereof and warm himself, and kindle,
   and bake bread upon it, but the residue they made into gods, and
   worshipped them, the half whereof they had burned in the fire. And upon
   the half thereof he roasted flesh and ate and was filled, and was
   warmed and said: It is pleasant to me, because I am warmed and have
   seen the fire.' But the residue thereof he worshipped, saying, Deliver
   me for thou art my god.' They knew not nor understood, because their
   eyes were dimmed that they could not see, nor perceive with their
   heart; nor did he consider in his heart nor know in his understanding
   that he had burned half thereof in the fire, and baked bread upon the
   coals thereof, and roasted flesh and eaten it, and made the residue
   thereof an abomination, and they worship it. Know that their heart is
   dust and they are deceived, and none can deliver his soul. Behold and
   will ye not say, There is a lie in my right hand?'" 2. How then can
   they fail to be judged godless by all, who even by the divine Scripture
   are accused of impiety? or how can they be anything but miserable, who
   are thus openly convicted of worshipping dead things instead of the
   truth? or what kind of hope have they? or what kind of excuse could be
   made for them, trusting in things without sense or movement, which they
   reverence in place of the true God?

   Â§15. The details about the gods conveyed in the representations of them
   by poets and artists shew that they are without life, and that they are
   not gods, nor even decent men and women.

   For would that the artist would fashion the gods even without shape, so
   that they might not be open to so manifest an exposure of their lack of
   sense. For they might have cajoled the perception of simple folk to
   think the idols had senses, were it not that they possess the symbols
   of the senses, eyes for example and noses and ears and hands and mouth,
   without any gesture of actual perception and grasp of the objects of
   sense. But as a matter of fact they have these things and have them
   not, stand and stand not, sit and sit not. For they have not the real
   action of these things, but as their fashioner pleased, so they remain
   stationary, giving no sign of a god, but evidently mere inanimate
   objects, set there by man's art. 2. Or would that the heralds and
   prophets of these false gods, poets I mean and writers, had simply
   written that they were gods, and not also recounted their actions as an
   exposure of their godlessness and scandalous life. For by the mere name
   of godhead they might have filched away the truth, or rather have
   caused the mass of men to err from the truth. But as it is, by
   narrating the loves and immoralities of Zeus, and the corruptions of
   youths by the other gods, and the voluptuous jealousies of the females,
   and the fears and acts of cowardice and other wickednesses, they merely
   convict themselves of narrating not merely about no gods, but not even
   about respectable men, but on the contrary, of telling tales about
   shameful persons far removed from what is honourable.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§16. Heathen arguments in palliation of the above: and (1) the poets
   are responsible for these unedifying tales.' But are the names and
   existence of the gods any better authenticated? Both stand or fall
   together. Either the actions must be defended or the deity of the gods
   given up. And the heroes are not credited with acts inconsistent with
   their nature, as, on this plea, the gods are.

   But perhaps, as to all this, the impious will appeal to the peculiar
   style of poets, saying that it is the peculiarity of poets to feign
   what is not, and, for the pleasure of their hearers, to tell fictitious
   tales; and that for this reason they have composed the stories about
   gods. But this pretext of theirs, even more than any other, will appear
   to be superficial from what they themselves think and profess about
   these matters. 2. For if what is said in the poets is fictitious and
   false, even the nomenclature of Zeus, Cronos, Hera, Ares and the rest
   must be false. For perhaps, as they say, even the names are fictitious,
   and, while no such being exists as Zeus, Cronos, or Ares, the poets
   feign their existence to deceive their hearers. But if the poets feign
   the existence of unreal beings, how is it that they worship them as
   though they existed? 3. Or perhaps, once again, they will say that
   while the names are not fictitious, they ascribe to them fictitious
   actions. But even this is equally precarious as a defence. For if they
   made up the actions, doubtless also they made up the names, to which
   they attributed the actions. Or if they tell the truth about the names,
   it follows that they tell the truth about the actions too. In
   particular, they who have said in their tales that these are gods
   certainly know how gods ought to act, and would never ascribe to gods
   the ideas of men, any more than one would ascribe to water the
   properties of fire; for fire burns, whereas the nature of water on the
   contrary is cold. 4. If then the actions are worthy of gods, they that
   do them must be gods; but if they are actions of men, and of
   disreputable men, such as adultery and the acts mentioned above, they
   that act in such ways must be men and not gods. For their deeds must
   correspond to their natures, so that at once the actor may be made
   known by his act, and the action may be ascertainable from his nature.
   So that just as a man discussing about water and fire, and declaring
   their action, would not say that water burned and fire cooled, nor, if
   a man were discoursing about the sun and the earth, would he say the
   earth gave light, while the sun was sown with herbs and fruits, but if
   he were to say so would exceed the utmost height of madness, so neither
   would their writers, and especially the most eminent poet of all, if
   they really knew that Zeus and the others were gods, invest them with
   such actions as shew them to be not gods, but rather men, and not sober
   men. 5. Or if, as poets, they told falsehoods, and you are maligning
   them, why did they not also tell falsehoods about the courage of the
   heroes, and feign feebleness in the place of courage, and courage in
   that of feebleness? For they ought in that case, as with Zeus and Hera,
   so also to slanderously accuse Achilles of want of courage, and to
   celebrate the might of Thersites, and, while charging Odysseus with
   dulness, to make out Nestor a reckless person, and to narrate
   effeminate actions of Diomed and Hector, and manly deeds of Hecuba. For
   the fiction and falsehood they ascribe to the poets ought to extend to
   all cases. But in fact, they kept the truth for their men, while not
   ashamed to tell falsehoods about their so-called gods. 6. And as some
   of them might argue, that they are telling falsehoods about their
   licentious actions, but that in their praises, when they speak of Zeus
   as father of gods, and as the highest, and the Olympian, and as
   reigning in heaven, they are not inventing but speaking truthfully;
   this is a plea which not only myself, but anybody can refute. For the
   truth will be clear, in opposition to them, if we recall our previous
   proofs. For while their actions prove them to be men, the panegyrics
   upon them go beyond the nature of men. The two things then are mutually
   inconsistent; for neither is it the nature of heavenly beings to act in
   such ways, nor can any one suppose that persons so acting are gods.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§17. The truth probably is, that the scandalous tales are true, while
   the divine attributes ascribed to them are due to the flattery of the
   poets.

   What inference then is left to us, save that while the panegyrics are
   false and flattering, the actions told of them are true? And the truth
   of this one can ascertain by common practice. For nobody who pronounces
   a panegyric upon anyone accuses his conduct at the same time, but
   rather, if men's actions are disgraceful, they praise them up with
   panegyrics, on account of the scandal they cause, so that by
   extravagant praise they may impose upon their hearers, and hide the
   misconduct of the others. 2. Just as if a man who has to pronounce a
   panegyric upon someone cannot find material for it in their conduct or
   in any personal qualities, on account of the scandal attaching to
   these, he praises them up in another manner, flattering them with what
   does not belong to them, so have their marvellous poets, put out of
   countenance by the scandalous actions of their so-called gods, attached
   to them the superhuman title, not knowing that they cannot by their
   superhuman fancies veil their human actions, but that they will rather
   succeed in shewing, by their human shortcomings, that the attributes of
   God do not fit them. 3. And I am disposed to think that they have
   recounted the passions and the actions of the gods even in spite of
   themselves. For since they were endeavouring to invest with what
   Scripture calls the incommunicable name and honour of [131] God them
   that are no gods but mortal men, and since this venture of theirs was
   great and impious, for this reason even against their will they were
   forced by truth to set forth the passions of these persons, so that
   their passions recorded in the writings concerning them might be in
   evidence for all posterity as a proof that they were no gods.

   Â§18. Heathen defence continued. (2) The gods are worshipped for having
   invented the Arts of Life.' But this is a human and natural, not a
   divine, achievement. And why, on this principle, are not all inventors
   deified?

   What defence, then, what proof that these are real gods, can they offer
   who hold this superstition? For, by what has been said just above, our
   argument has demonstrated them to be men, and not respectable men. But
   perhaps they will turn to another argument, and proudly appeal to the
   things useful to life discovered by them, saying that the reason why
   they regard them as gods is their having been of use to mankind. For
   Zeus is said to have possessed the plastic art, Poseidon that of the
   pilot, HephÃ¦stus the smith's, Athena that of weaving, Apollo that of
   music, Artemis that of hunting, Hera dressmaking, Demeter agriculture,
   and others other arts, as those who inform us about them have related.
   2. But men ought to ascribe them and such like arts not to the gods
   alone but to the common nature of mankind, for by observing nature
   [132] men discover the arts. For even common parlance calls art an
   imitation of nature. If then they have been skilled in the arts they
   pursued, that is no reason for thinking them gods, but rather for
   thinking them men; for the arts were not their creation, but in them
   they, like others, imitated nature. 3. For men having a natural
   capacity for knowledge according to the definition laid down [133]
   concerning them, there is nothing to surprise us if by human
   intelligence, and by looking of themselves at their own nature and
   coming to know it, they have hit upon the arts. Or if they say that the
   discovery of the arts entitles them to be proclaimed as gods, it is
   high time to proclaim as gods the discoverers of the other arts on the
   same grounds as the former were thought worthy of such a title. For the
   Phoenicians invented letters, Homer epic poetry, Zeno of Elea
   dialectic, Corax of Syracuse rhetoric, AristÃ¦us bee-keeping,
   Triptolemus the sowing of corn, Lycurgus of Sparta and Solon of Athens
   laws; while Palamedes discovered the arrangement of letters, and
   numbers, and measures and weights. And others imparted various other
   things useful for the life of mankind, according to the testimony of
   our historians. 4. If then the arts make gods, and because of them
   carved gods exist, it follows, on their shewing, that those who at a
   later date discovered the other arts must be gods. Or if they do not
   deem these worthy of divine honour, but recognise that they are men, it
   were but consistent not to give even the name of gods to Zeus, Hera,
   and the others, but to believe that they too have been human beings,
   and all the more so, inasmuch as they were not even respectable in
   their day; just as by the very fact of sculpturing their form in
   statues they shew that they are nothing else but men.

   Â§19. The inconsistency of image worship. Arguments in palliation. (1)
   The divine nature must be expressed in a visible sign. (2) The image a
   means of supernatural communications to men through angels.

   For what other form do they give them by sculpture but that of men and
   women and of creatures lower yet and of irrational nature, all manner
   of birds, beasts both tame and wild, and creeping things, whatsoever
   land and sea and the whole realm of the waters produce? For men having
   fallen into the unreasonableness of their passions and pleasures, and
   unable to see anything beyond pleasures and lusts of the flesh,
   inasmuch as they keep their mind in the midst of these irrational
   things, they imagined the divine principle to be in irrational things,
   and carved a number of gods to match the variety of their passions. 2.
   For there are with them images of beasts and creeping things and birds,
   as the interpreter of the divine and true religion says, "They became
   vain in their reasonings, and their senseless heart was darkened.
   Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the
   glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of
   corruptible man, and of birds and four-footed beasts and creeping
   things, wherefore God gave them up unto vile passions." For having
   previously infected their soul, as I said above, with the
   irrationalities of pleasures, they then came down to this making of
   gods; and, once fallen, thenceforward as though abandoned in their
   rejection of God, thus they wallow [134] in them, and portray God, the
   Father of the Word, in irrational shapes. 3. As to which those who pass
   for philosophers and men of knowledge [135] among the Greeks, while
   driven to admit that their visible gods are the forms and figures of
   men and of irrational objects, say in defence that they have such
   things to the end that by their means the deity may answer them and be
   made manifest; because otherwise they could not know the invisible God,
   save by such statues and rites. 4. While those [136] who profess to
   give still deeper and more philosophical reasons than these say, that
   the reason of idols being prepared and fashioned is for the invocation
   and manifestation of divine angels and powers, that appearing by these
   means they may teach men concerning the knowledge of God; and that they
   serve as letters for men, by referring to which they may learn to
   apprehend God, from the manifestation of the divine angels effected by
   their means. Such then is their mythology,--for far be it from us to
   call it a theology. But if one examine the argument with care, he will
   find that the opinion of these persons also, not less than that of
   those previously spoken of, is false.

   [134] Cf. Orat. iii. 16.

   [135] This may refer to Maximus of Tyre (Saussaye, Â§11), or to the lost
   treatise of the divine Iamblichus' Peri agalmaton, which was considered
   worth answering by Christian writers as late as the seventh century
   (Philoponus in Phot. Bibl. Cod. 215).

   [136] This is in effect the defence of the Scriptor de Mysteriis'
   (possibly Iamblichus, see Bernays 2 Abhandlungen' 1880, p. 37):
   material means of worship are a means of access directly to the lower
   (or quasi-material) gods, and so indirectly to the higher. Few men can
   reach the latter without the aid of their manifestation in the lower;

     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§20. But where does this supposed virtue of the image reside? in the
   material, or in the form, or in the maker's skill? Untenability of all
   these views.

   For one might reply to them, bringing the case before the tribunal of
   truth, How does God make answer or become known by such objects? Is it
   due to the matter of which they consist, or to the form which they
   possess? For if it be due to the matter, what need is there of the
   form, instead of God manifesting Himself through all matter without
   exception before these things were fashioned? And in vain have they
   built their temples to shut in a single stone, or stock, or piece of
   gold, when all the world is full of these substances. 2. But if the
   superadded form be the cause of the divine manifestation, what is the
   need of the material, gold and the rest, instead of God manifesting
   Himself by the actual natural animals of which the images are the
   figures? For the opinion held about God would on the same principle
   have been a nobler one, were He to manifest Himself by means of living
   animals, whether rational or irrational, instead of being looked for in
   things without life or motion. 3. Wherein they commit the most signal
   impiety against themselves. For while they abominate and turn from the
   real animals, beasts, birds, and creeping things, either because of
   their ferocity or because of their dirtiness, yet they carve their
   forms in stone, wood, or gold, and make them gods. But it would be
   better for them to worship the living things themselves, rather than to
   worship their figures in stone. 4. But perhaps neither is the case, nor
   is either the material or the form the cause of the divine presence,
   but it is only skilful art that summons the deity, inasmuch as it is an
   imitation of nature. But if the deity communicates with the inmates on
   account of the art, what need, once more, of the material, since the
   art resides in the men? For if God manifests Himself solely because of
   the art, and if for this reason the images are worshipped as gods, it
   would be right to worship and serve the men who are masters of the art,
   inasmuch as they are rational also, and have the skill in themselves.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§21. The idea of communications through angels involves yet wilder
   inconsistency, nor does it, even if true, justify the worship of the
   image.

   But as to their second and as they say profounder defence, one might
   reasonably add as follows. If these things are made by you, ye Greeks,
   not for the sake of a self-manifestation of God Himself, but for the
   sake of a presence there of angels, why do you rank the images by which
   ye invoke the powers as superior and above the powers invoked? For ye
   carve the figures for the sake of the apprehension of God, as ye say,
   but invest the actual images with the honour and title of God, thus
   placing yourselves in a profane position. 2. For while confessing that
   the power of God transcends the littleness of the images, and for that
   reason not venturing to invoke God through them, but only the lesser
   powers, ye yourselves leap over these latter, and have bestowed on
   stocks and stones the title of Him, whose presence ye feared, and call
   them gods instead of stones and men's workmanship, and worship them.
   For even supposing them to serve you, as ye falsely say, as letters for
   the contemplation of God, it is not right to give the signs greater
   honour than that which they signify. For neither if a man were to write
   the emperor's name would it be without risk to give to the writing more
   honour than to the emperor; on the contrary, such a man incurs the
   penalty of death; while the writing is fashioned by the skill of the
   writer. 3. So also yourselves, had ye your reasoning power in full
   strength, would not reduce to matter so great a revelation of the
   Godhead: but neither would ye have given to the image greater honour
   than to the man that carved it. For if there be any truth in the plea
   that, as letters, they indicate the manifestation of God, and are
   therefore, as indications of God, worthy to be deified, yet far more
   would it be right to deify the artist who carved and engraved them, as
   being far more powerful and divine than they, inasmuch as they were cut
   and fashioned according to his will. If then the letters are worthy of
   admiration, much more does the writer exceed them in wonder, by reason
   of his art and the skill of his mind. If then it be not fitting to
   think that they are gods for this reason, one must again interrogate
   them about the madness concerning the idols, demanding from them the
   justification for their being in such a form.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§22. The image cannot represent the true form of God, else God would be
   corruptible.

   For if the reason of their being thus fashioned is, that the Deity is
   of human form, why do they invest it also with the forms of irrational
   creatures? Or if the form of it is that of the latter, why do they
   embody it also in the images of rational creatures? Or if it be both at
   once, and they conceive God to be of the two combined, namely, that He
   has the forms both of rational and of irrational, why do they separate
   what is joined together, and separate the images of brutes and of men,
   instead of always carving it of both kinds, such as are the fictions in
   the myths, Scylla, Charybdis, the Hippocentaur, and the dog-headed
   Anubis of the Egyptians? For they ought either to represent them solely
   of two natures in this way, or, if they have a single form, not to
   falsely represent them in the other as well. 2. And again, if their
   forms are male, why do they also invest them with female shapes? Or if
   they are of the latter, why do they also falsify their forms as though
   they were males? Or if again they are a mixture of both, they ought not
   to be divided, but both ought to be combined, and follow the type of
   the so-called hermaphrodites, so that their superstition should furnish
   beholders with a spectacle not only of impiety and calumny, but of
   ridicule as well. 2. And generally, if they conceive the Deity to be
   corporeal, so that they contrive for it and represent belly and hands
   and feet, and neck also, and breasts and the other organs that go to
   make man, see to what impiety and godlessness their mind has come down,
   to have such ideas of the Deity. For it follows that it must be capable
   of all other bodily casualties as well, of being cut and divided, and
   even of perishing altogether. But these and like things are not
   properties of God, but rather of earthly bodies. 3. For while God is
   incorporeal and incorruptible, and immortal, needing nothing for any
   purpose, these are both corruptible, and are shapes of bodies, and need
   bodily ministrations, as we said before [137] . For often we see images
   which have grown old renewed, and those which time, or rain, or some or
   other of the animals of the earth have spoiled, restored. In which
   connexion one must condemn their folly, in that they proclaim as gods
   things of which they themselves are the makers, and themselves ask
   salvation of objects which they themselves adorn with their arts to
   preserve them from corruption, and beg that their own wants may be
   supplied by beings which they well know need attention from themselves,
   and are not ashamed to call lords of heaven and all the earth creatures
   whom they shut up in small chambers.

   Â§23. The variety of idolatrous cults proves that they are false.

   But not only from these considerations may one appreciate their
   godlessness, but also from their discordant opinions about the idols
   themselves. For if they be gods according to their assertion and their
   speculations, to which of them is one to give allegiance, and which of
   them is one to judge to be the higher, so as either to worship God with
   confidence, or as they say to recognise the Deity by them without
   ambiguity? For not the same beings are called gods among all; on the
   contrary, for every nation almost there is a separate god imagined. And
   there are cases of a single district and a single town being at
   internal discord about the superstition of their idols. 2. The
   Phoenicians, for example, do not know those who are called gods among
   the Egyptians, nor do the Egyptians worship the same idols as the
   Phoenicians have. And while the Scythians reject the gods of the
   Persians, the Persians reject those of the Syrians. But the Pelasgians
   also repudiate the gods in Thrace, while the Thracians know not those
   of Thebes. The Indians moreover differ from the Arabs, the Arabs from
   the Ethiopians, and the Ethiopians from the Arabs in their idols. And
   the Syrians worship not the idols of the Cilicians, while the
   Cappadocian nation call gods beings different from these. And while the
   Bithynians have adopted others, the Armenians have imagined others
   again. And what need is there for me to multiply examples? The men on
   the continent worship other gods than the islanders, while these latter
   serve other gods than those of the main lands. 3. And, in general,
   every city and village, not knowing the gods of its neighbours, prefers
   its own, and deems that these alone are gods. For concerning the
   abominations in Egypt there is no need even to speak, as they are
   before the eyes of all: how the cities have religions which are
   opposite and incompatible, and neighbours always make a point of
   worshipping the opposite of those next to them [138] : so much so that
   the crocodile, prayed to by some, is held in abomination by their
   neighbours, while the lion, worshipped as a god by others, their
   neighbours, so far from worshipping, slay, if they find it, as a wild
   beast; and the fish, consecrated by some people, is used as food in
   another place. And thus arise fights and riots and frequent occasions
   of bloodshed, and every indulgence of the passions among them. 4. And
   strange to say, according to the statement of historians, the very
   Pelasgians, who learned from the Egyptians the names of the gods, do
   not know the gods of Egypt, but worship others instead. And, speaking
   generally, all the nations that are infatuated with idols have
   different opinions and religions, and consistency is not to be met with
   in any one case. Nor is this surprising. 5. For having fallen from the
   contemplation of the one God, they have come down to many and diverse
   objects; and having turned from the Word of the Father, Christ the
   Saviour of all, they naturally have their understanding wandering in
   many directions. And just as men who have turned from the sun and are
   come into dark places go round by many pathless ways, and see not those
   who are present, while they imagine those to be there who are not, and
   seeing see not; so they that have turned from God and whose soul is
   darkened, have their mind in a roving state, and like men who are drunk
   and cannot see, imagine what is not true.

   modern science (toute Francaise') of Egyptology has enabled us to read
   behind the grotesque features of popular Egyptian polytheism.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§24. The so-called gods of one place are used as victims in another.

   This, then, is no slight proof of their real godlessness. For, the gods
   for every city and country being many and various, and the one
   destroying the god of the other, the whole of them are destroyed by
   all. For those who are considered gods by some are offered as
   sacrifices and drink-offerings to the so-called gods of others, and the
   victims of some are conversely the gods of others. So the Egyptians
   serve the ox, and Apis, a calf, and others sacrifice these animals to
   Zeus. For even if they do not sacrifice the very animals the others
   have consecrated, yet by sacrificing their fellows they seem to offer
   the same. The Libyans have for god a sheep which they call Ammon, and
   in other nations this animal is slain as a victim to many gods. 2. The
   Indians worship Dionysus, using the name as a symbol for wine, and
   others pour out wine as an offering to the other gods. Others honour
   rivers and springs, and above all the Egyptians pay especial honour to
   water, calling them gods. And yet others, and even the Egyptians who
   worship the waters, use them to wash off the dirt from others and from
   themselves, and ignominiously throw away what is used. While nearly the
   whole of the Egyptian system of idols consists of what are victims to
   the gods of other nations, so that they are scorned even by those
   others for deifying what are not gods, but, both with others and even
   among themselves, propitiatory offerings and victims.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§25. Human sacrifice. Its absurdity. Its prevalence. Its calamitous
   results.

   But some have been led by this time to such a pitch of irreligion and
   folly as to slay and to offer in sacrifice to their false gods even
   actual men, whose figures and forms the gods are. Nor do they see,
   wretched men, that the victims they are slaying are the patterns of the
   gods they make and worship, and to whom they are offering the men. For
   they are offering, one may say, equals to equals, or rather, the higher
   to the lower; for they are offering living creatures to dead, and
   rational beings to things without motion. 2. For the Scythians who are
   called Taurians offer in sacrifice to their Virgin, as they call her,
   survivors from wrecks, and such Greeks as they catch, going thus far in
   impiety against men of their own race, and thus exposing the savagery
   of their gods, in that those whom Providence has rescued from danger
   and from the sea, they slay, almost fighting against Providence;
   because they frustrate the kindness of Providence by their own brutal
   character. But others, when they are returned victorious from war,
   thereupon dividing their prisoners into hundreds, and taking a man from
   each, sacrifice to Ares the man they have picked out from each hundred.
   3. Nor is it only Scythians who commit these abominations on account of
   the ferocity natural to them as barbarians: on the contrary, this deed
   is a special result of the wickedness connected with idols and false
   gods. For the Egyptians used formerly to offer victims of this kind to
   Hera, and the Phoenicians and Cretans used to propitiate Cronos in
   their sacrifices of children. And even the ancient Romans used to
   worship Jupiter Latiarius, as he was called, with human sacrifices, and
   some in one way, some in another, but all [139] without exception
   committed and incurred the pollution: they incurred it by the mere
   perpetration of the murderous deeds, while they polluted their own
   temples by filling them with the smoke of such sacrifices. 4. This then
   was the ready source of numerous evils to mankind. For seeing that
   their false gods were pleased with these things, they forthwith
   imitated their gods with like misdoings, thinking that the imitation of
   superior beings, as they considered them, was a credit to themselves.
   Hence mankind was thinned by murders of grown men and children, and by
   licence of all kinds. For nearly every city is full of licentiousness
   of all kinds, the result of the savage character of its gods; nor is
   there one of sober life in the idols' temples [140] save only he whose
   licentiousness is witnessed to by them all [141] .

   [141] i.e. among the licentious worshippers the lifeless image is the
   only one free from vice, although the worshippers credit him with
   divine attributes, and therefore, according to their superstition, with
   a licentious life.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§26. The moral corruptions of Paganism all admittedly originated with
   the gods.

   Women, for example, used to sit out in old days in the temples of
   Phoenicia, consecrating to the gods there the hire of their bodies,
   thinking they propitiated their goddess by fornication, and that they
   would procure her favour by this. While men, denying their nature, and
   no longer wishing to be males, put on the guise of women, under the
   idea that they are thus gratifying and honouring the Mother of their
   so-called gods. But all live along with the basest, and vie with the
   worst among themselves, and as Paul said, the holy minister of Christ
   [142] : "For their women changed the natural use into that which is
   against nature: and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of
   the woman, burned in their lust one toward another, men with men
   working unseemliness." 2. But acting in this and in like ways, they
   admit and prove that the life of their so-called gods was of the same
   kind. For from Zeus they have learned corruption of youth and adultery,
   from Aphrodite fornication, from Rhea licentiousness, from Ares
   murders, and from other gods other like things, which the laws punish
   and from which every sober man turns away. Does it then remain fit to
   consider them gods who do such things, instead of reckoning them, for
   the licentiousness of their ways, more irrational than the brutes? Is
   it fit to consider their worshippers human beings, instead of pitying
   them as more irrational than the brutes, and more soul-less than
   inanimate things? For had they considered the intellectual part of
   their soul they would not have plunged headlong into these things, nor
   have denied the true God, the Father of Christ.

   Â§27. The refutation of popular Paganism being taken as conclusive, we
   come to the higher form of nature-worship. How Nature witnesses to God
   by the mutual dependence of all her parts, which forbid us to think of
   any one of them as the supreme God. This shewn at length.

   But perhaps those who have advanced beyond these things, and who stand
   in awe of Creation, being put to shame by these exposures of
   abominations, will join in repudiating what is readily condemned and
   refuted on all hands, but will think that they have a well-grounded and
   unanswerable opinion, namely, the worship of the universe and of the
   parts of the universe. 2. For they will boast that they worship and
   serve, not mere stocks and stones and forms of men and irrational birds
   and creeping things and beasts, but the sun and moon and all the
   heavenly universe, and the earth again, and the entire realm of water:
   and they will say that none can shew that these at any rate are not of
   divine nature, since it is evident to all, that they lack neither life
   nor reason, but transcend even the nature of mankind, inasmuch as the
   one inhabit the heavens, the other the earth. 3. It is worth while then
   to look into and examine these points also; for here, too, our argument
   will find that its proof against them holds true. But before we look,
   or begin our demonstration, it suffices that Creation almost raises its
   voice against them, and points to God as its Maker and Artificer, Who
   reigns over Creation and over all things, even the Father of our Lord
   Jesus Christ; Whom the would-be philosophers turn from to worship and
   deify the Creation which proceeded from Him, which yet itself worships
   and confesses the Lord Whom they deny on its account. 4. For if men are
   thus awestruck at the parts of Creation and think that they are gods,
   they might well be rebuked by the mutual dependence of those parts;
   which moreover makes known, and witnesses to, the Father of the Word,
   Who is the Lord and Maker of these parts also, by the unbroken law of
   their obedience to Him, as the divine law also says: "The heavens
   declare the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth His handiwork [143]
   ." 5. But the proof of all this is not obscure, but is clear enough in
   all conscience to those the eyes of whose understanding are not wholly
   disabled. For if a man take the parts of Creation separately, and
   consider each by itself,--as for example the sun by itself alone, and
   the moon apart, and again earth and air, and heat and cold, and the
   essence of wet and of dry, separating them from their mutual
   conjunction,--he will certainly find that not one is sufficient for
   itself but all are in need of one another's assistance, and subsist by
   their mutual help. For the Sun is carried round along with, and is
   contained in, the whole heaven, and can never go beyond his own orbit,
   while the moon and other stars testify to the assistance given them by
   the Sun: while the earth again evidently does not yield her crops
   without rains, which in their turn would not descend to earth without
   the assistance of the clouds; but not even would the clouds ever appear
   of themselves and subsist, without the air. And the air is warmed by
   the upper air, but illuminated and made bright by the sun, not by
   itself. 6. And wells, again, and rivers will never exist without the
   earth; but the earth is not supported upon itself, but is set upon the
   realm of the waters, while this again is kept in its place, being bound
   fast at the centre of the universe. And the sea, and the great ocean
   that flows outside round the whole earth, is moved and borne by winds
   wherever the force of the winds dashes it. And the winds in their turn
   originate, not in themselves, but according to those who have written
   on the subject, in the air, from the burning heat and high temperature
   of the upper as compared with the lower air, and blow everywhere
   through the latter. 7. For as to the four elements of which the nature
   of bodies is composed, heat, that is, and cold, wet and dry, who is so
   perverted in his understanding as not to know that these things exist
   indeed in combination, but if separated and taken alone they tend to
   destroy even one another according to the prevailing power of the more
   abundant element? For heat is destroyed by cold if it be present in
   greater quantity, and cold again is put away by the power of heat, and
   what is dry, again, is moistened by wet, and the latter dried by the
   former.

   Â§28. But neither can the cosmic organism be God. For that would make
   God consist of dissimilar parts, and subject Him to possible
   dissolution.

   How then can these things be gods, seeing that they need one another's
   assistance? Or how is it proper to ask anything of them when they too
   ask help for themselves one from another? For if it is an admitted
   truth about God that He stands in need of nothing, but is
   self-sufficient and self-contained, and that in Him all things have
   their being, and that He ministers to all rather than they to Him, how
   is it right to proclaim as gods the sun and moon and other parts of
   creation, which are of no such kind, but which even stand in need of
   one another's help? 2. But, perhaps, if divided and taken by
   themselves, our opponents themselves will admit that they are
   dependent, the demonstration being an ocular one. But they will combine
   all together, as constituting a single body, and will say that the
   whole is God. For the whole once put together, they will no longer need
   external help, but the whole will be sufficient for itself and
   independent in all respects; so at least the would-be philosophers will
   tell us, only to be refuted here once more. 3. Now this argument, not
   one whit less than those previously dealt with, will demonstrate their
   impiety coupled with great ignorance. For if the combination of the
   parts makes up the whole, and the whole is combined out of the parts,
   then the whole consists of the parts, and each of them is a portion of
   the whole. But this is very far removed from the conception of God. For
   God is a whole and not a number of parts, and does not consist of
   diverse elements, but is Himself the Maker of the system of the
   universe. For see what impiety they utter against the Deity when they
   say this. For if He consists of parts, certainly it will follow that He
   is unlike Himself, and made up of unlike parts. For if He is sun, He is
   not moon, and if He is moon, He is not earth, and if He is earth, He
   cannot be sea: and so on, taking the parts one by one, one may discover
   the absurdity of this theory of theirs. 4. But the following point,
   drawn from the observation of our human body, is enough to refute them.
   For just as the eye is not the sense of hearing, nor is the latter a
   hand: nor is the belly the breast, nor again is the neck a foot, but
   each of these has its own function, and a single body is composed of
   these distinct parts,--having its parts combined for use, but destined
   to be divided in course of time when nature, that brought them
   together, shall divide them at the will of God, Who so ordered
   it;--thus (but may He that is above pardon the argument [144] ), if
   they combine the parts of creation into one body and proclaim it God,
   it follows, firstly, that He is unlike Himself, as shewn above;
   secondly, that He is destined to be divided again, in accordance with
   the natural tendency of the parts to separation.

   Â§29. The balance of powers in Nature shews that it is not God, either
   collectively, or in parts.

   And in yet another way one may refute their godlessness by the light of
   truth. For if God is incorporeal and invisible and intangible by
   nature, how do they imagine God to be a body, and worship with divine
   honour things which we both see with our eyes and touch with our hands?
   2. And again, if what is said of God hold true, namely, that He is
   almighty, and that while nothing has power over Him, He has power and
   rule over all, how can they who deify creation fail to see that it does
   not satisfy this definition of God? For when the sun is under the
   earth, the earth's shadow makes his light invisible, while by day the
   sun hides the moon by the brilliancy of his light. And hail ofttimes
   injures the fruits of the earth, while fire is put out if an overflow
   of water take place. And spring makes winter give place, while summer
   will not suffer spring to outstay its proper limits, and it in its turn
   is forbidden by autumn to outstep its own season. 3. If then they were
   gods, they ought not to be defeated and obscured by one another, but
   always to co-exist, and to discharge their respective functions
   simultaneously. Both by night and by day the sun and the moon and the
   rest of the band of stars ought to shine equally together, and give
   their light to all, so that all things might be illumined by them.
   Spring and summer and autumn and winter ought to go on without
   alteration, and together. The sea ought to mingle with the springs, and
   furnish their drink to man in common. Calms and windy blasts ought to
   take place at the same time. Fire and water together ought to furnish
   the same service to man. For no one would take any hurt from them, if
   they are gods, as our opponents say, and do nothing for hurt, but
   rather all things for good. 4. But if none of these things are
   possible, because of their mutual incompatibility, how does it remain
   possible to give to these things, mutually incompatible and at strife,
   and unable to combine, the name of gods, or to worship them with the
   honours due to God? How could things naturally discordant give peace to
   others for their prayers, and become to them authors of concord? It is
   not then likely that the sun or the moon, or any other part of
   creation, still less statues in stone, gold, or other material, or the
   Zeus, Apollo, and the rest, who are the subject of the poet's fables,
   are true gods: this our argument has shewn. But some of these are parts
   of creation, others have no life, others have been mere mortal men.
   Therefore their worship and deification is no part of religion, but the
   bringing in of godlessness and of all impiety, and a sign of a wide
   departure from the knowledge of the one true God, namely the Father of
   Christ. 5. Since then this is thus proved, and the idolatry of the
   Greeks is shewn to be full of all ungodliness, and that its
   introduction has been not for the good, but for the ruin, of human
   life;--come now, as our argument promised at the outset, let us, after
   having confuted error, travel the way of truth, and behold the Leader
   and Artificer of the Universe, the Word of the Father, in order that
   through Him we may apprehend the Father, and that the Greeks may know
   how far they have separated themselves from the truth.

   Part II.

   Â§30. The soul of man, being intellectual, can know God of itself, if it
   be true to its own nature.

   The tenets we have been speaking of have been proved to be nothing more
   than a false guide for life; but the way of truth will aim at reaching
   the real and true God. But for its knowledge and accurate
   comprehension, there is need of none other save of ourselves. Neither
   as God Himself is above all, is the road to Him afar off or outside
   ourselves, but it is in us and it is possible to find it from
   ourselves, in the first instance, as Moses also taught, when he said
   [145] : "The word" of faith "is within thy heart." Which very thing the
   Saviour declared and confirmed, when He said: "The kingdom of God is
   within you [146] ." 2. For having in ourselves faith, and the kingdom
   of God, we shall be able quickly to see and perceive the King of the
   Universe, the saving Word of the Father. And let not the Greeks, who
   worship idols, make excuses, nor let any one else simply deceive
   himself, professing to have no such road and therefore finding a
   pretext for his godlessness. 3. For we all have set foot upon it, and
   have it, even if not all are willing to travel by it, but rather to
   swerve from it and go wrong, because of the pleasures of life which
   attract them from without. And if one were to ask, what road is this? I
   say that it is the soul of each one of us, and the intelligence which
   resides there. For by it alone can God be contemplated and perceived.
   4. Unless, as they have denied God, the impious men will repudiate
   having a soul; which indeed is more plausible than the rest of what
   they say, for it is unlike men possessed of an intellect to deny God,
   its Maker and Artificer. It is necessary then, for the sake of the
   simple, to shew briefly that each one of mankind has a soul, and that
   soul rational; especially as certain of the sectaries deny this also,
   thinking that man is nothing more than the visible form of the body.
   This point once proved, they will be furnished in their own persons
   with a clearer proof against the idols.

   Â§31. Proof of the existence of the rational soul. (1) Difference of man
   from the brutes. (2) Man's power of objective thought. Thought is to
   sense as the musician to his instrument. The phenomena of dreams bear
   this out.

   Firstly, then, the rational nature of the soul is strongly confirmed by
   its difference from irrational creatures. For this is why common use
   gives them that name, because, namely, the race of mankind is rational.
   2. Secondly, it is no ordinary proof, that man alone thinks of things
   external to himself, and reasons about things not actually present, and
   exercises reflection, and chooses by judgment the better of alternative
   reasonings. For the irrational animals see only what is present, and
   are impelled solely by what meets their eye, even if the consequences
   to them are injurious, while man is not impelled toward what he sees
   merely, but judges by thought what he sees with his eyes. Often for
   example his impulses are mastered by reasoning; and his reasoning is
   subject to after-reflection. And every one, if he be a friend of truth,
   perceives that the intelligence of mankind is distinct from the bodily
   senses. 3. Hence, because it is distinct, it acts as judge of the
   senses, and while they apprehend their objects, the intelligence
   distinguishes, recollects, and shews them what is best. For the sole
   function of the eye is to see, of the ears to hear, of the mouth to
   taste, of the nostrils to apprehend smells, and of the hands to touch.
   But what one ought to see and hear, what one ought to touch, taste and
   smell, is a question beyond the senses, and belonging to the soul and
   to the intelligence which resides in it. Why, the hand is able to take
   hold of a sword-blade, and the mouth to taste poison, but neither knows
   that these are injurious, unless the intellect decide. 4. And the case,
   to look at it by aid of a simile, is like that of a well-fashioned lyre
   in the hands of a skilled musician. For as the strings of the lyre have
   each its proper note, high, low, or intermediate, sharp or otherwise,
   yet their scale is indistinguishable and their time not to be
   recognized, without the artist. For then only is the scale manifest and
   the time right, when he that is holding the lyre strikes the strings
   and touches each in tune. In like manner, the senses being disposed in
   the body like a lyre, when the skilled intelligence presides over them,
   then too the soul distinguishes and knows what it is doing and how it
   is acting. 5. But this alone is peculiar to mankind, and this is what
   is rational in the soul of mankind, by means of which it differs from
   the brutes, and shews that it is truly distinct from what is to be seen
   in the body. Often, for example, when the body is lying on the earth,
   man imagines and contemplates what is in the heavens. Often when the
   body is quiet [147] , and at rest and asleep, man moves inwardly, and
   beholds what is outside himself, travelling to other countries, walking
   about, meeting his acquaintances, and often by these means divining and
   forecasting the actions of the day. But to what can this be due save to
   the rational soul, in which man thinks of and perceives things beyond
   himself?

   Â§32. (3) The body cannot originate such phenomena; and in fact the
   action of the rational soul is seen in its over-ruling the instincts of
   the bodily organs.

   We add a further point to complete our demonstration for the benefit of
   those [148] who shamelessly take refuge in denial of reason. How is it,
   that whereas the body is mortal by nature, man reasons on the things of
   immortality, and often, where virtue demands it, courts death? Or how,
   since the body lasts but for a time, does man imagine of things
   eternal, so as to despise what lies before him, and desire what is
   beyond? The body could not have spontaneously such thoughts about
   itself, nor could it think upon what is external to itself. For it is
   mortal and lasts but for a time. And it follows that that which thinks
   what is opposed to the body and against its nature must be distinct in
   kind. What then can this be, save a rational and immortal soul? For it
   introduces the echo of higher things, not outside, but within the body,
   as the musician does in his lyre. 2. Or how again, the eye being
   naturally constituted to see and the ear to hear, do they turn from
   some objects and choose others? For who is it that turns away the eye
   from seeing? Or who shuts off the ear from hearing, its natural
   function? Or who often hinders the palate, to which it is natural to
   taste things, from its natural impulse? Or who withholds the hand from
   its natural activity of touching something, or turns aside the sense of
   smell from its normal exercise [149] ? Who is it that thus acts against
   the natural instincts of the body? Or how does the body, turned from
   its natural course, turn to the counsels of another and suffer itself
   to be guided at the beck of that other? Why, these things prove simply
   this, that the rational soul presides over the body. 3. For the body is
   not even constituted to drive itself, but it is carried at the will of
   another, just as a horse does not yoke himself, but is driven by his
   master. Hence laws for human beings to practise what is good and to
   abstain from evil-doing, while to the brutes evil remains unthought of
   and undiscerned, because they lie outside rationality and the process
   of understanding. I think then that the existence of a rational soul in
   man is proved by what we have said.

   Â§33. The soul immortal. Proved by (1) its being distinct from the body,
   (2) its being the source of motion, (3) its power to go beyond the body
   in imagination and thought.

   But that the soul is made immortal is a further point in the Church's
   teaching which you must know, to show how the idols are to be
   overthrown. But we shall more directly arrive at a knowledge of this
   from what we know of the body, and from the difference between the body
   and the soul. For if our argument has proved it to be distinct from the
   body, while the body is by nature mortal, it follows that the soul is
   immortal, because it is not like the body. 2. And again, if as we have
   shewn, the soul moves the body and is not moved by other things, it
   follows that the movement of the soul is spontaneous, and that this
   spontaneous movement goes on after the body is laid aside in the earth.
   If then the soul were moved by the body, it would follow that the
   severance of its motor would involve its death. But if the soul moves
   the body also, it follows all the more that it moves itself. But if
   moved by itself [150] , it follows that it outlives the body. 3. For
   the movement of the soul is the same thing as its life, just as, of
   course, we call the body alive when it moves, and say that its death
   takes place when it ceases moving. But this can be made clearer once
   for all from the action of the soul in the body. For if even when
   united and coupled with the body it is not shut in or commensurate with
   the small dimensions of the body, but often [151] , when the body lies
   in bed, not moving, but in death-like sleep, the soul keeps awake by
   virtue of its own power, and transcends the natural power of the body,
   and as though travelling away from the body while remaining in it,
   imagines and beholds things above the earth, and often even holds
   converse with the saints and angels who are above earthly and bodily
   existence, and approaches them in the confidence of the purity of its
   intelligence; shall it not all the more, when separated from the body
   at the time appointed by God Who coupled them together, have its
   knowledge of immortality more clear? For if even when coupled with the
   body it lived a life outside the body, much more shall its life
   continue after the death of the body, and live without ceasing by
   reason of God Who made it thus by His own Word, our Lord Jesus Christ.
   4. For this is the reason why the soul thinks of and bears in mind
   things immortal and eternal, namely, because it is itself immortal. And
   just as, the body being mortal, its senses also have mortal things as
   their objects, so, since the soul contemplates and beholds immortal
   things, it follows that it is immortal and lives for ever. For ideas
   and thoughts about immortality never desert the soul, but abide in it,
   and are as it were the fuel in it which ensures its immortality. This
   then is why the soul has the capacity for beholding God, and is its own
   way thereto, receiving not from without but from herself the knowledge
   and apprehension of the Word of God.

   [150] Cf. Plato PhÃ¦dr. 245 C-E., Legg. 896, A, B. The former passage is
   more likely to be referred to here as it is, like the text, an argument
   for immortality. Athan. has also referred to PhÃ¦drus above, Â§5.

   Â§34. The soul, then, if only it get rid of the stains of sin is able to
   know God directly, its own rational nature imaging back the Word of
   God, after whose image it was created. But even if it cannot pierce the
   cloud which sin draws over its vision, it is confronted by the witness
   of creation to God.

   We repeat then what we said before, that just as men denied God, and
   worship things without soul, so also in thinking they have not a
   rational soul, they receive at once the punishment of their folly,
   namely, to be reckoned among irrational creatures: and so, since as
   though from lack of a soul of their own they superstitiously worship
   soulless gods, they are worthy of pity and guidance. 2. But if they
   claim to have a soul, and pride themselves on the rational principle,
   and that rightly, why do they, as though they had no soul, venture to
   go against reason, and think not as they ought, but make themselves out
   higher even than the Deity? For having a soul that is immortal and
   invisible to them, they make a likeness of God in things visible and
   mortal. Or why, in like manner as they have departed from God, do they
   not betake themselves to Him again? For they are able, as they turned
   away their understanding from God, and feigned as gods things that were
   not, in like manner to ascend with the intelligence of their soul, and
   turn back to God again. 3. But turn back they can, if they lay aside
   the filth of all lust which they have put on, and wash it away
   persistently, until they have got rid of all the foreign matter that
   has affected their soul, and can shew it in its simplicity as it was
   made, that so they may be able by it to behold the Word of the Father
   after Whose likeness they were originally made. For the soul is made
   after the image and likeness of God, as divine Scripture also shews,
   when it says in the person of God [152] : "Let us make man after our
   Image and likeness." Whence also when it gets rid of all the filth of
   sin which covers it and retains only the likeness of the Image in its
   purity, then surely this latter being thoroughly brightened, the soul
   beholds as in a mirror the Image of the Father, even the Word, and by
   His means reaches the idea of the Father, Whose Image the Saviour is.
   4. Or, if the soul's own teaching is insufficient, by reason of the
   external things which cloud its intelligence, and prevent its seeing
   what is higher, yet it is further possible to attain to the knowledge
   of God from the things which are seen, since Creation, as though in
   written characters, declares in a loud voice, by its order and harmony,
   its own Lord and Creator.

   Part III.

   Â§35. Creation a revelation of God; especially in the order and harmony
   pervading the whole.

   For God, being good and loving to mankind, and caring for the souls
   made by Him,--since He is by nature invisible and incomprehensible,
   having His being beyond all created existence [153] , for which reason
   the race of mankind was likely to miss the way to the knowledge of Him,
   since they are made out of nothing while He is unmade,--for this cause
   God by His own Word gave the Universe the Order it has, in order that
   since He is by nature invisible, men might be enabled to know Him at
   any rate by His works [154] . For often the artist even when not seen
   is known by his works. 2. And as they tell of Phidias the Sculptor that
   his works of art by their symmetry and by the proportion of their parts
   betray Phidias to those who see them although he is not there, so by
   the order of the Universe one ought to perceive God its maker and
   artificer, even though He be not seen with the bodily eyes. For God did
   not take His stand upon His invisible nature (let none plead that as an
   excuse) and leave Himself utterly unknown to men; but as I said above,
   He so ordered Creation that although He is by nature invisible He may
   yet be known by His works. 3. And I say this not on my own authority,
   but on the strength of what I learned from men who have spoken of God,
   among them Paul, who thus writes to the Romans [155] : "for the
   invisible things of Him since the creation of the world are clearly
   seen, being understood by the things that are made;" while to the
   Lycaonians he speaks out and says [156] : "We also are men of like
   passions with you, and bring you good tidings, to turn from these vain
   things unto a Living God, Who made the heaven and the earth and the
   sea, and all that in them is, Who in the generations gone by suffered
   all nations to walk in their own ways. And yet He left not Himself
   without witness, in that He did good, and gave you [157] from heaven
   rains and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and
   gladness." 4. For who that sees the circle of heaven and the course of
   the sun and the moon, and the positions and movements of the other
   stars, as they take place in opposite and different directions, while
   yet in their difference all with one accord observe a consistent order,
   can resist the conclusion that these are not ordered by themselves, but
   have a maker distinct from themselves who orders them? or who that sees
   the sun rising by day and the moon shining by night, and waning and
   waxing without variation exactly according to the same number of days,
   and some of the stars running their courses and with orbits various and
   manifold, while others move [158] without wandering, can fail to
   perceive that they certainly have a creator to guide them?

     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§36. This the more striking, if we consider the opposing forces out of
   which this order is produced.

   Who that sees things of opposite nature combined, and in concordant
   harmony, as for example fire mingled with cold, and dry with wet, and
   that not in mutual conflict, but making up a single body, as it were
   homogeneous, can resist the inference that there is One external to
   these things that has united them? Who that sees winter giving place to
   spring and spring to summer and summer to autumn, and that these things
   contrary by nature (for the one chills, the other burns, the one
   nourishes, the other destroys), yet all make up a balanced result
   beneficial to mankind,--can fail to perceive that there is One higher
   than they, Who balances and guides them all, even if he see Him not? 2.
   Who that sees the clouds supported in air, and the weight of the waters
   bound up in the clouds, can but perceive Him that binds them up and has
   ordered these things so? Or who that sees the earth, heaviest of all
   things by nature, fixed upon the waters, and remaining unmoved upon
   what is by nature mobile, will fail to understand that there is One
   that has made and ordered it, even God? Who that sees the earth
   bringing forth fruits in due season, and the rains from heaven, and the
   flow of rivers, and springing up of wells, and the birth of animals
   from unlike parents, and that these things take place not at all times
   but at determinate seasons,--and in general, among things mutually
   unlike and contrary, the balanced and uniform order to which they
   conform,--can resist the inference that there is one Power which orders
   and administers them, ordaining things well as it thinks fit? 4. For
   left to themselves they could not subsist or ever be able to appear, on
   account of their mutual contrariety of nature. For water is by nature
   heavy, and tends to flow downwards, while the clouds are light and
   belong to the class of things which tend to soar and mount upwards. And
   yet we see water, heavy as it is, borne aloft in the clouds. And again,
   earth is very heavy, while water on the other hand is relatively light;
   and yet the heavier is supported upon the lighter, and the earth does
   not sink, but remains immoveable. And male and female are not the same,
   while yet they unite in one, and the result is the generation from both
   of an animal like them. And to cut the matter short, cold is opposite
   to heat, and wet fights with dry, and yet they come together and are
   not at variance, but they agree, and produce as their result a single
   body, and the birth of everything.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§37. The same subject continued.

   Things then of conflicting and opposite nature would not have
   reconciled themselves, were there not One higher and Lord over them to
   unite them, to Whom the elements themselves yield obedience as slaves
   that obey a master. And instead of each having regard to its own nature
   and fighting with its neighbour, they recognise the Lord Who has united
   them, and are at concord one with another, being by nature opposed, but
   at amity by the will of Him that guides them. 2. For if their mingling
   into one were not due to a higher authority, how could the heavy mingle
   and combine with the light, the wet with the dry, the round with the
   straight, fire with cold, or sea with earth, or the sun with the moon,
   or the stars with the heaven, and the air with the clouds, the nature
   of each being dissimilar to that of the other? For there would be great
   strife among them, the one burning, the other giving cold; the heavy
   dragging downwards, the light in the contrary direction and upwards;
   the sun giving light while the air diffused darkness: yes, even the
   stars would have been at discord with one another, since some have
   their position above, others beneath, and night would have refused to
   make way for day, but would have persisted in remaining to fight and
   strive against it. 3. But if this were so, we should consequently see
   not an ordered universe, but disorder, not arrangement but anarchy, not
   a system, but everything out of system, not proportion but
   disproportion. For in the general strife and conflict either all things
   would be destroyed, or the prevailing principle alone would appear. And
   even the latter would shew the disorder of the whole, for left alone,
   and deprived of the help of the others, it would throw the whole out of
   gear, just as, if a single hand and foot were left alone, that would
   not preserve the body in its integrity. 4. For what sort of an universe
   would it be, if only the sun appeared, or only the moon went her
   course, or there were only night, or always day? Or what sort of
   harmony would it be, again, if the heaven existed alone without the
   stars, or the stars without the heaven? Or what benefit would there be
   if there were only sea, or if the earth were there alone without waters
   and without the other parts of creation? Or how could man, or any
   animal, have appeared upon earth, if the elements were mutually at
   strife, or if there were one that prevailed, and that one insufficient
   for the composition of bodies. For nothing in the world could have been
   composed of heat, or cold, or wet, or dry, alone, but all would have
   been without arrangement or combination. But not even the one element
   which appeared to prevail would have been able to subsist without the
   assistance of the rest: for that is how each subsists now.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§38. The Unity of God shewn by the Harmony of the order of Nature.

   Since then, there is everywhere not disorder but order, proportion and
   not disproportion, not disarray but arrangement, and that in an order
   perfectly harmonious, we needs must infer and be led to perceive the
   Master that put together and compacted all things, and produced harmony
   in them. For though He be not seen with the eyes, yet from the order
   and harmony of things contrary it is possible to perceive their Ruler,
   Arranger, and King. 2. For in like manner as if we saw a city,
   consisting of many and diverse people, great and small, rich and poor,
   old and young, male and female, in an orderly condition, and its
   inhabitants, while different from one another, yet at unity among
   themselves, and not the rich set against the poor, the great against
   the small, nor the young against the old, but all at peace in the
   enjoyment of equal rights,--if we saw this, the inference surely
   follows that the presence of a ruler enforces concord, even if we do
   not see him; (for disorder is a sign of absence of rule, while order
   shews the governing authority: for when we see the mutual harmony of
   the members in the body, that the eye does not strive with the hearing,
   nor is the hand at variance with the foot, but that each accomplishes
   its service without variance, we perceive from this that certainly
   there is a soul in the body that governs these members, though we see
   it not); so in the order and harmony of the Universe, we needs must
   perceive God the governor of it all, and that He is one and not many.
   3. So then this order of its arrangement, and the concordant harmony of
   all things, shews that the Word, its Ruler and Governor, is not many,
   but One. For if there were more than one Ruler of Creation, such an
   universal order would not be maintained, but all things would fall into
   confusion because of their plurality, each one biasing the whole to his
   own will, and striving with the other. For just as we said that
   polytheism was atheism, so it follows that the rule of more than one is
   the rule of none. For each one would cancel the rule of the other, and
   none would appear ruler, but there would be anarchy everywhere. But
   where no ruler is, there disorder follows of course. 4. And conversely,
   the single order and concord of the many and diverse shews that the
   ruler too is one. For just as though one were to hear from a distance a
   lyre, composed of many diverse strings, and marvel at the concord of
   its symphony, in that its sound is composed neither of low notes
   exclusively, nor high nor intermediate only, but all combine their
   sounds in equal balance,--and would not fail to perceive from this that
   the lyre was not playing itself, nor even being struck by more persons
   than one, but that there was one musician, even if he did not see him,
   who by his skill combined the sound of each string into the tuneful
   symphony; so, the order of the whole universe being perfectly
   harmonious, and there being no strife of the higher against the lower
   or the lower against the higher, and all things making up one order, it
   is consistent to think that the Ruler and King of all Creation is one
   and not many, Who by His own light illumines and gives movement to all.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§39. Impossibility of a plurality of Gods.

   For we must not think there is more than one ruler and maker of
   Creation: but it belongs to correct and true religion to believe that
   its Artificer is one, while Creation herself clearly points to this.
   For the fact that there is one Universe only and not more is a
   conclusive proof that its Maker is one. For if there were a plurality
   of gods, there would necessarily be also more universes than one. For
   neither were it reasonable for more than one God to make a single
   universe, nor for the one universe to be made by more than one, because
   of the absurdities which would result from this. 2. Firstly, if the one
   universe were made by a plurality of gods, that would mean weakness on
   the part of those who made it, because many contributed to a single
   result; which would be a strong proof of the imperfect creative skill
   of each. For if one were sufficient, the many would not supplement each
   other's deficiency. But to say that there is any deficiency in God is
   not only impious, but even beyond all sacrilege. For even among men one
   would not call a workman perfect if he were unable to finish his work,
   a single piece, by himself and without the aid of several others. 3.
   But if, although each one was able to accomplish the whole, yet all
   worked at it in order to claim a share in the result, we have the
   laughable conclusion that each worked for reputation, lest he should be
   suspected of inability. But, once more, it is most grotesque to ascribe
   vainglory to gods. 4. Again, if each one were sufficient for the
   creation of the whole, what need of more than one, one being
   self-sufficient for the universe? Moreover it would be evidently
   impious and grotesque, to make the thing created one, while the
   creators were many and different, it being a maxim of science [159]
   that what is one and complete is higher than things that are diverse.
   5. And this you must know, that if the universe had been made by a
   plurality of gods, its movements would be diverse and inconsistent. For
   having regard to each one of its makers, its movements would be
   correspondingly different. But such difference again, as was said
   before, would involve disarray and general disorder; for not even a
   ship will sail aright if she be steered by many, unless one pilot hold
   the tiller [160] , nor will a lyre struck by many produce a tuneful
   sound, unless there be one artist who strikes it. 6. Creation, then,
   being one, and the Universe one, and its order one, we must perceive
   that its King and Artificer also is one. For this is why the Artificer
   Himself made the whole universe one, lest by the coexistence of more
   than one a plurality of makers should be supposed; but that as the work
   is one, its Maker also may be believed to be One. Nor does it follow
   from the unity of the Maker that the Universe must be one, for God
   might have made others as well. But because the Universe that has been
   made is one, it is necessary to believe that its Maker also is one.

   Â§40. The rationality and order of the Universe proves that it is the
   work of the Reason or Word of God.

   Who then might this Maker be? for this is a point most necessary to
   make plain, lest, from ignorance with regard to him, a man should
   suppose the wrong maker, and fall once more into the same old godless
   error, but I think no one is really in doubt about it. For if our
   argument has proved that the gods of the poets are no gods, and has
   convicted of error those that deify creation, and in general has shewn
   that the idolatry of the heathen is godlessness and impiety, it
   strictly follows from the elimination of these that the true religion
   is with us, and that the God we worship and preach is the only true
   One, Who is Lord of Creation and Maker of all existence. 2. Who then is
   this, save the Father of Christ, most holy and above all created
   existence [161] , Who like an excellent pilot, by His own Wisdom and
   His own Word, our Lord and Saviour Christ, steers and preserves and
   orders all things, and does as seems to Him best? But that is best
   which has been done, and which we see taking place, since that is what
   He wills; and this a man can hardly refuse to believe. 3. For if the
   movement of creation were irrational, and the universe were borne along
   without plan, a man might fairly disbelieve what we say. But if it
   subsist in reason and wisdom and skill, and is perfectly ordered
   throughout, it follows that He that is over it and has ordered it is
   none other than the [reason or] Word of God. 4. But by Word I mean, not
   that which is involved and inherent in all things created, which some
   are wont to call the seminal [162] principle, which is without soul and
   has no power of reason or thought, but only works by external art,
   according to the skill of him that applies it,--nor such a word as
   belongs to rational beings and which consists of syllables, and has the
   air as its vehicle of expression,--but I mean the living and powerful
   Word of the good God, the God of the Universe, the very Word which is
   God [163] , Who while different from things that are made, and from all
   Creation, is the One own Word of the good Father, Who by His own
   providence ordered and illumines this Universe. 5. For being the good
   Word of the Good Father He produced the order of all things, combining
   one with another things contrary, and reducing them to one harmonious
   order. He being the Power of God and Wisdom of God causes the heaven to
   revolve, and has suspended the earth, and made it fast, though resting
   upon nothing, by His own nod [164] . Illumined by Him, the sun gives
   light to the world, and the moon has her measured period of shining. By
   reason of Him the water is suspended in the clouds; the rains shower
   upon the earth, and the sea is kept within bounds, while the earth
   bears grasses and is clothed with all manner of plants. 6. And if a man
   were incredulously to ask, as regards what we are saying, if there be a
   Word of God at all [165] , such an one would indeed be mad to doubt
   concerning the Word of God, but yet demonstration is possible from what
   is seen, because all things subsist by the Word and Wisdom of God, nor
   would any created thing have had a fixed existence had it not been made
   by reason, and that reason the Word of God, as we have said.

   Â§41. The Presence of the Word in nature necessary, not only for its
   original Creation, but also for its permanence.

   But though He is Word, He is not, as we said, after the likeness of
   human words, composed of syllables; but He is the unchanging Image of
   His own Father. For men, composed of parts and made out of nothing,
   have their discourse composite and divisible. But God possesses true
   existence and is not composite, wherefore His Word also has true
   Existence and is not composite, but is the one and only-begotten God
   [166] , Who proceeds in His goodness from the Father as from a good
   Fountain, and orders all things and holds them together. 2. But the
   reason why the Word, the Word of God, has united Himself [167] with
   created things is truly wonderful, and teaches us that the present
   order of things is none otherwise than is fitting. For the nature of
   created things, inasmuch as it is brought into being out of nothing, is
   of a fleeting sort, and weak and mortal, if composed of itself only.
   But the God of all is good and exceeding noble by nature,--and
   therefore is kind. For one that is good can grudge nothing [168] : for
   which reason he does not grudge even existence, but desires all to
   exist, as objects for His loving-kindness. 3. Seeing then all created
   nature, as far as its own laws were concerned, to be fleeting and
   subject to dissolution, lest it should come to this and lest the
   Universe should be broken up again into nothingness, for this cause He
   made all things by His own eternal Word, and gave substantive existence
   to Creation, and moreover did not leave it to be tossed in a tempest in
   the course of its own nature, lest it should run the risk of once more
   dropping out of existence [169] ; but, because He is good He guides and
   settles the whole Creation by His own Word, Who is Himself also God,
   that by the governance and providence and ordering action of the Word,
   Creation may have light, and be enabled to abide alway securely. For it
   partakes of the Word Who derives true existence from the Father, and is
   helped by Him so as to exist, lest that should come to it which would
   have come but for the maintenance of it by the Word,--namely,
   dissolution,--"for He is the Image of the invisible God, the first-born
   of all Creation, for through Him and in Him all things consist, things
   visible and things invisible, and He is the Head of the Church," as the
   ministers of truth teach in their holy writings [170] .

   Â§42. This function of the Word described at length.

   The holy Word of the Father, then, almighty and all-perfect, uniting
   with the universe and having everywhere unfolded His own powers, and
   having illumined all, both things seen and things invisible, holds them
   together and binds them to Himself, having left nothing void of His own
   power, but on the contrary quickening and sustaining all things
   everywhere, each severally and all collectively; while He mingles in
   one the principles of all sensible existence, heat namely and cold and
   wet and dry, and causes them not to conflict, but to make up one
   concordant harmony. 2. By reason of Him and His power, fire does not
   fight with cold nor wet with dry, but principles mutually opposed, as
   if friendly and brotherly combine together, and give life to the things
   we see, and form the principles by which bodies exist. Obeying Him,
   even God the Word, things on earth have life and things in the heaven
   have their order. By reason of Him all the sea, and the great ocean,
   move within their proper bounds, while, as we said above, the dry land
   grows grasses and is clothed with all manner of diverse plants. And,
   not to spend time in the enumeration of particulars, where the truth is
   obvious, there is nothing that is and takes place but has been made and
   stands by Him and through Him, as also the Divine [171] says, "In the
   beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
   God; all things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything
   made." 3. For just as though some musician, having tuned a lyre, and by
   his art adjusted the high notes to the low, and the intermediate notes
   to the rest, were to produce a single tune as the result, so also the
   Wisdom of God, handling the Universe as a lyre, and adjusting things in
   the air to things on the earth, and things in the heaven to things in
   the air, and combining parts into wholes and moving them all by His
   beck and will, produces well and fittingly, as the result, the unity of
   the universe and of its order, Himself remaining unmoved with the
   Father while He moves all things by His organising action, as seems
   good for each to His own Father. 4. For what is surprising in His
   godhead is this, that by one and the same act of will He moves all
   things simultaneously, and not at intervals, but all collectively, both
   straight and curved, things above and beneath and intermediate, wet,
   cold, warm, seen and invisible, and orders them according to their
   several nature. For simultaneously at His single nod what is straight
   moves as straight, what is curved also, and what is intermediate,
   follows its own movement; what is warm receives warmth, what is dry
   dryness, and all things according to their several nature are quickened
   and organised by Him, and He produces as the result a marvellous and
   truly divine harmony.

   Â§43. Three similes to illustrate the Word's relation to the Universe.

   And for so great a matter to be understood by an example, let what we
   are describing be compared to a great chorus. As then the chorus is
   composed of different people, children, women again, and old men, and
   those who are still young, and, when one, namely the conductor, gives
   the sign, each utters sound according to his nature and power, the man
   as a man, the child as a child, the old man as an old man, and the
   young man as a young man, while all make up a single harmony; 2. or as
   our soul at one time moves our several senses according to the proper
   function of each, so that when some one object is present all alike are
   put in motion, and the eye sees, the ear hears, the hand touches, the
   smell takes in odour, and the palate tastes,--and often the other parts
   of the body act too, as for instance if the feet walk; 3. or, to make
   our meaning plain by yet a third example, it is as though a very great
   city were built, and administered under the presence of the ruler and
   king who has built it; for when he is present and gives orders, and has
   his eye upon everything, all obey; some busy themselves with
   agriculture, others hasten for water to the aqueducts, another goes
   forth to procure provisions,--one goes to senate, another enters the
   assembly, the judge goes to the bench, and the magistrate to his court.
   The workman likewise settles to his craft, the sailor goes down to the
   sea, the carpenter to his workshop, the physician to his treatment, the
   architect to his building; and while one is going to the country,
   another is returning from the country, and while some walk about the
   town others are going out of the town and returning to it again: but
   all this is going on and is organised by the presence of the one Ruler,
   and by his management: 4. in like manner then we must conceive of the
   whole of Creation, even though the example be inadequate, yet with an
   enlarged idea. For with the single impulse of a nod as it were of the
   Word of God, all things simultaneously fall into order, and each
   discharge their proper functions, and a single order is made up by them
   all together.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§44. The similes applied to the whole Universe, seen and unseen.

   For by a nod and by the power of the Divine Word of the Father that
   governs and presides over all, the heaven revolves, the stars move, the
   sun shines, the moon goes her circuit, and the air receives the sun's
   light and the Ã¦ther his heat, and the winds blow: the mountains are
   reared on high, the sea is rough with waves, and the living things in
   it grow, the earth abides fixed, and bears fruit, and man is formed and
   lives and dies again, and all things whatever have their life and
   movement; fire burns, water cools, fountains spring forth, rivers flow,
   seasons and hours come round, rains descend, clouds are filled, hail is
   formed, snow and ice congeal, birds fly, creeping things go along,
   water-animals swim, the sea is navigated, the earth is sown and grows
   crops in due season, plants grow, and some are young, some ripening,
   others in their growth become old and decay, and while some things are
   vanishing others are being engendered and are coming to light. 2. But
   all these things, and more, which for their number we cannot mention,
   the worker of wonders and marvels, the Word of God, giving light and
   life, moves and orders by His own nod, making the universe one. Nor
   does He leave out of Himself even the invisible powers; for including
   these also in the universe inasmuch as he is their maker also, He holds
   them together and quickens them by His nod and by His providence. And
   there can be no excuse for disbelieving this. 3. For as by His own
   providence bodies grow and the rational soul moves, and possesses life
   and thought, and this requires little proof, for we see what takes
   place,--so again the same Word of God with one simple nod by His own
   power moves and holds together both the visible universe and the
   invisible powers, allotting to each its proper function, so that the
   divine powers move in a diviner way, while visible things move as they
   are seen to do. But Himself being over all, both Governor and King and
   organising power, He does all for the glory and knowledge of His own
   Father, so that almost by the very works that He brings to pass He
   teaches us and says, "By the greatness and beauty of the creatures
   proportionably the maker of them is seen [172] ."

   Â§45. Conclusion. Doctrine of Scripture on the subject of Part I.

   For just as by looking up to the heaven and seeing its order and the
   light of the stars, it is possible to infer the Word Who ordered these
   things, so by beholding the Word of God, one needs must behold also God
   His Father, proceeding from Whom He is rightly called His Father's
   Interpreter and Messenger. 2. And this one may see from our own
   experience; for if when a word proceeds from men [173] we infer that
   the mind is its source, and, by thinking about the word, see with our
   reason the mind which it reveals, by far greater evidence and
   incomparably more, seeing the power of the Word, we receive a knowledge
   also of His good Father, as the Saviour Himself says, "He that hath
   seen Me hath seen the Father [174] ." But this all inspired Scripture
   also teaches more plainly and with more authority, so that we in our
   turn write boldly to you as we do, and you, if you refer to them, will
   be able to verify what we say. 3. For an argument when confirmed by
   higher authority is irresistibly proved. From the first then the divine
   Word firmly taught the Jewish people about the abolition of idols when
   it said [175] : "Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven image, nor the
   likeness of anything that is in the heaven above or in the earth
   beneath." But the cause of their abolition another writer declares
   [176] , saying: "The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the
   works of men's hands: a mouth have they and will not speak, eyes have
   they and will not see, ears have they and will not hear, noses have
   they and will not smell, hands have they and will not handle, feet have
   they and will not walk." Nor has it passed over in silence the doctrine
   of creation; but, knowing well its beauty, lest any attending solely to
   this beauty should worship things as if they were gods, instead of
   God's works, it teaches men firmly beforehand when it says [177] : "And
   do not when thou lookest up with thine eyes and seest the sun and moon
   and all the host of heaven, go astray and worship them, which the Lord
   thy God hath given to all nations under heaven." But He gave them, not
   to be their gods, but that by their agency the Gentiles should know, as
   we have said, God the Maker of them all. 4. For the people of the Jews
   of old had abundant teaching, in that they had the knowledge of God not
   only from the works of Creation, but also from the divine Scriptures.
   And in general to draw men away from the error and irrational
   imagination of idols, He saith [178] : "Thou shalt have none other gods
   but Me." Not as if there were other gods does He forbid them to have
   them, but lest any, turning from the true God, should begin to make
   himself gods of what were not, such as those who in the poets and
   writers are called gods, though they are none. And the language itself
   shews that they are no Gods, when it says, "Thou shalt have none other
   gods," which refers only to the future. But what is referred to the
   future does not exist at the time of speaking.

   Â§46. Doctrine of Scripture on the subject of Part 3.

   Has then the divine teaching, which abolished the godlessness of the
   heathen or the idols, passed over in silence, and left the race of
   mankind to go entirely unprovided with the knowledge of God? Not so:
   rather it anticipates their understanding when it says [179] : "Hear, O
   Israel, the Lord thy God is one God;" and again, "Thou shalt love the
   Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy strength;" and again,
   "Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve,
   and shalt cleave to Him." 2. But that the providence and ordering power
   of the Word also, over all and toward all, is attested by all inspired
   Scripture, this passage suffices to confirm our argument, where men who
   speak of God say [180] : "Thou hast laid the foundation of the earth
   and it abideth. The day continueth according to Thine ordinance." And
   again [181] : "Sing to our God upon the harp, that covereth the heaven
   with clouds, that prepareth rain for the earth, that bringeth forth
   grass upon the mountains, and green herb for the service of man, and
   giveth food to the cattle." 3. But by whom does He give it, save by Him
   through Whom all things were made? For the providence over all things
   belongs naturally to Him by Whom they were made; and who is this save
   the Word of God, concerning Whom in another psalm [182] he says: "By
   the Word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by
   the Breath of His mouth." For He tells us that all things were made in
   Him and through Him. 4. Wherefore He also persuades us and says [183] ,
   "He spake and they were made, He commanded and they were created;" as
   the illustrious Moses also at the beginning of his account of Creation
   confirms what we say by his narrative [184] , saying: and God said,
   "let us make man in our image and after our likeness:" for also when He
   was carrying out the creation of the heaven and earth and all things,
   the Father said to Him [185] , "Let the heaven be made," and "let the
   waters be gathered together and let the dry land appear," and "let the
   earth bring forth herb" and "every green thing:" so that one must
   convict Jews also of not genuinely attending to the Scriptures. 5. For
   one might ask them to whom was God speaking, to use the imperative
   mood? If He were commanding and addressing the things He was creating,
   the utterance would be redundant, for they were not yet in being, but
   were about to be made; but no one speaks to what does not exist, nor
   addresses to what is not yet made a command to be made. For if God were
   giving a command to the things that were to be, He must have said, "Be
   made, heaven, and be made, earth, and come forth, green herb, and be
   created, O man." But in fact He did not do so; but He gives the command
   thus: "Let us make man," and "let the green herb come forth." By which
   God is proved to be speaking about them to some one at hand: it follows
   then that some one was with Him to Whom He spoke when He made all
   things. 6. Who then could it be, save His Word? For to whom could God
   be said to speak, except His Word? Or who was with Him when He made all
   created Existence, except His Wisdom, which says [186] : "When He was
   making the heaven and the earth I was present with Him?" But in the
   mention of heaven and earth, all created things in heaven and earth are
   included as well. 7. But being present with Him as His Wisdom and His
   Word, looking at the Father He fashioned the Universe, and organised it
   and gave it order; and, as He is the power of the Father, He gave all
   things strength to be, as the Saviour says [187] : "What things soever
   I see the Father doing, I also do in like manner." And His holy
   disciples teach that all things were made "through Him and unto Him;"
   8. and, being the good Offspring of Him that is good, and true Son, He
   is the Father's Power and Wisdom and Word, not being so by
   participation [188] , nor as if these qualifies were imparted to Him
   from without, as they are to those who partake of Him and are made wise
   by Him, and receive power and reason in Him; but He is the very Wisdom,
   very Word, and very own Power of the Father, very Light, very Truth,
   very Righteousness, very Virtue, and in truth His express Image, and
   Brightness, and Resemblance. And to sum all up, He is the wholly
   perfect Fruit of the Father, and is alone the Son, and unchanging Image
   of the Father.

   Â§47. Necessity of a return to the Word if our corrupt nature is to be
   restored.

   Who then, who can declare the Father by number, so as to discover the
   powers of His Word? For like as He is the Father's Word and Wisdom, so
   too condescending to created things, He becomes, to impart the
   knowledge and apprehension of Him that begot Him, His very Brightness
   and very Life, and the Door, and the Shepherd, and the Way, and King
   and Governor, and Saviour over all, and Light, and Giver of Life, and
   Providence over all. Having then such a Son begotten of Himself, good,
   and Creator, the Father did not hide Him out of the sight of His
   creatures, but even day by day reveals Him to all by means of the
   organisation and life of all things, which is His work. 2. But in and
   through Him He reveals Himself also, as the Saviour says [189] : "I in
   the Father and the Father in Me:" so that it follows that the Word is
   in Him that begat Him, and that He that is begotten lives eternally
   with the Father. But this being so, and nothing being outside Him, but
   both heaven and earth and all that in them is being dependent on Him,
   yet men in their folly have set aside the knowledge and service of Him,
   and honoured things that are not instead of things that are: and
   instead of the real and true God deified things that were not, "serving
   the creature rather than the Creator [190] ," thus involving themselves
   in foolishness and impiety. 3. For it is just as if one were to admire
   the works more than the workman, and being awestruck at the public
   works in the city, were to make light of their builder, or as if one
   were to praise a musical instrument but to despise the man who made and
   tuned it. Foolish and sadly disabled in eyesight! For how else had they
   known the building, or ship, or lyre, had not the ship-builder made it,
   the architect built it, or the musician fashioned it? 4. As then he
   that reasons in such a way is mad, and beyond all madness, even so
   affected in mind, I think, are those who do not recognise God or
   worship His Word, our Lord Jesus Christ the Saviour of all, through
   Whom the Father orders, and holds together all things, and exercises
   providence over the Universe; having faith and piety towards Whom, my
   Christ-loving friend, be of good cheer and of good hope, because
   immortality and the kingdom of heaven is the fruit of faith and
   devotion towards Him, if only the soul be adorned according to His
   laws. For just as for them who walk after His example, the prize is
   life everlasting, so for those who walk the opposite way, and not that
   of virtue, there is great shame, and peril without pardon in the day of
   judgment, because although they knew the way of truth their acts were
   contrary to their knowledge.

   Introduction to the Treatise

   on the

   Incarnation of the Word.

   ------------------------

   The tract against the Gentiles' leaves the reader face to face with the
   necessity of restoration by the Divine Word as the remedy for corrupt
   human nature. How this necessity is met in the Incarnation is shewn in
   the pages which follow. The general design of the second tract is to
   illustrate and confirm the doctrine of the Incarnation by shewing (1)
   its necessity and end, (2) the congruity of its details, (3) its truth,
   as against the objections of Jews and Gentiles, (4) its result. He
   begins by a review (recapitulating c. Gent. 2-7) of the doctrine of
   creation and of man's place therein. The abuse by man of his special
   Privilege had resulted in its loss. By foregoing the Divine Life, man
   had entered upon a course of endless undoing, of progressive decay,
   from which none could rescue him but the original bestower of his life
   (2-7). Then follows a description in glowing words of the Incarnation
   of the Divine Word and of its efficacy against the plague of corruption
   (8-10). With the Divine Life, man had also received, in the knowledge
   of God, the conscious reflex of the Divine Likeness, the faculty of
   reason in its highest exercise. This knowledge their moral fall dimmed
   and perverted. Heeding not even the means by which God sought to remind
   them of Himself, they fell deeper and deeper into materialism and
   superstition. To restore the effaced likeness the presence of the
   Original was requisite. Accordingly, condescending to man's sense-bound
   intelligence--lest men should have been created in vain in the Image of
   God--the Word took Flesh and became an object of Sense, that through
   the Seen He might reveal the Invisible (11-16).

   Having dwelt (17-19) upon the meaning and purpose of the Incarnation,
   he proceeds to speak of the Death and Resurrection of the Incarnate
   Word. He, Who alone could renew the handiwork and restore the likeness
   and give afresh the knowledge of God, must needs, in order to pay the
   debt which all had incurred (to para panton opheilomenon), die in our
   stead, offering the sacrifice on behalf of all, so as to rise again, as
   our first-fruits, from the grave (20-32, note especially Â§20). After
   speaking of the especial fitness of the Cross, once the instrument of
   shame, now the trophy of victory, and after meeting some difficulties
   connected with the manner of the Lord's Death, he passes to the
   Resurrection. He shews how Christ by His triumph over the grave changed
   (27) the relative ascendancy of Death and Life: and how the
   Resurrection with its momentous train of consequences, follows of
   necessity (31) from the Incarnation of Him in Whom was Life.

   The two main divisions of contemporary unbelief are next combated. In
   either case the root of the difficulty is moral; with the Greeks it is
   a frivolous cynicism, with the Jews, inveterate obstinacy. The latter
   (33-40) are confuted, firstly, by their own Scriptures, which predict
   both in general and in detail the coming of Jesus Christ. Also, the old
   Jewish polity, both civil and religious, has passed away, giving place
   to the Church of Christ.

   Turning to the Greeks (41-45), and assuming that they allow the
   existence of a pervading Spirit, whose presence is the sustaining
   principle of all things, he challenges them to reject, without
   inconsistency, the Union of that Spirit, the Logos (compare St.
   Augustine Conf. VII. ix.), with one in particular of the many
   constituents of that Universe wherein he already dwells. And since man
   alone (43. 3) of the creatures had departed from the order of his
   creation, it was man's nature that the Word united to Himself, thus
   repairing the breach between the creature and the Creator at the very
   point where it had occurred.

   God did not restore man by a mere fiat (44) because, just as repentance
   on man's part (7) could not eradicate his disease, so such a fiat on
   God's part would have amounted to the annihilation of human nature as
   it was, and the creation of a fresh race. Man's definite disorder God
   met with a specific remedy, overcoming death with life. Thus man has
   been enabled once more to shew forth, in common with the rest of
   Creation, the handiwork and glory of his Maker.

   Athanasius then confronts the Greeks, as he had the Jews, with facts.
   Since the coming of Christ, paganism, popular and philosophic, had been
   falling into discredit and decay. The impotence and rivalries of the
   philosophic teachers, the local and heterogeneous character, the low
   moral ideals of the old worships, are contrasted with the oneness and
   inspiring power of the religion of the Crucified. Such are the two, the
   dying and the living systems; it remains for him who will to taste and
   see what that life is which is the gift of Christ to them that follow
   Him (46-end).

   The purpose of the tract, in common with the contra Gentes, being to
   commend the religion of Christ to acceptance, the argument is concerned
   more with the Incarnation as a living fact, and with its place in the
   scheme of God's dealing with man, than with its analysis as a
   theological doctrine. He does not enter upon the question, fruitful of
   controversy in the previous century at Alexandria, but soon to burst
   forth into furious debate, of the Sonship of the Word and of His
   relation to God the Father. Still less does he touch the Christological
   questions which arose with the decline of the Arian tempest, questions
   associated with the names of Apollinarius, Theodore, Cyril, Nestorius,
   Eutyches, Theodoret, and Dioscorus. But we feel already that firm grasp
   of soteriological principles which mark him out as the destined
   conqueror of Arianism, and which enabled him by a sure instinct to
   anticipate unconsciously the theological difficulties which troubled
   the Church for the century after his death. It is the broad
   comprehensive treatment of the subject in its relation to God, human
   nature, and sin, that gives the work its interest to readers of the
   present day. In strong reaction from modern or medieval theories of
   Redemption, which to the thoughtful Christian of to-day seem arbitrary,
   or worse, it is with relief that men find that from the beginning it
   was not so; that the theology of the early Church interpreted the great
   Mystery of godliness in terms which, if short of the fulness of the
   Pauline conception, are yet so free from arbitrary assumptions, so true
   to human nature as the wisest of men know it, so true to the worthiest
   and grandest ideas of God (see below, p. 33 ad fin.). The de
   Incarnatione, then, is perhaps more appreciated in our day than at any
   date since the days of its writer.

   It may therefore be worth while to devote a word or two to some
   peculiarities incidental to its aim and method. We observe first of all
   how completely the power of the writer is absorbed in the subject under
   discussion. It is therefore highly precarious to infer anything from
   his silence even on points which might seem to require explanation in
   the course of his argument. Not a word is said of the doctrine of the
   Trinity, nor of the Holy Spirit; this directly follows from the purpose
   of the work, in accordance with the general truth that while the Church
   preaches Christ to the World, the Office and Personality of the Spirit
   belongs to her inner life. The teaching of the tract with regard to the
   constitution of man is another case in point. It might appear (Â§3, cf.
   11. 2, 13. 2) that Athanasius ascribed the reasonable soul of man, and
   his immortality after death, not to the constitution of human nature as
   such, but to the grace superadded to it by the Creator (he tou kat'
   eikona charis), a grace which constituted men logikoi (3. 4) by virtue
   of the power of the Logos, and which, if not forfeited by sin, involved
   the privilege of immortality. We have, then, to carefully consider
   whether Athanasius held, or meant to suggest, that man is by nature,
   and apart from union with God, (1) rational, or (2) immortal. If we
   confine our view to the treatise before us, there would be some show of
   reason in answering both questions in the negative; and with regard to
   immortality this has been recently done by an able correspondent of The
   Times (April 9, 1890).

   But that Athanasius held the essential rationality and immortality of
   the soul is absolutely clear, if only from c. Gent. 32 and 33. We have,
   then, to find an explanation of his language in the present treatise.
   With regard to immortality, it should be observed (1) that the language
   employed (in 4. 5, where kenothenai tou einai aei is explained by to
   dialuthentas menein en to thanato kai te phthora) suggests a continued
   condition, and therefore something short of annihilation, although not
   worthy of the name of existence or life,--(2) that even in the worst of
   men the image of God is defaced, but not effaced (14. 1, &c.), and that
   even when grace is lost (7. 4), man cannot be as though the contact
   with the divine had never taken place;--(3) that in this work, as by
   St. Paul in 1 Cor. xv., the final destiny of the wicked is passed over
   (but for the general reference 56. 3) in silence. It may be added (4)
   that Athanasius puts together all that separates man from irrational
   creatures without clearly drawing the line between what belongs to the
   natural man and what to the kat' eikona charis. The subject of
   eschatology is nowhere dealt with in full by Athanasius; while it is
   quite certain (c. Gent. 33) that he did not share the inclination of
   some earlier writers (see D.C.B. ii. p. 192) toward the idea of
   conditional immortality, there is also no reason to think that he held
   with the Universalism of Origen, Gregory of Nyssa and others (see
   Migne, Patr. Gr. xxvii. p. 1404 A, also 1384 C, where the unfortunate
   Origen's' opinions seem to be rejected, but with an implied deprecation
   of harsh judgment). As to his view of the essential rationality of man
   (see c. Gent. 32) the consideration (4) urged above once more applies
   (compare the discussion in Harnack, Dg. ii. 146 sqq.). Yet he says that
   man left to himself can have no idea of God at all (11. 1), and that
   this would deprive him of any claim to be considered a rational being
   (ib. 2). The apparent inconsistency is removed if we understand that
   man may be rational potentially (as all men are) and yet not rational
   in the sense of exercising reason (which is the case with very many).
   In other words, grace gives not the faculty itself, but its integrity,
   the latter being the result not of the mere psychological existence of
   the faculty, but of the reaction upon it of its highest and adequate
   object. (The same is true to a great extent of the doctrine of pneuma
   in the New Testament.)

   A somewhat similar caution is necessary with regard to the analogy
   drawn out (41, &c.) between the Incarnation and the Union of the Word
   with the Universe. The treatise itself (17. 1, ektos kat' ousian, and
   see notes on 41) supplies the necessary corrective in this case. It may
   be pointed out here that the real difference between Athanasius and the
   neo-Platonists was not so much upon the Union of the Word with any
   created Substance, which they were prepared to allow, as upon the
   exclusive Union of the Word with Man, in Contrast to His essential
   distinctness from the Universe. This difference goes back to the
   doctrine of Creation, which was fixed as a great gulf between the
   Christian and the Platonist view of the Universe. The relation of the
   latter to the Word is fully discussed in the third part of the contra
   Gentes, the teaching of which must be borne in mind while reading the
   forty-first and following chapters of the present treatise.

   Lastly, the close relation between the doctrine of Creation and that of
   Redemption marks off the Soteriology of this treatise from that of the
   middle ages and of the Reformation. Athanasius does not leave out of
   sight the idea of satisfaction for a debt. To him also the Cross was
   the central purpose (20. 2, cf. 9. 1, 2, &c.) of His Coming. But the
   idea of Restoration is most prominent in his determination of the
   necessity of the Incarnation. God could have wiped out our guilt, had
   He so pleased, by a word (44): but human nature required to be healed,
   restored, recreated. This (anaktisai) is the foremost of the three
   ideas (7. 5) which sum up his account of the dignus tanto Vindice nodus
   [191] .

   The translation which follows is that printed in 1885 (D. Nutt, second
   edition, 1891) by the editor of this volume, with a very few changes
   (chiefly 2. 2, 8. 4, 34. 2, 44. 7, 8): it was originally made for the
   purpose of lectures at Oxford (1879-1882), and the analytical headings
   now prefixed to each chapter are extracted verbatim from notes made for
   the same course of lectures. The notes have mostly appeared either in
   the former edition of the translation, or appended to the Greek text
   published (D. Null, 1882) by the translator. A few, however, have now
   been added, including some references to the Sermo Major, which borrows
   wholesale from the present treatise (Prolegg. ch. III. Â§1. 37). Two
   other English translations have appeared, the one (Parker, 1880)
   previous, the other (Religious Tract Society, n.d.) subsequent to that
   of the present translator. The text followed is that of the Benedictine
   editors, with a few exceptions. Of those that at all affect the sense,
   43.6 (kai to soma) and 51. 2 (kata tes eid;) are due to Mr. Marriott
   (Analecta Christiana, Oxf. 1844). For the others (13. 2, omission of
   me, 28. 3, kata tou puros rejecting conjectures of Montf. and Marriott,
   42. 6, omission of pepoiekenai 57. 3, kai ta for ta kai) the present
   editor is alone responsible.

   Introduction. The Redemptive work of the Word based on His initial
   relation to the Creature.

   36

   FIRST PART.--The Incarnation of the Word.

   Â§Â§2, 3.

   Doctrine of Creation:

   (1) Three erroneous views (2) rejected:

   The Epicurean (materialistic) as failing to recognize a differentiating
   Principle.

   36

   The Platonic (matter pre-existent) as not satisfying the idea of God

   37

   The Gnostic (dualistic) as contradictory to Scripture

   37

   (2) The true doctrine (3) and its application to the Creation of Man

   37

   This directly brings us to a

   Â§Â§4-10.

   First Reason for the Incarnation:

   By departing from the Word, men lost the Principle of Life, and were
   wasting away (4, 5)

   38

   God could neither avert nor suffer this (6)

   39

   The latter would argue weakness, the former changeableness (7) on God's
   part

   39

   The Word alone could solve this dilemma (7. 4). This done by His
   becoming man (8) and dying for us all (9). Reasonableness, and results
   of this (10)

   40

   Â§Â§11-16.

   Second Reason for the Incarnation:

   In departing from the Word, men had also lost the Principle of Reason,
   by which they knew God. In spite of God's witness to Himself, they were
   sunk into superstition and mental degradation (11, 12)

   42

   How none but the Word could remedy this (13, 14)

   43

   How He actually did so (15, 16). The Incarnation, a revelation of the
   Invisible Godhead

   44

   (Â§Â§17, 18 explain this in further detail)

   45

   Â§19.

   Transition to Second Part:

   The Incarnation an irresistible revelation of God. This is especially
   true of the Death of Christ.

   46

   SECOND PART.--The Death and Resurrection of Christ.

   His Death:

   Â§20.

   1.--Why necessary

   47

   Â§Â§21-25.

   2.--Why death by Crucifixion--

   a.--Why public, and not natural, but at the hands of others (21-23)

   47

   b.--Why not of His own choosing (24)

   49

   c.--Why the Cross, of all deaths (25)

   49

   His rising again:

   Â§26.

   1.--Why on the third day

   50

   Â§27.

   2.--Changed relation of Death to mankind

   50

   Â§Â§28-32.

   3.--Reality of His Resurrection--This:

   51

   c.--Involved in the Nature of the Incarnate Word (31. 4)

   53

   unseen God (32. 1-5)

   53

   Summary of what is thus proved to be true (32. 6)

   53

   THIRD PART.--Refutation of Contemporary Unbelief.

   Â§Â§33-40.

   reasonably be supposed to unite Himself to some particular nature:
   consequently, to human nature

   On the Incarnation of the Word.

   ------------------------

   Â§1. Introductory.--The subject of this treatise: the humiliation and
   incarnation of the Word. Presupposes the doctrine of Creation, and that
   by the Word. The Father has saved the world by Him through Whom he
   first made it.

   Whereas in what precedes we have drawn out--choosing a few points from
   among many--a sufficient account of the error of the heathen concerning
   idols, and of the worship of idols, and how they originally came to be
   invented; how, namely, out of wickedness men devised for themselves the
   worshipping of idols: and whereas we have by God's grace noted somewhat
   also of the divinity of the Word of the Father, and of His universal
   Providence and power, and that the Good Father through Him orders all
   things, and all things are moved by Him, and in Him are quickened: come
   now, Macarius [192] (worthy of that name), and true lover of Christ,
   let us follow up the faith of our religion [193] , and set forth also
   what relates to the Word's becoming Man, and to His divine Appearing
   amongst us, which Jews traduce and Greeks laugh to scorn, but we
   worship; in order that, all the more for the seeming low estate of the
   Word, your piety toward Him may be increased and multiplied. 2. For the
   more He is mocked among the unbelieving, the more witness does He give
   of His own Godhead; inasmuch as He not only Himself demonstrates as
   possible what men mistake, thinking impossible, but what men deride as
   unseemly, this by His own goodness He clothes with seemliness, and what
   men, in their conceit of wisdom, laugh at as merely human, He by His
   own power demonstrates to be divine, subduing the pretensions of idols
   by His supposed humiliation--by the Cross--and those who mock and
   disbelieve invisibly winning over to recognise His divinity and power.
   3. But to treat this subject it is necessary to recall what has been
   previously said; in order that you may neither fail to know the cause
   of the bodily appearing of the Word of the Father, so high and so
   great, nor think it a consequence of His own nature that the Saviour
   has worn a body; but that being incorporeal by nature, and Word from
   the beginning, He has yet of the loving-kindness and goodness of His
   own Father been manifested to us in a human body for our salvation. 4.
   It is, then, proper for us to begin the treatment of this subject by
   speaking of the creation of the universe, and of God its Artificer,
   that so it may be duly perceived that the renewal of creation has been
   the work of the self-same Word that made it at the beginning. For it
   will appear not inconsonant for the Father to have wrought its
   salvation in Him by Whose means He made it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [192] See Contra Gentes, i. The word (Makarie) may be an adjective
   only, but its occurrence in both places seems decisive. The name was
   very common (Apol. c. Ar. passim). Macarius' was a Christian, as the
   present passage shews: he is presumed (c. Gent. i. 7) to have access to
   Scripture.

   [193] tes eusebeias. See 1 Tim. iii. 16, and note 1 on De Decr. 1.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§2. Erroneous views of Creation rejected. (1) Epicurean (fortuitous
   generation). But diversity of bodies and parts argues a creating
   intellect. (2.) Platonists (pre-existent matter.) But this subjects God
   to human limitations, making Him not a creator but a mechanic. (3)
   Gnostics (an alien Demiurge). Rejected from Scripture.

   Of the making of the universe and the creation of all things many have
   taken different views, and each man has laid down the law just as he
   pleased. For some say that all things have come into being of
   themselves, and in a chance fashion; as, for example, the Epicureans,
   who tell us in their self-contempt, that universal providence does not
   exist, speaking right in the face of obvious fact and experience. 2.
   For if, as they say, everything has had its beginning of itself, and
   independently of purpose, it would follow that everything had come into
   [194] mere being, so as to be alike and not distinct. For it would
   follow in virtue of the unity of body that everything must be sun or
   moon, and in the case of men it would follow that the whole must be
   hand, or eye, or foot. But as it is this is not so. On the contrary, we
   see a distinction of sun, moon, and earth; and again, in the case of
   human bodies, of foot, hand, and head. Now, such separate arrangement
   as this tells us not of their having come into being of themselves, but
   shews that a cause preceded them; from which cause it is possible to
   apprehend God also as the Maker and Orderer of all.

   3. But others, including Plato, who is in such repute among the Greeks,
   argue that God has made the world out of matter previously existing and
   without beginning. For God could have made nothing had not the material
   existed already; just as the wood must exist ready at hand for the
   carpenter, to enable him to work at all. 4. But in so saying they know
   not that they are investing God with weakness. For if He is not Himself
   the cause of the material, but makes things only of previously existing
   material, He proves to be weak, because unable to produce anything He
   makes without the material; just as it is without doubt a weakness of
   the carpenter not to be able to make anything required without his
   timber. For, ex hypothesi, had not the material existed, God would not
   have made anything. And how could He in that case be called Maker and
   Artificer, if He owes His ability to make to some other source--namely,
   to the material? So that if this be so, God will be on their theory a
   Mechanic only, and not a Creator out of nothing [195] ; if, that is, He
   works at existing material, but is not Himself the cause of the
   material. For He could not in any sense be called Creator unless He is
   Creator of the material of which the things created have in their turn
   been made. 5. But the sectaries imagine to themselves a different
   artificer of all things, other than the Father of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, in deep blindness even as to the words they use. 6. For whereas
   the Lord says to the Jews [196] : "Have ye not read that from the
   beginning He which created them made them male and female, and said,
   For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall
   cleave to his wife, and they twain shall become one flesh?" and then,
   referring to the Creator, says, "What, therefore, God hath joined
   together let not man put asunder:" how come these men to assert that
   the creation is independent of the Father? Or if, in the words of John,
   who says, making no exception, "All things [197] were made by Him," and
   "without Him was not anything made," how could the artificer be
   another, distinct from the Father of Christ?
     __________________________________________________________________

   [194] Or, "been made in one way only." In the next clause I formerly
   translated the difficult words hos epi somatos henos as in the case of
   the universe;' but although the rendering has commended itself to
   others I now reluctantly admit that it puts too much into the Greek (in
   spite of Â§41. 5).

     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§3. The true doctrine. Creation out of nothing, of God's lavish bounty
   of being. Man created above the rest, but incapable of independent
   perseverance. Hence the exceptional and supra-natural gift of being in
   God's Image, with the promise of bliss conditionally upon his
   perseverance in grace.

   Thus do they vainly speculate. But the godly teaching and the faith
   according to Christ brands their foolish language as godlessness. For
   it knows that it was not spontaneously, because forethought is not
   absent; nor of existing matter, because God is not weak; but that out
   of nothing, and without its having any previous existence, God made the
   universe to exist through His word, as He says firstly through Moses:
   "In [198] the beginning God created the heaven and the earth;"
   secondly, in the most edifying book of the Shepherd, "First [199] of
   all believe that God is one, which created and framed all things, and
   made them to exist out of nothing." 2. To which also Paul refers when
   he says, "By [200] faith we understand that the worlds have been framed
   by the Word of God, so that what is seen hath not been made out of
   things which do appear." 3. For God is good, or rather is essentially
   the source of goodness: nor [201] could one that is good be niggardly
   of anything: whence, grudging existence to none, He has made all things
   out of nothing by His own Word, Jesus Christ our Lord. And among these,
   having taken especial pity, above all things on earth, upon the race of
   men, and having perceived its inability, by virtue of the condition of
   its origin, to continue in one stay, He gave them a further gift, and
   He did not barely create man, as He did all the irrational creatures on
   the earth, but made them after His own image, giving them a portion
   even of the power of His own Word; so that having as it were a kind of
   reflexion of the Word, and being made rational, they might be able to
   abide ever in blessedness, living the true life which belongs to the
   saints in paradise. 4. But knowing once more how the will of man could
   sway to either side, in anticipation He secured the grace given them by
   a law and by the spot where He placed them. For He brought them into
   His own garden, and gave them a law: so that, if they kept the grace
   and remained good, they might still keep the life in paradise without
   sorrow or pain or care besides having the promise of incorruption in
   heaven; but that if they transgressed and turned back, and became evil,
   they might know that they were incurring that corruption in death which
   was theirs by nature: no longer to live in paradise, but cast out of it
   from that time forth to die and to abide in death and in corruption. 5.
   Now this is that of which Holy Writ also gives warning, saying in the
   Person of God: "Of every tree [202] that is in the garden, eating thou
   shalt eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, ye shall
   not eat of it, but on the day that ye eat, dying ye shall die." But by
   "dying ye shall die," what else could be meant than not dying merely,
   but also abiding ever in the corruption of death?

   Â§4. Our creation and God's Incarnation most intimately connected. As by
   the Word man was called from non-existence into being, and further
   received the grace of a divine life, so by the one fault which
   forfeited that life they again incurred corruption and untold sin and
   misery filled the world.

   You are wondering, perhaps, for what possible reason, having proposed
   to speak of the Incarnation of the Word, we are at present treating of
   the origin of mankind. But this, too, properly belongs to the aim of
   our treatise. 2. For in speaking of the appearance of the Saviour
   amongst us, we must needs speak also of the origin of men, that you may
   know that the reason of His coming down was because of us, and that our
   transgression [203] called forth the loving-kindness of the Word, that
   the Lord should both make haste to help us and appear among men. 3. For
   of His becoming Incarnate we were the object, and for our salvation He
   dealt so lovingly as to appear and be born even in a human body. 4.
   Thus, then, God has made man, and willed that he should abide in
   incorruption; but men, having despised and rejected the contemplation
   of God, and devised and contrived evil for themselves (as was said
   [204] in the former treatise), received the condemnation of death with
   which they had been threatened; and from thenceforth no longer remained
   as they were made, but [205] were being corrupted according to their
   devices; and death had the mastery over them as king [206] . For
   transgression of the commandment was turning them back to their natural
   state, so that just as they have had their being out of nothing, so
   also, as might be expected, they might look for corruption into nothing
   in the course of time. 5. For if, out of a former normal state of
   non-existence, they were called into being by the Presence and
   loving-kindness of the Word, it followed naturally that when men were
   bereft of the knowledge of God and were turned back to what was not
   (for what is evil is not, but what is good is), they should, since they
   derive their being from God who IS, be everlastingly bereft even of
   being; in other words, that they should be disintegrated and abide in
   death and corruption. 6. For man is by nature mortal, inasmuch as he is
   made out of what is not; but by reason of his likeness to Him that is
   (and if he still preserved this likeness by keeping Him in his
   knowledge) he would stay his natural corruption, and remain incorrupt;
   as Wisdom [207] says: "The taking heed to His laws is the assurance of
   immortality;" but being incorrupt, he would live henceforth as God, to
   which I suppose the divine Scripture refers, when it says: "I have
   [208] said ye are gods, and ye are all sons of the most Highest; but ye
   die like men, and fall as one of the princes."

   Â§5. For God has not only made us out of nothing; but He gave us freely,
   by the Grace of the Word, a life in correspondence with God. But men,
   having rejected things eternal, and, by counsel of the devil, turned to
   the things of corruption, became the cause [209] of their own
   corruption in death, being, as I said before, by nature corruptible,
   but destined, by the grace following from partaking of the Word, to
   have escaped their natural state, had they remained good. 2. For
   because of the Word dwelling with them, even their natural corruption
   did not come near them, as Wisdom also says [210] : "God made man for
   incorruption, and as an image of His own eternity; but by envy of the
   devil death came into the world." But when this was come to pass, men
   began to die, while corruption thence-forward prevailed against them,
   gaining even more than its natural power over the whole race, inasmuch
   as it had, owing to the transgression of the commandment, the threat of
   the Deity as a further advantage against them.

   3. For even in their misdeeds men had not stopped short at any set
   limits; but gradually pressing forward, have passed on beyond all
   measure: having to begin with been inventors of wickedness and called
   down upon themselves death and corruption; while later on, having
   turned aside to wrong and exceeding all lawlessness, and stopping at no
   one evil but devising all manner of new evils in succession, they have
   become insatiable in sinning. 4. For there were adulteries everywhere
   and thefts, and the whole earth was full of murders and plunderings.
   And as to corruption and wrong, no heed was paid to law, but all crimes
   were being practised everywhere, both individually and jointly. Cities
   were at war with cities, and nations were rising up against nations;
   and the whole earth was rent with civil commotions and battles; each
   man vying with his fellows in lawless deeds. 8. Nor were even crimes
   against nature far from them, but, as the Apostle and witness of Christ
   says: "For their [211] women changed the natural use into that which is
   against nature: and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of
   the women, burned in their lust one toward another, men with men
   working unseemliness, and receiving in themselves that recompense of
   their error which was meet."

   Â§6. The human race then was wasting, God's image was being effaced, and
   His work ruined. Either, then, God must forego His spoken word by which
   man had incurred ruin; or that which had shared in the being of the
   Word must sink back again into destruction, in which case God's design
   would be defeated. What then? was God's goodness to suffer this? But if
   so, why had man been made? It could have been weakness, not goodness on
   God's part.

   For this cause, then, death having gained upon men, and corruption
   abiding upon them, the race of man was perishing; the rational man made
   in God's image was disappearing, and the handiwork of God was in
   process of dissolution. 2. For death, as I said above, gained from that
   time forth a legal [212] hold over us, and it was impossible to evade
   the law, since it had been laid down by God because [213] of the
   transgression, and the result was in truth at once monstrous and
   unseemly. 3. For it were monstrous, firstly, that God, having spoken,
   should prove false--that, when once He had ordained that man, if he
   transgressed the commandment, should die the death, after the
   transgression man should not die, but God's word should be broken. For
   God would not be true, if, when He had said we should die, man died
   not. 4. Again, it were unseemly that creatures once made rational, and
   having partaken of the Word, should go to ruin, and turn again toward
   non-existence by the way of corruption [214] . 5. For it were not
   worthy of God's goodness that the things He had made should waste away,
   because of the deceit practised on men by the devil. 6. Especially it
   was unseemly to the last degree that God's handicraft among men should
   be done away, either because of their own carelessness, or because of
   the deceitfulness of evil spirits.

   7. So, as the rational creatures were wasting and such works in course
   of ruin, what was God in His goodness to do? Suffer corruption to
   prevail against them and death to hold them fast? And where were the
   profit of their having been made, to begin with? For better were they
   not made, than once made, left to neglect and ruin. 8. For neglect
   reveals weakness, and not goodness on God's part--if, that is, He
   allows His own work to be ruined when once He had made it--more so than
   if He had never made man at all. 9. For if He had not made them, none
   could impute weakness; but once He had made them, and created them out
   of nothing, it were most monstrous for the work to be ruined, and that
   before the eyes of the Maker. 10. It was, then, out of the question to
   leave men to the current of corruption; because this would be unseemly,
   and unworthy of God's goodness.

   Â§7. On the other hand there was the consistency of God's nature, not to
   be sacrificed for our profit. Were men, then, to be called upon to
   repent? But repentance cannot avert the execution of a law; still less
   can it remedy a fallen nature. We have incurred corruption and need to
   be restored to the Grace of God's Image. None could renew but He Who
   had created. He alone could (1) recreate all, (2) suffer for all, (3)
   represent all to the Father.

   But just as this consequence must needs hold, so, too, on the other
   side the just claims [215] of God lie against it: that God should
   appear true to the law He had laid down concerning death. For it were
   monstrous for God, the Father of truth, to appear a liar for our profit
   and preservation. 2. So here, once more, what possible course was God
   to take? To demand repentance of men for their transgression? For this
   one might pronounce worthy of God; as though, just as from
   transgression men have become set towards corruption, so from
   repentance they may once more be set in the way of incorruption. 3. But
   repentance would, firstly, fail to guard the just claim [216] of God.
   For He would still be none the more true, if men did not remain in the
   grasp of death; nor, secondly, does repentance call men back from what
   is their nature--it merely stays them from acts of sin. 4. Now, if
   there were merely a misdemeanour in question, and not a consequent
   corruption, repentance were well enough. But if, when transgression had
   once gained a start, men became involved in that corruption which was
   their nature, and were deprived of the grace which they had, being in
   the image of God, what further step was needed? or what was required
   for such grace and such recall, but the Word of God, which had also at
   the beginning made everything out of nought? 5. For His it was once
   more both to bring the corruptible to incorruption, and to maintain
   intact the just claim [217] of the Father upon all. For being Word of
   the Father, and above all, He alone of natural fitness was both able to
   recreate everything, and worthy to suffer on behalf of all and to be
   ambassador for all with the Father.

   Â§8. The Word, then, visited that earth in which He was yet always
   present ; and saw all these evils. He takes a body of our Nature, and
   that of a spotless Virgin, in whose womb He makes it His own, wherein
   to reveal Himself, conquer death, and restore life.

   For this purpose, then, the incorporeal and incorruptible and
   immaterial Word of God comes to our realm, howbeit he was not far from
   us [218] before. For no part of Creation is left void of Him: He has
   filled all things everywhere, remaining present with His own Father.
   But He comes in condescension to shew loving-kindness upon us, and to
   visit us. 2. And seeing the race of rational creatures in the way to
   perish, and death reigning over them by corruption; seeing, too, that
   the threat against transgression gave a firm hold to the corruption
   which was upon us, and that it was monstrous that [219] before the law
   was fulfilled it should fall through: seeing, once more, the
   unseemliness of what was come to pass: that the things whereof He
   Himself was Artificer were passing away: seeing, further, the exceeding
   wickedness of men, and how by little and little they had increased it
   to an intolerable pitch against themselves: and seeing, lastly, how all
   men were under penalty of death: He took pity on our race, and had
   mercy on our infirmity, and condescended to our corruption, and, unable
   to bear that death should have the mastery--lest the creature should
   perish, and His Father's handiwork in men be spent for nought--He takes
   unto Himself a body, and that of no different sort from ours. 3. For He
   did not simply will to become embodied, or will merely to appear [220]
   . For if He willed merely to appear, He was able to effect His divine
   appearance by some other and higher means as well. But He takes a body
   of our kind, and not merely so, but from a spotless and stainless
   virgin, knowing not a man, a body clean and in very truth pure from
   intercourse of men. For being Himself mighty, and Artificer of
   everything, He prepares the body in the Virgin as a temple unto
   Himself, and makes it His very own [221] as an instrument, in it
   manifested, and in it dwelling. 4. And thus taking from our bodies one
   of like nature, because all were under penalty of the corruption of
   death He gave it over to death in the stead of all, and offered it to
   the Father--doing this, moreover, of His loving-kindness, to the end
   that, firstly, all being held to have died in Him, the law involving
   the ruin of men might be undone (inasmuch as its power was fully spent
   in the Lord's body, and had no longer holding-ground against men, his
   peers), and that, secondly, whereas men had turned toward corruption,
   He might turn them again toward incorruption, and quicken them from
   death by the appropriation [222] of His body and by the grace of the
   Resurrection, banishing death from them like straw from the fire [223]
   .

   Â§9. The Word, since death alone could stay the plague, took a mortal
   body which, united with Him, should avail for all, and by partaking of
   His immortality stay the corruption of the Race. By being above all, He
   made His Flesh an offering for our souls; by being one with us all, he
   clothed us with immortality. Simile to illustrate this.

   For the Word, perceiving that no otherwise could the corruption of men
   be undone save by death as a necessary condition, while it was
   impossible for the Word to suffer death, being immortal, and Son of the
   Father; to this end He takes to Himself a body capable of death, that
   it, by partaking of the Word Who is above all, might be worthy to die
   in the stead of all, and might, because of the Word which was come to
   dwell in it, remain incorruptible, and that thenceforth corruption
   might be stayed from all by the Grace of the Resurrection. Whence, by
   offering unto death the body He Himself had taken, as an offering and
   sacrifice free from any stain, straightway He put away death from all
   His peers by the offering of an equivalent. 2. For being over all, the
   Word of God naturally by offering His own temple and corporeal
   instrument for the life [224] of all satisfied the debt by His death.
   And thus He, the incorruptible Son of God, being conjoined with all by
   a like nature, naturally clothed all with incorruption, by the promise
   of the resurrection. For the actual corruption in death has no longer
   holding-ground against men, by reason of the Word, which by His one
   body has come to dwell among them. 3. And like as [225] when a great
   king has entered into some large city and taken up his abode in one of
   the houses there, such city is at all events held worthy of high
   honour, nor does any enemy or bandit any longer descend upon it and
   subject it; but, on the contrary, it is thought entitled to all care,
   because of the king's having taken up his residence in a single house
   there: so, too, has it been with the Monarch of all. 4. For now that He
   has come to our realm, and taken up his abode in one body among His
   peers, henceforth the whole conspiracy of the enemy against mankind is
   checked, and the corruption of death which before was prevailing
   against them is done away. For the race of men had gone to ruin, had
   not the Lord and Saviour of all, the Son of God, come among us to meet
   the end of death [226] .

   Â§10. By a like simile, the reasonableness of the work of redemption is
   shewn. How Christ wiped away our ruin, and provided its antidote by His
   own teaching. Scripture proofs of the Incarnation of the Word, and of
   the Sacrifice He wrought.

   Now in truth this great work was peculiarly suited to God's goodness.
   1. For if a king, having founded a house or city, if it be beset by
   bandits from the carelessness of its inmates, does not by any means
   neglect it, but avenges and reclaims it as his own work, having regard
   not to the carelessness of the inhabitants, but to what beseems
   himself; much more did God the Word of the all-good Father not neglect
   the race of men, His work, going to corruption: but, while He blotted
   out the death which had ensued by the offering of His own body, He
   corrected their neglect by His own teaching, restoring all that was
   man's by His own power. 2. And of this one may be assured at the hands
   of the Saviour's own inspired writers, if one happen upon their
   writings, where they say: "For the love of Christ [227] constraineth
   us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then all died, and
   He died for all that we should no longer live unto ourselves, but unto
   Him Who for our sakes died and rose again," our Lord Jesus Christ. And,
   again: "But [228] we behold Him, Who hath been made a little lower than
   the angels, even Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with
   glory and honour, that by the grace of God He should taste of death for
   every man." 3. Then He also points out the reason why it was necessary
   for none other than God the Word Himself to become incarnate; as
   follows: "For it became Him, for Whom are all things, and through Whom
   are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the Captain
   of their salvation perfect through suffering;" by which words He means,
   that it belonged to none other to bring man back from the corruption
   which had begun, than the Word of God, Who had also made them from the
   beginning. 4. And that it was in order to the sacrifice for bodies such
   as His own that the Word Himself also assumed a body, to this, also,
   they refer in these words [229] : "Forasmuch then as the children are
   the sharers in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook
   of the same, that through death He might bring to naught Him that had
   the power of death, that is, the devil; and might deliver them who,
   through fear of death, were all their lifetime subject to bondage." 5.
   For by the sacrifice of His own body, He both put an end to the law
   which was against us, and made a new beginning of life for us, by the
   hope of resurrection which He has given us. For since from man it was
   that death prevailed over men, for this cause conversely, by the Word
   of God being made man has come about the destruction of death and the
   resurrection of life; as the man which bore Christ [230] saith: "For
   [231] since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the
   dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made
   alive:" and so forth. For no longer now do we die as subject to
   condemnation; but as men who rise from the dead we await the general
   resurrection of all, "which [232] in its own times He shall show," even
   God, Who has also wrought it, and bestowed it upon us. 6. This then is
   the first cause of the Saviour's being made man. But one might see from
   the following reasons also, that His gracious coming amongst us was
   fitting to have taken place.

   Â§11. Second reason for the Incarnation. God, knowing that man was not
   by nature sufficient to know Him, gave him, in order that he might have
   some profit in being, a knowledge of Himself. He made them in the Image
   of the Word, that thus they might know the Word, and through Him the
   Father. Yet man, despising this, fell into idolatry, leaving the unseen
   God for magic and astrology; and all this in spite of God's manifold
   revelation of Himself.

   God, Who has the power over all things, when He was making the race of
   men through His own Word, seeing the weakness of their nature, that it
   was not sufficient of itself to know its Maker, nor to get any idea at
   all of God; because while He was uncreate, the creatures had been made
   of nought, and while He was incorporeal, men had been fashioned in a
   lower way in the body, and because in every way the things made fell
   far short of being able to comprehend and know their Maker--taking
   pity, I say, on the race of men, inasmuch as He is good, He did not
   leave them destitute of the knowledge of Himself, lest they should find
   no profit in existing at all [233] . 2. For what profit to the
   creatures if they knew not their Maker? or how could they be rational
   without knowing the Word (and Reason) of the Father, in Whom they
   received their very being? For there would be nothing to distinguish
   them even from brute creatures if they had knowledge of nothing but
   earthly things. Nay, why did God make them at all, as He did not wish
   to be known by them? 3. Whence, lest this should be so, being good, He
   gives them a share in His own Image, our Lord Jesus Christ, and makes
   them after His own Image and after His likeness: so that by such grace
   perceiving the Image, that is, the Word of the Father, they may be able
   through Him to get an idea of the Father, and knowing their Maker, live
   the happy and truly blessed life. 4. But men once more in their
   perversity having set at nought, in spite of all this, the grace given
   them, so wholly rejected God, and so darkened their soul, as not merely
   to forget their idea of God, but also to fashion for themselves one
   invention after another. For not only did they grave idols for
   themselves, instead of the truth, and honour things that were not
   before the living God, "and [234] serve the creature rather than the
   Creator," but, worst of all, they transferred the honour of God even to
   stocks and stones and to every material object and to men, and went
   even further than this, as we have said in the former treatise. 5. So
   far indeed did their impiety go, that they proceeded to worship devils,
   and proclaimed them as gods, fulfilling their own [235] lusts. For they
   performed, as was said above, offerings of brute animals, and
   sacrifices of men, as was meet for them [236] , binding themselves down
   all the faster under their maddening inspirations. 6. For this reason
   it was also that magic arts were taught among them, and oracles in
   divers places led men astray, and all men ascribed the influences of
   their birth and existence to the stars and to all the heavenly bodies,
   having no thought of anything beyond what was visible. 7. And, in a
   word, everything was full of irreligion and lawlessness, and God alone,
   and His Word, was unknown, albeit He had not hidden Himself out of
   men's sight, nor given the knowledge of Himself in one way only; but
   had, on the contrary, unfolded it to them in many forms and by many
   ways.

   Â§12. For though man was created in grace, God, foreseeing his
   forgetfulness, provided also the works of creation to remind man of
   him. Yet further, He ordained a Law and Prophets, whose ministry was
   meant for all the world. Yet men heeded only their own lusts.

   For whereas the grace of the Divine Image was in itself sufficient to
   make known God the Word, and through Him the Father; still God, knowing
   the weakness of men, made provision even for their carelessness: so
   that if they cared not to know God of themselves, they might be enabled
   through the works of creation to avoid ignorance of the Maker. 2. But
   since men's carelessness, by little and little, descends to lower
   things, God made provision, once more, even for this weakness of
   theirs, by sending a law, and prophets, men such as they knew, so that
   even if they were not ready to look up to heaven and know their
   Creator, they might have their instruction from those near at hand. For
   men are able to learn from men more directly about higher things. 3. So
   it was open to them, by looking into the height of heaven, and
   perceiving the harmony of creation, to know its Ruler, the Word of the
   Father, Who, by His own providence over all things makes known the
   Father to all, and to this end moves all things, that through Him all
   may know God. 4. Or, if this were too much for them, it was possible
   for them to meet at least the holy men, and through them to learn of
   God, the Maker of all things, the Father of Christ; and that the
   worship of idols is godlessness, and full of all impiety. 5. Or it was
   open to them, by knowing the law even, to cease from all lawlessness
   and live a virtuous life. For neither was the law for the Jews alone,
   nor were the Prophets sent for them only, but, though sent to the Jews
   and persecuted by the Jews, they were for all the world a holy school
   of the knowledge of God and the conduct of the soul. 6. God's goodness
   then and loving-kindness being so great--men nevertheless, overcome by
   the pleasures of the moment and by the illusions and deceits sent by
   demons, did not raise their heads toward the truth, but loaded
   themselves the more with evils and sins, so as no longer to seem
   rational, but from their ways to be reckoned void of reason.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§13. Here again, was God to keep silence? to allow to false gods the
   worship He made us to render to Himself? A king whose subjects had
   revolted would, after sending letters and messages, go to them in
   person. How much more shall God restore in us the grace of His image.
   This men, themselves but copies, could not do. Hence the Word Himself
   must come (1) to recreate, (2) to destroy death in the Body.

   So then, men having thus become brutalized, and demoniacal deceit thus
   clouding every place, and hiding the knowledge of the true God, what
   was God to do? To keep still silence at so great a thing, and suffer
   men to be led astray by demons and not to know God? 2. And what was the
   use of man having been originally made in God's image? For it had been
   better for him to have been made simply like a brute animal, than, once
   made rational, for him to live [237] the life of the brutes. 3. Or
   where was any necessity at all for his receiving the idea of God to
   begin with? For if he be not fit to receive it even now, it were better
   it had not been given him at first. 4. Or what profit to God Who has
   made them, or what glory to Him could it be, if men, made by Him, do
   not worship Him, but think that others are their makers? For God thus
   proves to have made these for others instead of for Himself. 5. Once
   again, a merely human king does not let the lands he has colonized pass
   to others to serve them, nor go over to other men; but he warns them by
   letters, and often sends to them by friends, or, if need be, he comes
   in person, to put them to rebuke in the last resort by his presence,
   only that they may not serve others and his own work be spent for
   naught. 6. Shall not God much more spare His own creatures, that they
   be not led astray from Him and serve things of nought? especially since
   such going astray proves the cause of their ruin and undoing, and since
   it was unfitting that they should perish which had once been partakers
   of God's image. 7. What then was God to do? or what was to be done save
   the renewing of that which was in God's image, so that by it men might
   once more be able to know Him? But how could this have come to pass
   save by the presence of the very Image of God, our Lord Jesus Christ?
   For by men's means it was impossible, since they are but made after an
   image; nor by angels either, for not even they are (God's) images.
   Whence the Word of God came in His own person, that, as He was the
   Image of the Father, He might be able to create afresh the man after
   the image. 8. But, again, it could not else have taken place had not
   death and corruption been done away. 9. Whence He took, in natural
   fitness, a mortal body, that while death might in it be once for all
   done away, men made after His Image might once more be renewed. None
   other then was sufficient for this need, save the Image of the Father.

   Â§14. A portrait once effaced must be restored from the original. Thus
   the Son of the Father came to seek, save, and regenerate. No other way
   was possible. Blinded himself, man could not see to heal. The witness
   of creation had failed to preserve him, and could not bring him back.
   The Word alone could do so. But how? Only by revealing Himself as Man.

   For as, when the likeness painted on a panel has been effaced by stains
   from without, he whose likeness it is must needs come once more to
   enable the portrait to be renewed on the same wood: for, for the sake
   of his picture, even the mere wood on which it is painted is not thrown
   away, but the outline is renewed upon it; 2. in the same way also the
   most holy Son of the Father, being the Image of the Father, came to our
   region to renew man once made in His likeness, and find him, as one
   lost, by the remission of sins; as He says Himself in the Gospels: "I
   came [238] to find and to save the lost." Whence He said to the Jews
   also: "Except [239] a man be born again," not meaning, as they thought,
   birth from woman, but speaking of the soul born and created anew in the
   likeness of God's image. 3. But since wild idolatry and godlessness
   occupied the world, and the knowledge of God was hid, whose part was it
   to teach the world concerning the Father? Man's, might one say? But it
   was not in man's power to penetrate everywhere beneath the sun; for
   neither had they the physical strength to run so far, nor would they be
   able to claim credence in this matter, nor were they sufficient by
   themselves to withstand the deceit and impositions of evil spirits. 4.
   For where all were smitten and confused in soul from demoniacal deceit,
   and the vanity of idols, how was it possible for them to win over man's
   soul and man's mind--whereas they cannot even see them? Or how can a
   man convert what he does not see? 5. But perhaps one might say creation
   was enough; but if creation were enough, these great evils would never
   have come to pass. For creation was there already, and all the same,
   men were grovelling in the same error concerning God. 6. Who, then, was
   needed, save the Word of God, that sees both soul and mind, and that
   gives movement to all things in creation, and by them makes known the
   Father? For He who by His own Providence and ordering of all things was
   teaching men concerning the Father, He it was that could renew this
   same teaching as well. 7. How, then, could this have been done? Perhaps
   one might say, that the same means were open as before, for Him to shew
   forth the truth about the Father once more by means of the work of
   creation. But this was no longer a sure means. Quite the contrary; for
   men missed seeing this before, and have turned their eyes no longer
   upward but downward. 8. Whence, naturally, willing to profit men, He
   sojourns here as man, taking to Himself a body like the others, and
   from things of earth, that is by the works of His body [He teaches
   them], so that they who would not know Him from His Providence and rule
   over all things, may even from the works done by His actual body know
   the Word of God which is in the body, and through Him the Father.

   Â§15. Thus the Word condescended to man's engrossment in corporeal
   things, by even taking a body. All man's superstitions He met halfway;
   whether men were inclined to worship Nature, Man, Demons, or the dead,
   He shewed Himself Lord of all these.

   For as a kind teacher who cares for His disciples, if some of them
   cannot profit by higher subjects, comes down to their level, and
   teaches them at any rate by simpler courses; so also did the Word of
   God. As Paul also says: "For seeing [240] that in the wisdom of God the
   world through its wisdom knew not God, it was God's good pleasure
   through the foolishness of the word preached to save them that
   believe." 2. For seeing that men, having rejected the contemplation of
   God, and with their eyes downward, as though sunk in the deep, were
   seeking about for God in nature and in the world of sense, feigning
   gods for themselves of mortal men and demons; to this end the loving
   and general Saviour of all, the Word of God, takes to Himself a body,
   and as Man walks among men and meets the senses of all men half-way
   [241] , to the end, I say, that they who think that God is corporeal
   may from what the Lord effects by His body perceive the truth, and
   through Him recognize [242] the Father. 3. So, men as they were, and
   human in all their thoughts, on whatever objects they fixed their
   senses, there they saw themselves met half-way [243] , and taught the
   truth from every side. 4. For if they looked with awe upon the
   Creation, yet they saw how she confessed Christ as Lord; or if their
   mind was swayed toward men, so as to think them gods, yet from the
   Saviour's works, supposing they compared them, the Saviour alone among
   men appeared Son of God; for there were no such works done among the
   rest as have been done by the Word of God. 5. Or if they were biassed
   toward evil spirits, even, yet seeing them cast out by the Word, they
   were to know that He alone, the Word of God, was God, and that the
   spirits were none. 6. Or if their mind had already sunk even to the
   dead, so as to worship heroes, and the gods spoken of in the poets,
   yet, seeing the Saviour's resurrection, they were to confess them to be
   false gods, and that the Lord alone is true, the Word of the Father,
   that was Lord even of death. 7. For this cause He was both born and
   appeared as Man, and died, and rose again, dulling and casting into the
   shade the works of all former men by His own, that in whatever
   direction the bias of men might be, from thence He might recall them,
   and teach them of His own true Father, as He Himself says: "I came to
   save and to find that which was lost [244] ."

   Â§16. He came then to attract man's sense-bound attention to Himself as
   man, and so to lead him on to know Him as God.

   For men's mind having finally fallen to things of sense, the Word
   disguised Himself by appearing in a body, that He might, as Man,
   transfer men to Himself, and centre their senses on Himself, and, men
   seeing Him thenceforth as Man, persuade them by the works He did that
   He is not Man only, but also God, and the Word and Wisdom of the true
   God. 2. This, too, is what Paul means to point out when he says: "That
   ye [245] being rooted and grounded in love, may be strong to apprehend
   with all the saints what is the breadth and length, and height and
   depth, and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye
   may be filled unto all the fulness of God." 3. For by the Word
   revealing Himself everywhere, both above and beneath, and in the depth
   and in the breadth--above, in the creation; beneath, in becoming man;
   in the depth, in Hades; and in the breadth, in the world--all things
   have been filled with the knowledge of God. 4. Now for this cause,
   also, He did not immediately upon His coming accomplish His sacrifice
   on behalf of all, by offering His body to death and raising it again,
   for by this [246] means He would have made Himself invisible. But He
   made Himself visible enough by what [247] He did, abiding in it, and
   doing such works, and shewing such signs, as made Him known no longer
   as Man, but as God the Word. 5. For by His becoming Man, the Saviour
   was to accomplish both works of love; first, in putting away death from
   us and renewing us again; secondly, being unseen and invisible, in
   manifesting and making Himself known by His works to be the Word of the
   Father, and the Ruler and King of the universe.

   Â§17. How the Incarnation did not limit the ubiquity of the Word, nor
   diminish His Purity. (Simile of the Sun.)

   For He was not, as might be imagined, circumscribed in the body, nor,
   while present in the body, was He absent elsewhere; nor, while He moved
   the body, was the universe left void of His working and Providence;
   but, thing most marvellous, Word as He was, so far from being contained
   by anything, He rather contained all things Himself; and just as while
   present in the whole of Creation, He is at once distinct in being from
   the universe, and present in all things by His own power,--giving order
   to all things, and over all and in all revealing His own providence,
   and giving life to each thing and all things, including the whole
   without being included, but being in His own Father alone wholly and in
   every respect,--2. thus, even while present in a human body and Himself
   quickening it, He was, without inconsistency, quickening the universe
   as well, and was in every process of nature, and was outside the whole,
   and while known from the body by His works, He was none the less
   manifest from the working of the universe as well. 3. Now, it is the
   function of soul to behold even what is outside its own body, by acts
   of thought, without, however, working outside its own body, or moving
   by its presence things remote from the body. Never, that is, does a
   man, by thinking of things at a distance, by that fact either move or
   displace them; nor if a man were to sit in his own house and reason
   about the heavenly bodies, would he by that fact either move the sun or
   make the heavens revolve. But he sees that they move and have their
   being, without being actually able to influence them. 4. Now, the Word
   of God in His man's nature was not like that; for He was not bound to
   His body, but rather was Himself wielding it, so that He was not only
   in it, but was actually in everything, and while external to the
   universe, abode in His Father only. 5. And this was the wonderful thing
   that He was at once walking as man, and as the Word was quickening all
   things, and as the Son was dwelling with His Father. So that not even
   when the Virgin bore Him did He suffer any change, nor by being in the
   body was [His glory] dulled: but, on the contrary, He sanctified the
   body also. 6. For not even by being in the universe does He share in
   its nature, but all things, on the contrary, are quickened and
   sustained by Him. 7. For if the sun too, which was made by Him, and
   which we see, as it revolves in the heaven, is not defiled [248] by
   touching the bodies upon earth, nor is it put out by darkness, but on
   the contrary itself illuminates and cleanses them also, much less was
   the all-holy Word of God, Maker and Lord also of the sun, defiled by
   being made known in the body; on the contrary, being incorruptible, He
   quickened and cleansed the body also, which was in itself mortal: "who
   [249] did," for so it says, "no sin, neither was guile found in His
   mouth."

   Â§18. How the Word and Power of God works in His human actions: by
   casting out devils, by Miracles, by His Birth of the Virgin.

   Accordingly, when inspired writers on this matter speak of Him as
   eating and being born, understand [250] that the body, as body, was
   born, and sustained with food corresponding to its nature, while God,
   the Word Himself, Who was united with the body, while ordering all
   things, also by the works He did in the body shewed Himself to be not
   man, but God the Word. But these things are said of Him, because the
   actual body which ate, was born, and suffered, belonged to none other
   but to the Lord: and because, having become man, it was proper for
   these things to be predicated of Him as man, to shew Him to have a body
   in truth, and not in seeming. 2. But just as from these things He was
   known to be bodily present, so from the works He did in the body He
   made Himself known to be Son of God. Whence also He cried to the
   unbelieving Jews; "If [251] I do not the works of My Father, believe Me
   not. But if I do them, though ye believe not Me, believe My works; that
   ye may know and understand that the Father is in Me, and I in the
   Father." 3. For just as, though invisible, He is known through the
   works of creation; so, having become man, and being in the body unseen,
   it may be known from His works that He Who can do these is not man, but
   the Power and Word of God. 4. For His charging evil spirits, and their
   being driven forth, this deed is not of man, but of God. Or who that
   saw Him healing the diseases to which the human race is subject, can
   still think Him man and not God? For He cleansed lepers, made lame men
   to walk, opened the hearing of deaf men, made blind men to see again,
   and in a word drove away from men all diseases and infirmities: from
   which acts it was possible even for the most ordinary observer to see
   His Godhead. For who that saw Him give back [252] what was deficient to
   men born lacking, and open the eyes of the man blind from his birth,
   would have failed to perceive that the nature of men was subject to
   Him, and that He was its Artificer and Maker? For He that gave back
   that which the man from his birth had not, must be, it is surely
   evident, the Lord also of men's natural birth. 5. Therefore, even to
   begin with, when He was descending to us, He fashioned His body for
   Himself from a Virgin, thus to afford to all no small proof of His
   Godhead, in that He Who formed this is also Maker of everything else as
   well. For who, seeing a body proceeding forth from a Virgin alone
   without man, can fail to infer that He Who appears in it is Maker and
   Lord of other bodies also? 6. Or who, seeing the substance of water
   changed and transformed into wine, fails to perceive that He Who did
   this is Lord and Creator of the substance of all waters? For to this
   end He went upon the sea also as its Master, and walked as on dry land,
   to afford evidence to them that saw it of His lordship over all things.
   And in feeding so vast a multitude on little, and of His own self
   yielding abundance where none was, so that from five loaves five
   thousand had enough, and left so much again over, did He shew Himself
   to be any other than the very Lord Whose Providence is over all things?

   Â§19. Man, unmoved by nature, was to be taught to know God by that
   sacred Manhood, Whose deity all nature confessed, especially in His
   Death.

   But all this it seemed well for the Saviour to do; that since men had
   failed to know His Providence, revealed in the Universe, and had failed
   to perceive His Godhead shewn in creation, they might at any rate from
   the works of His body recover their sight, and through Him receive an
   idea of the knowledge of the Father, inferring, as I said before, from
   particular cases His Providence over the whole. 2. For who that saw His
   power over evil spirits, or who that saw the evil spirits confess that
   He was their Lord, will hold his mind any longer in doubt whether this
   be the Son and Wisdom and Power of God? 3. For He made even the
   creation break silence: in that even at His death, marvellous to
   relate, or rather at His actual trophy over death--the Cross I
   mean--all creation was confessing that He that was made manifest and
   suffered in the body was not man merely, but the Son of God and Saviour
   of all. For the sun hid His face, and the earth quaked and the
   mountains were rent: all men were awed. Now these things shewed that
   Christ on the Cross was God, while all creation was His slave, and was
   witnessing by its fear to its Master's presence. Thus, then, God the
   Word shewed Himself to men by His works. But our next step must be to
   recount and speak of the end of His bodily life and course, and of the
   nature of the death of His body; especially as this is the sum of our
   faith, and all men without exception are full of it: so that you may
   know that no whit the less from this also Christ is known to be God and
   the Son of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§20. None, then, could bestow incorruption, but He Who had made, none
   restore the likeness of God, save His Own Image, none quicken, but the
   Life, none teach, but the Word. And He, to pay our debt of death, must
   also die for us, and rise again as our first-fruits from the grave.
   Mortal therefore His Body must be; corruptible, His Body could not be.

   We have, then, now stated in part, as far as it was possible, and as
   ourselves had been able to understand, the reason of His bodily
   appearing; that it was in the power of none other to turn the
   corruptible to incorruption, except the Saviour Himself, that had at
   the beginning also made all things out of nought and that none other
   could create anew the likeness of God's image for men, save the Image
   of the Father; and that none other could render the mortal immortal,
   save our Lord Jesus Christ, Who is the Very Life [253] ; and that none
   other could teach men of the Father, and destroy the worship of idols,
   save the Word, that orders all things and is alone the true
   Only-begotten Son of the Father. 2. But since it was necessary also
   that the debt owing from all should be paid again: for, as I have
   already said [254] , it was owing that all should die, for which
   especial cause, indeed, He came among us: to this intent, after the
   proofs of His Godhead from His works, He next offered up His sacrifice
   also on behalf of all, yielding His Temple to death in the stead of
   all, in order firstly to make men quit and free of their old trespass,
   and further to shew Himself more powerful even than death, displaying
   His own body incorruptible, as first-fruits of the resurrection of all.
   3. And do not be surprised if we frequently [255] repeat the same words
   on the same subject. For since we are speaking of the counsel of God,
   therefore we expound the same sense in more than one form, lest we
   should seem to be leaving anything out, and incur the charge of
   inadequate treatment: for it is better to submit to the blame of
   repetition than to leave out anything that ought to be set down. 4. The
   body, then, as sharing the same nature with all, for it was a human
   body, though by an unparalleled miracle it was formed of a virgin only,
   yet being mortal, was to die also, conformably to its peers. But by
   virtue of the union of the Word with it, it was no longer subject to
   corruption according to its own nature, but by reason of the Word that
   was come to dwell [256] in it it was placed out of the reach of
   corruption. 5. And so it was that two marvels came to pass at once,
   that the death of all was accomplished in the Lord's body, and that
   death and corruption were wholly done away by reason of the Word that
   was united with it. For there was need of death, and death must needs
   be suffered on behalf of all, that the debt owing from all might be
   paid. 6. Whence, as I said before, the Word, since it was not possible
   for Him to die, as He was immortal, took to Himself a body such as
   could die, that He might offer it as His own in the stead of all, and
   as suffering, through His union [257] with it, on behalf of all, "Bring
   [258] to nought Him that had the power of death, that is the devil; and
   might deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime
   subject to bondage."

   Â§21. Death brought to nought by the death of Christ. Why then did not
   Christ die privately, or in a more honourable way? He was not subject
   to natural death, but had to die at the hands of others. Why then did
   He die? Nay but for that purpose He came, and but for that, He could
   not have risen.

   Why, now that the common Saviour of all has died on our behalf, we, the
   faithful in Christ, no longer die the death as before, agreeably to the
   warning of the law; for this condemnation has ceased; but, corruption
   ceasing and being put away by the grace of the Resurrection, henceforth
   we are only dissolved, agreeably to our bodies' mortal nature, at the
   time God has fixed for each, that we may be able to gain a better
   resurrection. 2. For like the seeds which are cast into the earth, we
   do not perish by dissolution, but sown in the earth, shall rise again,
   death having been brought to nought by the grace of the Saviour. Hence
   it is that blessed Paul, who was made a surety of the Resurrection to
   all, says: "This corruptible [259] must put on incorruption, and this
   mortal must put on immortality; but when this corruptible shall have
   put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality,
   then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is
   swallowed up in victory. O death where is thy sting? O grave where is
   thy victory?" 3. Why, then, one might say, if it were necessary for Him
   to yield up His body to death in the stead of all, did He not lay it
   aside as man privately, instead of going as far as even to be
   crucified? For it were more fitting for Him to have laid His body aside
   honourably, than ignominiously to endure a death like this. 4. Now, see
   to it, I reply, whether such an objection be not merely human, whereas
   what the Saviour did is truly divine and for many reasons worthy of His
   Godhead. Firstly, because the death which befalls men comes to them
   agreeably to the weakness of their nature; for, unable to continue in
   one stay, they are dissolved with time. Hence, too, diseases befall
   them, and they fall sick and die. But the Lord is not weak, but is the
   Power of God and Word of God and Very Life. 5. If, then, He had laid
   aside His body somewhere in private, and upon a bed, after the manner
   of men, it would have been thought that He also did this agreeably to
   the weakness of His nature, and because there was nothing in him more
   than in other men. But since He was, firstly, the Life and the Word of
   God, and it was necessary, secondly, for the death on behalf of all to
   be accomplished, for this cause, on the one hand, because He was life
   and power, the body gained strength in Him; 6. while on the other, as
   death must needs come to pass, He did not Himself take, but received at
   others' hands; the occasion of perfecting His sacrifice. Since it was
   not fit, either, that the Lord should fall sick, who healed the
   diseases of others; nor again was it right for that body to lose its
   strength, in which He gives strength to the weaknesses of others also.
   7. Why, then, did He not prevent death, as He did sickness? Because it
   was for this that He had the body, and it was unfitting to prevent it,
   lest the Resurrection also should be hindered, while yet it was equally
   unfitting for sickness to precede His death, lest it should be thought
   weakness on the part of Him that was in the body. Did He not then
   hunger? Yes; He hungered, agreeably to the properties of His body. But
   He did not perish of hunger, because of the Lord that wore it. Hence,
   even if He died to ransom all, yet He saw not corruption. For [His
   body] rose again in perfect soundness, since the body belonged to none
   other, but to the very Life.

   Â§22. But why did He not withdraw His body from the Jews, and so guard
   its immortality? (1) It became Him not to inflict death on Himself, and
   yet not to shun it. (2) He came to receive death as the due of others,
   therefore it should come to Him from without. (3) His death must be
   certain, to guarantee the truth of His Resurrection. Also, He could not
   die from infirmity, lest He should be mocked in His healing of others.

   But it were better, one might say, to have hidden from the designs of
   the Jews, that He might guard His body altogether from death. Now let
   such an one be told that this too was unbefitting the Lord. For as it
   was not fitting for the Word of God, being the Life, to inflict death
   Himself on His own body, so neither was it suitable to fly from death
   offered by others, but rather to follow it up unto destruction, for
   which reason He naturally neither laid aside His body of His own
   accord, nor, again, fled from the Jews when they took counsel against
   Him. 2. But this did not shew weakness on the Word's part, but, on the
   contrary, shewed Him to be Saviour and Life; in that He both awaited
   death to destroy it, and hasted to accomplish the death offered Him for
   the salvation of all. 3. And besides, the Saviour came to accomplish
   not His own death, but the death of men; whence He did not lay aside
   His body by a death of His own [260] --for He was Life and had
   none--but received that death which came from men, in order perfectly
   to do away with this when it met Him in His own body. 4. Again, from
   the following also one might see the reasonableness of the Lord's body
   meeting this end. The Lord was especially concerned for the
   resurrection of the body which He was set to accomplish. For what He
   was to do was to manifest it as a monument of victory over death, and
   to assure all of His having effected the blotting out of corruption,
   and of the incorruption of their bodies from thenceforward; as a gage
   of which and a proof of the resurrection in store for all, He has
   preserved His own body incorrupt. 5. If, then, once more, His body had
   fallen sick, and the word had been sundered from it in the sight of
   all, it would have been unbecoming that He who healed the diseases of
   others should suffer His own instrument to waste in sickness. For how
   could His driving out the diseases of others have been believed [261]
   in if His own temple fell sick in Him [262] ? For either He had been
   mocked as unable to drive away diseases, or if He could, but did not,
   He would be thought insensible toward others also.

   Â§23. Necessity of a public death for the doctrine of the Resurrection.

   But even if, without any disease and without any pain, He had hidden
   His body away privily and by Himself "in [263] a corner," or in a
   desert place, or in a house, or anywhere, and afterwards suddenly
   appeared and said that He had been raised from the dead, He would have
   seemed on all hands to be telling idle tales [264] , and what He said
   about the Resurrection would have been all the more discredited, as
   there was no one at all to witness to His death. Now, death must
   precede resurrection, as it would be no resurrection did not death
   precede; so that if the death of His body had taken place anywhere in
   secret, the death not being apparent nor taking place before witnesses,
   His Resurrection too had been hidden and without evidence. 2. Or why,
   while when He had risen He proclaimed the Resurrection, should He cause
   His death to take place in secret? or why, while He drove out evil
   spirits in the presence of all, and made the man blind from his birth
   recover his sight, and changed the water into wine, that by these means
   He might be believed to be the Word of God, should He not manifest His
   mortal nature as incorruptible in the presence of all, that He might be
   believed Himself to be the Life? 3. Or how were His disciples to have
   boldness in speaking of the Resurrection, were they not able to say
   that He first died? Or how could they be believed, saying that death
   had first taken place and then the Resurrection, had they not had as
   witnesses of His death the men before whom they spoke with boldness?
   For if, even as it was, when His death and Resurrection had taken place
   in the sight of all, the Pharisees of that day would not believe, but
   compelled even those who had seen the Resurrection to deny it, why,
   surely, if these things had happened in secret, how many pretexts for
   disbelief would they have devised? 4. Or how could the end of death,
   and the victory over it be proved, unless challenging it before the
   eyes of all He had shewn it to be dead, annulled for the future by the
   incorruption of His body?

   Â§24. Further objections anticipated. He did not choose His manner of
   death; for He was to prove Conqueror of death in all or any of its
   forms: (simile of a good wrestler). The death chosen to disgrace Him
   proved the Trophy against death: moreover it preserved His body
   undivided.

   But what others also might have said, we must anticipate in reply. For
   perhaps a man might say even as follows: If it was necessary for His
   death to take place before all, and with witnesses, that the story of
   His Resurrection also might be believed, it would have been better at
   any rate for Him to have devised for Himself a glorious death, if only
   to escape the ignominy of the Cross. 2. But had He done even this, He
   would give ground for suspicion against Himself, that He was not
   powerful against every death, but only against the death devised for
   [265] Him; and so again there would have been a pretext for disbelief
   about the Resurrection all the same. So death came to His body, not
   from Himself, but from hostile counsels, in order that whatever death
   they offered to the Saviour, this He might utterly do away. 3. And just
   as a noble wrestler, great in skill and courage, does not pick out his
   antagonists for himself, lest he should raise a suspicion of his being
   afraid of some of them, but puts it in the choice of the onlookers, and
   especially so if they happen to be his enemies, so that against
   whomsoever they match him, him he may throw, and be believed superior
   to them all; so also the Life of all, our Lord and Saviour, even
   Christ, did not devise a death for His own body, so as not to appear to
   be fearing some other death; but He accepted on the Cross, and endured,
   a death inflicted by others, and above all by His enemies, which they
   thought dreadful and ignominious and not to be faced; so that this also
   being destroyed, both He Himself might be believed to be the Life, and
   the power of death be brought utterly to nought. 4. So something
   surprising and startling has happened; for the death, which they
   thought to inflict as a disgrace, was actually a monument of victory
   against death itself. Whence neither did He suffer the death of John,
   his head being severed, nor, as Esaias, was He sawn in sunder; in order
   that even in death He might still keep His body undivided and in
   perfect soundness, and no pretext be afforded to those that would
   divide the Church.

   Â§25. Why the Cross, of all deaths? (1) He had to bear the curse for us.
   (2) On it He held out His hands to unite all, Jews and Gentiles, in
   Himself. (3) He defeated the "Prince of the powers of the air" in His
   own region, clearing the way to heaven and opening for us the
   everlasting doors.

   And thus much in reply to those without who pile up arguments for
   themselves. But if any of our own people also inquire, not from love of
   debate, but from love of learning, why He suffered death in none other
   way save on the Cross, let him also be told that no other way than this
   was good for us, and that it was well that the Lord suffered this for
   our sakes. 2. For if He came Himself to bear the curse laid upon us,
   how else could He have "become [266] a curse," unless He received the
   death set for a curse? and that is the Cross. For this is exactly what
   is written: "Cursed [267] is he that hangeth on a tree." 3. Again, if
   the Lord's death is the ransom of all, and by His death "the middle
   [268] wall of partition" is broken down, and the calling of the nations
   is brought about, how would He have called us to Him, had He not been
   crucified? For it is only on the cross that a man dies with his hands
   spread out. Whence it was fitting for the Lord to bear this also and to
   spread out His hands, that with the one He might draw the ancient
   people, and with the other those from the Gentiles, and unite both in
   Himself. 4. For this is what He Himself has said, signifying by what
   manner of death He was to ransom all: "I, when [269] I am lifted up,"
   He saith, "shall draw all men unto Me." 5. And once more, if the devil,
   the enemy of our race, having fallen from heaven, wanders about our
   lower atmosphere, and there bearing rule over his fellow-spirits, as
   his peers in disobedience, not only works illusions by their means in
   them that are deceived, but tries to hinder them that are going up (and
   about this [270] the Apostle says: "According to the prince of the
   power of the air, of the spirit that now worketh in the sons of
   disobedience"); while the Lord came to cast down the devil, and clear
   the air and prepare the way for us up into heaven, as said the Apostle:
   "Through [271] the veil, that is to say, His flesh"--and this must
   needs be by death--well, by what other kind of death could this have
   come to pass, than by one which took place in the air, I mean the
   cross? for only he that is perfected on the cross dies in the air.
   Whence it was quite fitting that the Lord suffered this death. 6. For
   thus being lifted up He cleared the air [272] of the malignity both of
   the devil and of demons of all kinds, as He says: "I beheld [273] Satan
   as lightning fall from heaven;" and made a new opening of the way up
   into heaven as He says once more: "Lift [274] up your gates, O ye
   princes, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors." For it was not the
   Word Himself that needed an opening of the gates, being Lord of all;
   nor were any of His works closed to their Maker; but we it was that
   needed it whom He carried up by His own body. For as He offered it to
   death on behalf of all, so by it He once more made ready the way up
   into the heavens.

   Â§26. Reasons for His rising on the Third Day. (1) Not sooner for else
   His real death would be denied, nor (2) later; to (a) guard the
   identity of His body, (b) not to keep His disciples too long in
   suspense, nor (c) to wait till the witnesses of His death were
   dispersed, or its memory faded.

   The death on the Cross, then, for us has proved seemly and fitting, and
   its cause has been shewn to be reasonable in every respect; and it may
   justly be argued that in no other way than by the Cross was it right
   for the salvation of all to take place. For not even thus--not even on
   the Cross--did He leave Himself concealed; but far otherwise, while He
   made creation witness to the presence of its Maker, He suffered not the
   temple of His body to remain long, but having merely shewn it to be
   dead, by the contact of death with it, He straightway raised it up on
   the third day, bearing away, as the mark of victory and the triumph
   over death, the incorruptibility and impassibility which resulted to
   His body. 2. For He could, even immediately on death, have raised His
   body and shewn it alive; but this also the Saviour, in wise foresight,
   did not do. For one might have said that He had not died at all, or
   that death had not come into perfect contact with Him, if He had
   manifested the Resurrection at once. 3. Perhaps, again, had the
   interval of His dying and rising again been one of two days [275] only,
   the glory of His incorruption would have been obscure. So in order that
   the body might be proved to be dead, the Word tarried yet one
   intermediate day, and on the third shewed it incorruptible to all. 4.
   So then, that the death on the Cross might be proved, He raised His
   body on the third day. 5. But lest, by raising it up when it had
   remained a long time and been completely corrupted, He should be
   disbelieved, as though He had exchanged it for some other body--for a
   man might also from lapse of time distrust what he saw, and forget what
   had taken place--for this cause He waited not more than three days; nor
   did He keep long in suspense those whom He had told about the
   Resurrection: 6. but while the word was still echoing in their ears and
   their eyes were still expectant and their mind in suspense, and while
   those who had slain Him were still living on earth, and were on the
   spot and could witness to the death of the Lord's body, the Son of God
   Himself, after an interval of three days, shewed His body, once dead,
   immortal and incorruptible; and it was made manifest to all that it was
   not from any natural weakness of the Word that dwelt in it that the
   body had died, but in order that in it death might be done away by the
   power of the Saviour.

   Â§27. The change wrought by the Cross in the relation of Death to Man.

   For that death is destroyed, and that the Cross is become the victory
   over it, and that it has no more power but is verily dead, this is no
   small proof, or rather an evident warrant, that it is despised by all
   Christ's disciples, and that they all take the aggressive against it
   and no longer fear it; but by the sign of the Cross and by faith in
   Christ tread it down as dead. 2. For of old, before the divine sojourn
   of the Saviour took place, even to the saints death was terrible [276]
   , and all wept for the dead as though they perished. But now that the
   Saviour has raised His body, death is no longer terrible; for all who
   believe in Christ tread him under as nought, and choose rather to die
   than to deny their faith in Christ. For they verily know that when they
   die they are not destroyed, but actually [begin to] live, and become
   incorruptible through the Resurrection. 3. And that devil that once
   maliciously exulted in death, now that its [277] pains were loosed,
   remained the only one truly dead. And a proof of this is, that before
   men believe Christ, they see in death an object of terror, and play the
   coward before him. But when they are gone over to Christ's faith and
   teaching, their contempt for death is so great that they even eagerly
   rush upon it, and become witnesses for the Resurrection the Saviour has
   accomplished against it. For while still tender in years they make
   haste to die, and not men only, but women also, exercise themselves by
   bodily discipline against it. So weak has he become, that even women
   who were formerly deceived by him, now mock at him as dead and
   paralyzed. 4. For as when a tyrant has been defeated by a real king,
   and bound hand and foot, then all that pass by laugh him to scorn,
   buffeting and reviling him, no longer fearing his fury and barbarity,
   because of the king who has conquered him; so also, death having been
   conquered and exposed by the Saviour on the Cross, and bound hand and
   foot, all they who are in Christ, as they pass by, trample on him, and
   witnessing to Christ scoff at death, jesting at him, and saying what
   has been written against him of old: "O death [278] , where is thy
   victory? O grave, where is thy sting."

     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§28. This exceptional fact must be tested by experience. Let those who
   doubt it become Christians.

   Is this, then, a slight proof of the weakness of death? or is it a
   slight demonstration of the victory won over him by the Saviour, when
   the youths and young maidens that are in Christ despise this life and
   practise to die? 2. For man is by nature afraid of death and of the
   dissolution of the body; but there is this most startling fact, that he
   who has put on the faith of the Cross despises even what is naturally
   fearful, and for Christ's sake is not afraid of death. 3. And just as,
   whereas fire has the natural property of burning, if some one said
   there was a substance which did not fear its burning, but on the
   contrary proved it weak--as the asbestos among the Indians is said to
   do--then one who did not believe the story, if he wished to put it to
   the test, is at any rate, after putting on the fireproof material and
   touching the fire, thereupon assured of the weakness attributed [279]
   to the fire: 4. or if any one wished to see the tyrant bound, at any
   rate by going into the country and domain of his conqueror he may see
   the man, a terror to others, reduced to weakness; so if a man is
   incredulous even still after so many proofs and after so many who have
   become martyrs in Christ, and after the scorn shewn for death every day
   by those who are illustrious in Christ, still, if his mind be even yet
   doubtful as to whether death has been brought to nought and had an end,
   he does well to wonder at so great a thing, only let him not prove
   obstinate in incredulity, nor case-hardened in the face of what is so
   plain. 5. But just as he who has got the asbestos knows that fire has
   no burning power over it, and as he who would see the tyrant bound goes
   over to the empire of his conqueror, so too let him who is incredulous
   about the victory over death receive the faith of Christ, and pass over
   to His teaching, and he shall see the weakness of death, and the
   triumph over it. For many who were formerly incredulous and scoffers
   have afterwards believed and so despised death as even to become
   martyrs for Christ Himself.

   against the asbestos' is based on a needless conjecture.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§29. Here then are wonderful effects, and a sufficient cause, the
   Cross, to account for them, as sunrise accounts for daylight.

   Now if by the sign of the Cross, and by faith in Christ, death is
   trampled down, it must be evident before the tribunal of truth that it
   is none other than Christ Himself that has displayed trophies and
   triumphs over death, and made him lose all his strength. 2. And if,
   while previously death was strong, and for that reason terrible, now
   after the sojourn of the Saviour and the death and Resurrection of His
   body it is despised, it must be evident that death has been brought to
   nought and conquered by the very Christ that ascended the Cross. 3. For
   as, if after night-time the sun rises, and the whole region of earth is
   illumined by him, it is at any rate not open to doubt that it is the
   sun who has revealed his light everywhere, that has also driven away
   the dark and given light to all things; so, now that death has come
   into contempt, and been trodden under foot, from the time when the
   Saviour's saving manifestation in the flesh and His death on the Cross
   took place, it must be quite plain that it is the very Saviour that
   also appeared in the body, Who has brought death to nought, and Who
   displays the signs of victory over him day by day in His own disciples.
   4. For when one sees men, weak by nature, leaping forward to death, and
   not fearing its corruption nor frightened of the descent into Hades,
   but with eager soul challenging it; and not flinching from torture, but
   on the contrary, for Christ's sake electing to rush upon death in
   preference to life upon earth, or even if one be an eye-witness of men
   and females and young children rushing and leaping upon death for the
   sake of Christ's religion; who is so silly, or who is so incredulous,
   or who so maimed in his mind, as not to see and infer that Christ, to
   Whom the people witness, Himself supplies and gives to each the victory
   over death, depriving him of all his power in each one of them that
   hold His faith and bear the sign of the Cross. 5. For he that sees the
   serpent trodden under foot, especially knowing his former fierceness no
   longer doubts that he is dead and has quite lost his strength, unless
   he is perverted in mind and has not even his bodily senses sound. For
   who that sees a lion, either, made sport of by children, fails to see
   that he is either dead or has lost all his power? 6. Just as, then, it
   is possible to see with the eyes the truth of all this, so, now that
   death is made sport of and despised by believers in Christ let none any
   longer doubt, nor any prove incredulous, of death having been brought
   to nought by Christ, and the corruption of death destroyed and stayed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§30. The reality of the resurrection proved by facts: (1) the victory
   over death described above: (2) the Wonders of Grace are the work of
   One Living, of One who is God: (3) if the gods be (as alleged) real and
   living, a fortiori He Who shatters their power is alive.

   What we have so far said, then, is no small proof that death has been
   brought to naught, and that the Cross of the Lord is a sign of victory
   over him. But of the Resurrection of the body to immortality thereupon
   accomplished by Christ, the common Saviour and true Life of all, the
   demonstration by facts is clearer than arguments to those whose mental
   vision is sound. 2. For if, as our argument shewed, death has been
   brought to nought, and because of Christ all tread him under foot, much
   more did He Himself first tread him down with His own body, and bring
   him to nought. But supposing death slain by Him, what could have
   happened save the rising again of His body, and its being displayed as
   a monument of victory against death? or how could death have been shewn
   to be brought to nought unless the Lord's body had risen? But if this
   demonstration of the Resurrection seem to any one insufficient, let him
   be assured of what is said even from what takes place before his eyes.
   3. For whereas on a man's decease he can put forth no power, but his
   influence lasts to the grave and thenceforth ceases; and actions, and
   power over men, belong to the living only; let him who will, see and be
   judge, confessing the truth from what appears to sight. 4. For now that
   the Saviour works so great things among men, and day by day is
   invisibly persuading so great a multitude from every side, both from
   them that dwell in Greece and in foreign lands, to come over to His
   faith, and all to obey His teaching, will any one still hold his mind
   in doubt whether a Resurrection has been accomplished by the Saviour,
   and whether Christ is alive, or rather is Himself the Life? 5. Or is it
   like a dead man to be pricking the consciences of men, so that they
   deny their hereditary laws and bow before the teaching of Christ? Or
   how, if he is no longer active (for this is proper to one dead), does
   he stay from their activity those who are active and alive, so that the
   adulterer no longer commits adultery, and the murderer murders no more,
   nor is the inflicter of wrong any longer grasping, and the profane is
   henceforth religious? Or how, if He be not risen but is dead, does He
   drive away, and pursue, and cast down those false gods said by the
   unbelievers to be alive, and the demons they worship? 6. For where
   Christ is named, and His faith, there all idolatry is deposed and all
   imposture of evil spirits is exposed, and any spirit is unable to
   endure even the name, nay even on barely hearing it flies and
   disappears. But this work is not that of one dead, but of one that
   lives--and especially of God. 7. In particular, it would be ridiculous
   to say that while the spirits cast out by Him and the idols brought to
   nought are alive, He who chases them away, and by His power prevents
   their even appearing, yea, and is being confessed by them all to be Son
   of God, is dead.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§31. If Power is the sign of life, what do we learn from the impotence
   of idols, for good or evil, and the constraining power of Christ and of
   the Sign of the Cross? Death and the demons are by this proved to have
   lost their sovereignty. Coincidence of the above argument from facts
   with that from the Personality of Christ.

   But they who disbelieve in the Resurrection afford a strong proof
   against themselves, if instead of all the spirits and the gods
   worshipped by them casting out Christ, Who, they say, is dead, Christ
   on the contrary proves them all to be dead. 2. For if it be true that
   one dead can exert no power, while the Saviour does daily so many
   works, drawing men to religion, persuading to virtue, teaching of
   immortality, leading on to a desire for heavenly things, revealing the
   knowledge of the Father, inspiring strength to meet death, shewing
   Himself to each one, and displacing the godlessness of idolatry, and
   the gods and spirits of the unbelievers can do none of these things,
   but rather shew themselves dead at the presence of Christ, their pomp
   being reduced to impotence and vanity; whereas by the sign of the Cross
   all magic is stopped, and all witchcraft brought to nought, and all the
   idols are being deserted and left, and every unruly pleasure is
   checked, and every one is looking up from earth to heaven: Whom is one
   to pronounce dead? Christ, that is doing so many works? But to work is
   not proper to one dead. Or him that exerts no power at all, but lies as
   it were without life? which is essentially proper to the idols and
   spirits, dead as they are. 3. For the Son of God is [280] "living and
   active," and works day by day, and brings about the salvation of all.
   But death is daily proved to have lost all his power, and idols and
   spirits are proved to be dead rather than Christ, so that henceforth no
   man can any longer doubt of the Resurrection of His body. 4. But he who
   is incredulous of the Resurrection of the Lord's body would seem to be
   ignorant of the power of the Word and Wisdom of God. For if He took a
   body to Himself at all, and--in reasonable consistency, as our argument
   shewed-- appropriated it as His own, what was the Lord to do with it?
   or what should be the end of the body when the Word had once descended
   upon it? For it could not but die, inasmuch as it was mortal, and to be
   offered unto death on behalf of all: for which purpose it was that the
   Saviour fashioned it for Himself. But it was impossible for it to
   remain dead, because it had been made the temple of life. Whence, while
   it died as mortal, it came to life again by reason of the Life in it;
   and of its Resurrection the works are a sign.

   Â§32. But who is to see Him risen, so as to believe? Nay, God is ever
   invisible and known by His works only: and here the works cry out in
   proof. If you do not believe, look at those who do, and perceive the
   Godhead of Christ. The demons see this, though men be blind. Summary of
   the argument so far.

   But if, because He is not seen, His having risen at all is disbelieved,
   it is high time for those who refuse belief to deny the very course of
   Nature. For it is God's peculiar property at once to be invisible and
   yet to be known from His works, as has been already stated above. 2.
   If, then, the works are not there, they do well to disbelieve what does
   not appear. But if the works cry aloud and shew it clearly, why do they
   choose to deny the life so manifestly due to the Resurrection? For even
   if they be maimed in their intelligence, yet even with the external
   senses men may see the unimpeachable power and Godhead of Christ. 3.
   For even a blind man, if he see not the sun, yet if he but take hold of
   the warmth the sun gives out, knows that there is a sun above the
   earth. Thus let our opponents also, even if they believe not as yet,
   being still blind to the truth, yet at least knowing His power by
   others who believe, not deny the Godhead of Christ and the Resurrection
   accomplished by Him. 4. For it is plain that if Christ be dead, He
   could not be expelling demons and spoiling idols; for a dead man the
   spirits would not have obeyed. But if they be manifestly expelled by
   the naming of His name, it must be evident that He is not dead;
   especially as spirits, seeing even what is unseen by men, could tell if
   Christ were dead and refuse Him any obedience at all. 5. But as it is,
   what irreligious men believe not, the spirits see--that He is God,--and
   hence they fly and fall at His feet, saying just what they uttered when
   He was in the body: "We [281] know Thee Who Thou art, the Holy One of
   God;" and, "Ah, what have we to do with Thee, Thou Son of God? I pray
   Thee, torment me not." 6. As then demons confess Him, and His works
   bear Him witness day by day, it must be evident, and let none brazen it
   out against the truth, both that the Saviour raised His own body, and
   that He is the true Son of God, being from Him, as from His Father, His
   own Word, and Wisdom, and Power, Who in ages later took a body for the
   salvation of all, and taught the world concerning the Father, and
   brought death to nought, and bestowed incorruption upon all by the
   promise of the Resurrection, having raised His own body as a
   first-fruits of this, and having displayed it by the sign of the Cross
   as a monument of victory over death and its corruption.

   Â§33. Unbelief of Jews and scoffing of Greeks. The former confounded by
   their own Scriptures. Prophecies of His coming as God and as Man.

   These things being so, and the Resurrection of His body and the victory
   gained over death by the Saviour being clearly proved, come now let us
   put to rebuke both the disbelief of the Jews and the scoffing of the
   Gentiles. 2. For these, perhaps, are the points where Jews express
   incredulity, while Gentiles laugh, finding fault with the unseemliness
   of the Cross, and of the Word of God becoming man. But our argument
   shall not delay to grapple with both especially as the proofs at our
   command against them are clear as day. 3. For Jews in their incredulity
   may be refuted from the Scriptures, which even themselves read; for
   this text and that, and, in a word, the whole inspired Scripture, cries
   aloud concerning these things, as even its express words abundantly
   shew. For prophets proclaimed beforehand concerning the wonder of the
   Virgin and the birth from her, saying: "Lo, the [282] Virgin shall be
   with child, and shall bring forth a Son, and they shall call his name
   Emmanuel, which is, being interpreted, God with us." 4. But Moses, the
   truly great, and whom they believe to speak truth, with reference to
   the Saviour's becoming man, having estimated what was said as
   important, and assured of its truth, set it down in these words: "There
   [283] shall rise a star out of Jacob, and a man out of Israel, and he
   shall break in pieces the captains of Moab." And again: "How lovely are
   thy habitations O Jacob, thy tabernacles O Israel, as shadowing
   gardens, and as parks by the rivers, and as tabernacles which the Lord
   hath fixed, as cedars by the waters. A man shall come forth out of his
   seed, and shall be Lord over many peoples." And again, Esaias: "Before
   [284] the Child know how to call father or mother, he shall take the
   power of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria before the king of
   Assyria." 5. That a man, then, shall appear is foretold in those words.
   But that He that is to come is Lord of all, they predict once more as
   follows: "Behold [285] the Lord sitteth upon a light cloud, and shall
   come into Egypt, and the graven images of Egypt shall be shaken." For
   from thence also it is that the Father calls Him back, saying: "I
   called [286] My Son out of Egypt."

   Â§34. Prophecies of His passion and death in all its circumstances.

   Nor is even His death passed over in silence: on the contrary, it is
   referred to in the divine Scriptures, even exceeding clearly. For to
   the end that none should err for want of instruction in the actual
   events, they feared not to mention even the cause of His death,--that
   He suffers it not for His own sake, but for the immortality and
   salvation of all, and the counsels of the Jews against Him and the
   indignities offered Him at their hands. 2. They say then: "A man [287]
   in stripes, and knowing how to bear weakness, for his face is turned
   away: he was dishonoured and held in no account. He beareth our sins,
   and is in pain on our account; and we reckoned him to be in labour, and
   in stripes, and in ill-usage; but he was wounded for our sins, and made
   weak for our wickedness. The chastisement of our peace was upon him,
   and by his stripes we were healed." O marvel at the loving-kindness of
   the Word, that for our sakes He is dishonoured, that we may be brought
   to honour. "For all we," it says, "like sheep were gone astray; man had
   erred in his way; and the Lord delivered him for our sins; and he
   openeth not his mouth, because he hath been evilly entreated. As a
   sheep was he brought to the slaughter, and as a lamb dumb before his
   shearer, so openeth he not his mouth: in his abasement his judgment was
   taken away [288] ." 3. Then lest any should from His suffering conceive
   Him to be a common man, Holy Writ anticipates the surmises of man, and
   declares the power (which worked) for Him [289] , and the difference of
   His nature compared with ourselves, saying: "But who shall declare his
   generation? For his life is taken away [290] from the earth. From the
   wickedness of the people was he brought to death. And I will give the
   wicked instead of his burial, and the rich instead of his death; for he
   did no wickedness, neither was guile found in his mouth. And the Lord
   will cleanse him from his stripes."

   suggestion that autou stood after huperaulon, and that the similarity
   of the five letters in ms. caused the second word to be dropped out.

   Â§35. Prophecies of the Cross. How these prophecies are satisfied in
   Christ alone.

   But, perhaps, having heard the prophecy of His death, you ask to learn
   also what is set forth concerning the Cross. For not even this is
   passed over: it is displayed by the holy men with great plainness. 2.
   For first Moses predicts it, and that with a loud voice, when he says:
   "Ye shall see [291] your Life hanging before your eyes, and shall not
   believe." 3. And next, the prophets after him witness of this, saying:
   "But [292] I as an innocent lamb brought to be slain, knew it not; they
   counselled an evil counsel against me, saying, Hither and let us cast a
   tree upon his [293] bread, and efface him from the land of the living."
   4. And again: "They pierced [294] my hands and my feet, they numbered
   all my bones, they parted my garments among them, and for my vesture
   they cast lots." 5. Now a death raised aloft and that takes place on a
   tree, could be none other than the Cross: and again, in no other death
   are the hands and feet pierced, save on the Cross only. 6. But since by
   the sojourn of the Saviour among men all nations also on every side
   began to know God; they did not leave this point, either, without a
   reference: but mention is made of this matter as well in the Holy
   Scriptures. For "there [295] shall be," he saith, "the root of Jesse,
   and he that riseth to rule the nations, on him shall the nations hope."
   This then is a little in proof of what has happened. 7. But all
   Scripture teems with refutations of the disbelief of the Jews. For
   which of the righteous men and holy prophets, and patriarchs, recorded
   in the divine Scriptures, ever had his corporal birth of a virgin only?
   Or what woman has sufficed without man for the conception of human
   kind? Was not Abel born of Adam, Enoch of Jared, Noe of Lamech, and
   Abraham of Tharra, Isaac of Abraham, Jacob of Isaac? Was not Judas born
   of Jacob, and Moses and Aaron of Ameram? Was not Samuel born of Elkana,
   was not David of Jesse, was not Solomon of David, was not Ezechias of
   Achaz, was not Josias of Amos, was not Esaias of Amos, was not Jeremy
   of Chelchias, was not Ezechiel of Buzi? Had not each a father as author
   of his existence? Who then is he that is born of a virgin only? For the
   prophet made exceeding much of this sign. 8. Or whose birth did a star
   in the skies forerun, to announce to the world him that was born? For
   when Moses was born, he was hid by his parents: David was not heard of,
   even by those of his neighbourhood, inasmuch as even the great Samuel
   knew him not, but asked, had Jesse yet another son? Abraham again
   became known to his neighbours as [296] a great man only subsequently
   to his birth. But of Christ's birth the witness was not man, but a star
   in that heaven whence He was descending.

   Â§36. Prophecies of Christ's sovereignty, flight into Egypt, &c.

   But what king that ever was, before he had strength to call father or
   mother, reigned and gained triumphs over his enemies [297] ? Did not
   David come to the throne at thirty years of age, and Solomon, when he
   had grown to be a young man? Did not Joas enter on the kingdom when
   seven years old, and Josias, a still later king, receive the government
   about the seventh year of his age? And yet they at that age had
   strength to call father or mother. 2. Who, then, is there that was
   reigning and spoiling his enemies almost before his birth? Or what king
   of this sort has ever been in Israel and in Juda--let the Jews, who
   have searched out the matter, tell us--in whom all the nations have
   placed their hopes and had peace, instead of being at enmity with them
   on every side? 3. For as long as Jerusalem stood there was war without
   respite betwixt them, and they all fought with Israel; the Assyrians
   oppressed them, the Egyptians persecuted them, the Babylonians fell
   upon them; and, strange to say, they had even the Syrians their
   neighbours at war against them. Or did not David war against them of
   Moab, and smite the Syrians, Josias guard against his neighbours, and
   Ezechias quail at the boasting of Senacherim, and Amalek make war
   against Moses, and the Amorites oppose him, and the inhabitants of
   Jericho array themselves against Jesus son of Naue? And, in a word,
   treaties of friendship had no place between the nations and Israel.
   Who, then, it is on whom the nations are to set their hope, it is worth
   while to see. For there must be such an one, as it is impossible for
   the prophet to have spoken falsely. 4. But which of the holy prophets
   or of the early patriarchs has died on the Cross for the salvation of
   all? Or who was wounded and destroyed for the healing of all? Or which
   of the righteous men, or kings, went down to Egypt, so that at his
   coming the idols of Egypt fell [298] ? For Abraham went thither, but
   idolatry prevailed universally all the same. Moses was born there, and
   the deluded worship of the people was there none the less.

   Â§37. Psalm xxii. 16, &c. Majesty of His birth and death. Confusion of
   oracles and demons in Egypt.

   Or who among those recorded in Scripture was pierced in the hands and
   feet, or hung at all upon a tree, and was sacrificed on a cross for the
   salvation of all? For Abraham died, ending his life on a bed; Isaac and
   Jacob also died with their feet raised on a bed; Moses and Aaron died
   on the mountain; David in his house, without being the object of any
   conspiracy at the hands of the people; true, he was pursued by Saul,
   but he was preserved unhurt. Esaias was sawn asunder, but not hung on a
   tree. Jeremy was shamefully treated, but did not die under
   condemnation; Ezechie suffered, not however for the people, but to
   indicate what was to come upon the people. 2. Again, these, even where
   they suffered, were men resembling all in their common nature; but he
   that is declared in Scripture to suffer on behalf of all is called not
   merely man, but the Life of all, albeit He was in fact like men in
   nature. For "ye shall [299] see," it says, "your Life hanging before
   your eyes;" and "who shall declare his generation?" For one can
   ascertain the genealogy of all the saints, and declare it from the
   beginning, and of whom each was born; but the generation of Him that is
   the Life the Scriptures refer to as not to be declared. 3. Who then is
   he of whom the Divine Scriptures say this? Or who is so great that even
   the prophets predict of him such great things? None else, now, is found
   in the Scriptures but the common Saviour of all, the Word of God, our
   Lord Jesus Christ. For He it is that proceeded from a virgin and
   appeared as man on the earth, and whose generation after the flesh
   cannot be declared. For there is none that can tell His father after
   the flesh, His body not being of a man, but of a virgin alone; 4. so
   that no one can declare the corporal generation of the Saviour from a
   man, in the same way as one can draw up a genealogy of David and of
   Moses and of all the patriarchs. For He it is that caused the star also
   to mark the birth of His body; since it was fit that the Word, coming
   down from heaven, should have His constellation also from heaven, and
   it was fitting that the King of Creation when He came forth should be
   openly recognized by all creation. 5. Why, He was born in JudÃ¦a, and
   men from Persia came to worship Him. He it is that even before His
   appearing in the body won the victory over His demon adversaries and a
   triumph over idolatry. All heathen at any rate from every region,
   abjuring their hereditary tradition and the impiety of idols, are now
   placing their hope in Christ, and enrolling themselves under Him, the
   like of which you may see with your own eyes. 6. For at no other time
   has the impiety of the Egyptians ceased, save when the Lord of all,
   riding as it were upon a cloud, came down there in the body and brought
   to nought the delusion of idols, and brought over all to Himself, and
   through Himself to the Father. 7. He it is that was crucified before
   the sun and all creation as witnesses, and before those who put Him to
   death: and by His death has salvation come to all, and all creation
   been ransomed. He is the Life of all, and He it is that as a sheep
   yielded His body to death as a substitute, for the salvation of all,
   even though the Jews believe it not.

   Â§38. Other clear prophecies of the coming of God in the flesh. Christ's
   miracles unprecedented.

   For if they do not think these proofs sufficient, let them be persuaded
   at any rate by other reasons, drawn from the oracles they themselves
   possess. For of whom do the prophets say: "I was [300] made manifest to
   them that sought me not, I was found of them that asked not for me: I
   said Behold, here am I, to the nation that had not called upon my name;
   I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people." 2.
   Who, then, one might say to the Jews, is he that was made manifest? For
   if it is the prophet, let them say when he was hid, afterward to appear
   again. And what manner of prophet is this, that was not only made
   manifest from obscurity, but also stretched out his hands on the Cross?
   None surely of the righteous, save the Word of God only, Who,
   incorporeal by nature, appeared for our sakes in the body and suffered
   for all. 3. Or if not even this is sufficient for them, let them at
   least be silenced by another proof, seeing how clear its demonstrative
   force is. For the Scripture says: "Be strong [301] ye hands that hang
   down, and feeble knees; comfort ye, ye of faint mind; be strong, fear
   not. Behold, our God recompenseth judgment; He shall come and save us.
   Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf
   shall hear; then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of
   the stammerers shall be plain." 4. Now what can they say to this, or
   how can they dare to face this at all? For the prophecy not only
   indicates that God is to sojourn here, but it announces the signs and
   the time of His coming. For they connect the blind recovering their
   sight, and the lame walking, and the deaf hearing, and the tongue of
   the stammerers being made plain, with the Divine Coming which is to
   take place. Let them say, then, when such signs have come to pass in
   Israel, or where in Jewry anything of the sort has occurred. 5. Naaman,
   a leper, was cleansed, but no deaf man heard nor lame walked. Elias
   raised a dead man; so did Eliseus; but none blind from birth regained
   his sight. For in good truth, to raise a dead man is a great thing, but
   it is not like the wonder wrought by the Saviour. Only, if Scripture
   has not passed over the case of the leper, and of the dead son of the
   widow, certainly, had it come to pass that a lame man also had walked
   and a blind man recovered his sight, the narrative would not have
   omitted to mention this also. Since then nothing is said in the
   Scriptures, it is evident that these things had never taken place
   before. 6. When, then, have they taken place, save when the Word of God
   Himself came in the body? Or when did He come, if not when lame men
   walked, and stammerers were made to speak plain, and deaf men heard,
   and men blind from birth regained their sight? For this was the very
   thing the Jews said who then witnessed it, because they had not heard
   of these things having taken place at any other time: "Since [302] the
   world began it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man
   born blind. If this man were not from God, He could do nothing."

   Â§39. Do you look for another? But Daniel foretells the exact time.
   Objections to this removed.

   But perhaps, being unable, even they, to fight continually against
   plain facts, they will, without denying what is written, maintain that
   they are looking for these things, and that the Word of God is not yet
   come. For this it is on which they are for ever harping, not blushing
   to brazen it out in the face of plain facts. 2. But on this one point,
   above all, they shall be all the more refuted, not at our hands, but at
   those of the most wise Daniel, who marks both the actual date, and the
   divine sojourn of the Saviour, saying: "Seventy [303] weeks are cut
   short upon thy people, and upon the holy city, for a full end to be
   made of sin, and for sins to be sealed up, and to blot out iniquities,
   and to make atonement for iniquities, and to bring everlasting
   righteousness, and to seal vision and prophet, and to anoint a Holy of
   Holies; and thou shalt know and understand from the going forth of the
   word to restore [304] and to build Jerusalem unto Christ the Prince" 3.
   Perhaps with regard to the other (prophecies) they may be able even to
   find excuses and to put off what is written to a future time. But what
   can they say to this, or can they face it at all? Where not only is the
   Christ referred to, but He that is to be anointed is declared to be not
   man simply, but Holy of Holies; and Jerusalem is to stand till His
   coming, and thenceforth, prophet and vision cease in Israel. 4. David
   was anointed of old, and Solomon and Ezechias; but then, nevertheless,
   Jerusalem and the place stood, and prophets were prophesying: God and
   Asaph and Nathan; and, later, Esaias and Osee and Amos and others. And
   again, the actual men that were anointed were called holy, and not Holy
   of Holies. 5. But if they shield themselves with the captivity, and say
   that because of it Jerusalem was not, what can they say about the
   prophets too? For in fact when first the people went down to Babylon,
   Daniel and Jeremy were there, and Ezechiel and AggÃ¦us and Zachary were
   prophesying.

   Â§40. Argument (1) from the withdrawal of prophecy and destruction of
   Jerusalem, (2) from the conversion of the Gentiles, and that to the God
   of Moses. What more remains for the Messiah to do, that Christ has not
   done?

   So the Jews are trifling, and the time in question, which they refer to
   the future, is actually come. For when did prophet and vision cease
   from Israel, save when Christ came, the Holy of Holies? For it is a
   sign, and an important proof, of the coming of the Word of God, that
   Jerusalem no longer stands, nor is any prophet raised up nor vision
   revealed to them,--and that very naturally. 2. For when He that was
   signified was come, what need was there any longer of any to signify
   Him? When the truth was there, what need any more of the shadow? For
   this was the reason of their prophesying at all,--namely, till the true
   Righteousness should come, and He that was to ransom the sins of all.
   And this was why Jerusalem stood till then--namely, that there they
   might be exercised in the types as a preparation for the reality. 3. So
   when the Holy of Holies was come, naturally vision and prophecy were
   sealed and the kingdom of Jerusalem ceased. For kings were to be
   anointed among them only until the Holy of Holies should have been
   anointed; and Jacob prophesies that the kingdom of the Jews should be
   established until Him, as follows:--"The ruler [305] shall not fail
   from Juda, nor the Prince from his loins, until that which is laid up
   for him shall come; and he is the expectation of the nations." 4.
   Whence the Saviour also Himself cried aloud and said: "The [306] law
   and the prophets prophesied until John." If then there is now among the
   Jews king or prophet or vision, they do well to deny the Christ that is
   come. But if there is neither king nor vision, but from that time forth
   all prophecy is sealed and the city and temple taken, why are they so
   irreligious and so perverse as to see what has happened, and yet to
   deny Christ, Who has brought it all to pass? Or why, when they see even
   heathens deserting their idols, and placing their hope, through Christ,
   on the God of Israel, do they deny Christ, Who was born of the root of
   Jesse after the flesh and henceforth is King? For if the nations were
   worshipping some other God, and not confessing the God of Abraham and
   Isaac and Jacob and Moses, then, once more, they would be doing well in
   alleging that God had not come. 5. But if the Gentiles are honouring
   the same God that gave the law to Moses and made the promise to
   Abraham, and Whose word the Jews dishonoured,--why are they ignorant,
   or rather why do they choose to ignore, that the Lord foretold by the
   Scriptures has shone forth upon the world, and appeared to it in bodily
   form, as the Scripture said: "The [307] Lord God hath shined upon us;"
   and again: "He [308] sent His Word and healed them;" and again: "Not
   [309] a messenger, not an angel, but the Lord Himself saved them?" 6.
   Their state may be compared to that of one out of his right mind, who
   sees the earth illumined by the sun, but denies the sun that illumines
   it. For what more is there for him whom they expect to do, when he is
   come? To call the heathen? But they are called already. To make
   prophecy, and king, and vision to cease? This too has already come to
   pass. To expose the godlessness of idolatry? It is already exposed and
   condemned. Or to destroy death? He is already destroyed. 7. What then
   has not come to pass, that the Christ must do? What is left
   unfulfilled, that the Jews should now disbelieve with impunity? For if,
   I say,--which is just what we actually see,--there is no longer king
   nor prophet nor Jerusalem nor sacrifice nor vision among them, but even
   the whole earth is filled with the knowledge of God, and Gentiles,
   leaving their godlessness, are now taking refuge with the God of
   Abraham, through the Word, even our Lord Jesus Christ, then it must be
   plain, even to those who are exceedingly obstinate, that the Christ is
   come, and that He has illumined absolutely all with His light, and
   given them the true and divine teaching concerning His Father. 8. So
   one can fairly refute the Jews by these and by other arguments from the
   Divine Scriptures.

   human body is a part of the same whole.

   But one cannot but be utterly astonished at the Gentiles, who, while
   they laugh at what is no matter for jesting, are themselves insensible
   to their own disgrace, which they do not see that they have set up in
   the shape of stocks and stones. 2. Only, as our argument is not lacking
   in demonstrative proof, come let us put them also to shame on
   reasonable grounds,--mainly from what we ourselves also see. For what
   is there on our side that is absurd, or worthy of derision? Is it
   merely our saying that the Word has been made manifest in the body? But
   this even they will join in owning to have happened without any
   absurdity, if they show themselves friends of truth. 3. If then they
   deny that there is a Word of God at all, they do so gratuitously [310]
   , jesting at what they know not. 4. But if they confess that there is a
   Word of God, and He ruler of the universe, and that in Him the Father
   has produced the creation, and that by His Providence the whole
   receives light and life and being, and that He reigns over all, so that
   from the works of His providence He is known, and through Him the
   Father,--consider, I pray you, whether they be not unwittingly raising
   the jest against themselves. 5. The philosophers of the Greeks say that
   the universe is a great body [311] ; and rightly so. For we see it and
   its parts as objects of our senses. If, then, the Word of God is in the
   Universe, which is a body, and has united Himself with the whole and
   with all its parts, what is there surprising or absurd if we say that
   He has united Himself [312] with man also. 6. For if it were absurd for
   Him to have been in a body at all, it would be absurd for Him to be
   united with the whole either, and to be giving light and movement to
   all things by His providence. For the whole also is a body. 7. But if
   it beseems Him to unite Himself with the universe, and to be made known
   in the whole, it must beseem Him also to appear in a human body, and
   that by Him it should be illumined and work. For mankind is part of the
   whole as well as the rest. And if it be unseemly for a part to have
   been adopted as His instrument to teach men of His Godhead, it must be
   most absurd that He should be made known even by the whole universe.

   [310] Athan. here assumes, for the purpose of his argument, the
   principles of the Neo-platonist schools. They were influenced, in
   regard to the Logos, by Philo, but even on this subject the germ of
   their teaching may be traced in Plato, especially in the TimÃ¦us, (See
   Drummond's Philo, i. 65-88, Bigg's Bamp. Lect. 14, 18, 248-253, and St.
   Aug. Confess. in Nicene Fathers,' Series 1, vol. 1, p. 107 and notes.)

   [311] Especially Plato, Tim. 30, &c.

   [312] epibebekenai, cf. above, 20. 4, 6. The Union of God and Man in
   Christ is of course hypostatic' or personal, and thus (supra 17. 1),
   different in kind from the union of the Word with Creation. His
   argument is ad homines. It was not for thinkers who identified the
   Universe with God to take exception to the idea of Incarnation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§42. His union with the body is based upon His relation to Creation as
   a whole. He used a human body, since to man it was that He wished to
   reveal Himself.

   For just as, while the whole body is quickened and illumined by man,
   supposing one said it were absurd that man's power should also be in
   the toe, he would be thought foolish; because, while granting that he
   pervades and works in the whole, he demurs to his being in the part
   also; thus he who grants and believes that the Word of God is in the
   whole Universe, and that the whole is illumined and moved by Him,
   should not think it absurd that a single human body also should receive
   movement and light from Him. 2. But if it is because the human race is
   a thing created and has been made out of nothing, that they regard that
   manifestation of the Saviour in man, which we speak of, as not seemly,
   it is high time for them to eject Him from creation also; for it too
   has been brought into existence by the Word out of nothing. 3. But if,
   even though creation be a thing made, it is not absurd that the Word
   should be in it, then neither is it absurd that He should be in man.
   For whatever idea they form of the whole, they must necessarily apply
   the like idea to the part. For man also, as I said before, is a part of
   the whole. 4. Thus it is not at all unseemly that the Word should be in
   man, while all things are deriving from Him their light and movement
   and light, as also their authors say, "In [313] him we live and move
   and have our being." 5. So, then, what is there to scoff at in what we
   say, if the Word has used that, wherein He is, as an instrument to
   manifest Himself? For were He not in it, neither could He have used it;
   but if we have previously allowed that He is in the whole and in its
   parts, what is there incredible in His manifesting Himself in that
   wherein He is? 6. For by His own power He is united [314] wholly with
   each and all, and orders all things without stint, so that no one could
   have called it out of place for Him to speak, and make known Himself
   and His Father, by means of sun, if He so willed, or moon, or heaven,
   or earth, or waters, or fire [315] ; inasmuch as He holds in one all
   things at once, and is in fact not only in all but also in the part in
   question, and there invisibly manifests Himself. In like manner it
   cannot be absurd if, ordering as He does the whole, and giving life to
   all things, and having willed to make Himself known through men, He has
   used as His instrument a human body to manifest the truth and knowledge
   of the Father. For humanity, too, is an actual part of the whole. 7.
   And as Mind, pervading man all through, is interpreted by a part of the
   body, I mean the tongue, without any one saying, I suppose, that the
   essence of the mind is on that account lowered, so if the Word,
   pervading all things, has used a human instrument, this cannot appear
   unseemly. For, as I have said previously, if it be unseemly to have
   used a body as an instrument, it is unseemly also for Him to be in the
   Whole.

   Â§43. He came in human rather than in any nobler form, because (I) He
   came to save, not to impress ; (2) man alone of creatures had sinned.
   As men would not recognise His works in the Universe, He came and
   worked among them as Man; in the sphere to which they had limited
   themselves.

   Now, if they ask, Why then did He not appear by means of other and
   nobler parts of creation, and use some nobler instrument, as the sun,
   or moon, or stars, or fire, or air, instead of man merely? let them
   know that the Lord came not to make a display, but to heal and teach
   those who were suffering. 2. For the way for one aiming at display
   would be, just to appear, and to dazzle the beholders; but for one
   seeking to heal and teach the way is, not simply to sojourn here, but
   to give himself to the aid of those in want, and to appear as they who
   need him can bear it; that he may not, by exceeding the requirements of
   the sufferers, trouble the very persons that need him, rendering God's
   appearance useless to them. 3. Now, nothing in creation had gone astray
   with regard to their notions of God, save man only. Why, neither sun,
   nor moon, nor heaven, nor the stars, nor water, nor air had swerved
   from their order; but knowing their Artificer and Sovereign, the Word,
   they remain as they were made [316] . But men alone, having rejected
   what was good, then devised things of nought instead of the truth, and
   have ascribed the honour due to God, and their knowledge of Him, to
   demons and men in the shape of stones. 4. With reason, then, since it
   were unworthy of the Divine Goodness to overlook so grave a matter,
   while yet men were not able to recognise Him as ordering and guiding
   the whole, He takes to Himself as an instrument a part of the whole,
   His human body, and unites [317] Himself with that, in order that since
   men could not recognise Him in the whole, they should not fail to know
   Him in the part; and since they could not look up to His invisible
   power, might be able, at any rate, from what resembled themselves to
   reason to Him and to contemplate Him. 5. For, men as they are, they
   will be able to know His Father more quickly and directly by a body of
   like nature and by the divine works wrought through it, judging by
   comparison that they are not human, but the works of God, which are
   done by Him. 6. And if it were absurd, as they say, for the Word to be
   known through the works of the body, it would likewise be absurd for
   Him to be known through the works of the universe. For just as He is in
   creation, and yet does not partake of its nature in the least degree,
   but rather all things partake [318] of His power; so while He used the
   body as His instrument He partook of no corporeal property, but, on the
   contrary, Himself sanctified even the body. 7. For if even Plato, who
   is in such repute among the Greeks, says [319] that its author,
   beholding the universe tempest-tossed, and in peril of going down to
   the place of chaos, takes his seat at the helm of the soul and comes to
   the rescue and corrects all its calamities; what is there incredible in
   what we say, that, mankind being in error, the Word lighted down [320]
   upon it and appeared as man, that He might save it in its tempest by
   His guidance and goodness?

   Â§44. As God made man by a word, why not restore him by a word? But (1)
   creation out of nothing is different from reparation of what already
   exists. (2) Man was there with a definite need, calling for a definite
   remedy. Death was ingrained in man's nature: He then must wind life
   closely to human nature. Therefore the Word became Incarnate that He
   might meet and conquer death in His usurped territory. (Simile of straw
   and asbestos.)

   But perhaps, shamed into agreeing with this, they will choose to say
   that God, if He wished to reform and to save mankind, ought to have
   done so by a mere fiat [321] , without His word taking a body, in just
   the same way as He did formerly, when He produced them out of nothing.
   2. To this objection of theirs a reasonable answer would be: that
   formerly, nothing being in existence at all, what was needed to make
   everything was a fiat and the bare will to do so. But when man had once
   been made, and necessity demanded a cure, not for things that were not,
   but for things that had come to be, it was naturally consequent that
   the Physician and Saviour should appear in what had come to be, in
   order also to cure the things that were. For this cause, then, He has
   become man, and used His body as a human instrument. 3. For if this
   were not the right way, how was the Word, choosing to use an
   instrument, to appear? or whence was He to take it, save from those
   already in being, and in need of His Godhead by means of one like
   themselves? For it was not things without being that needed salvation,
   so that a bare command should suffice, but man, already in existence,
   was going to corruption and ruin [322] . It was then natural and right
   that the Word should use a human instrument and reveal Himself
   everywhither. 4. Secondly, you must know this also, that the corruption
   which had set in was not external to the body, but had become attached
   to it; and it was required that, instead of corruption, life should
   cleave to it; so that, just as death has been engendered in the body,
   so life may be engendered in it also. 5. Now if death were external to
   the body, it would be proper for life also to have been engendered
   externally to it. But if death was wound closely to the body and was
   ruling over it as though united to it, it was required that life also
   should be wound closely to the body, that so the body, by putting on
   life in its stead, should cast off corruption. Besides, even supposing
   that the Word had come outside the body, and not in it, death would
   indeed have been defeated by Him, in perfect accordance with nature,
   inasmuch as death has no power against the Life; but the corruption
   attached to the body would have remained in it none the less [323] . 6.
   For this cause the Saviour reasonably put on Him a body, in order that
   the body, becoming wound closely to the Life, should no longer, as
   mortal, abide in death, but, as having put on immortality, should
   thenceforth rise again and remain immortal. For, once it had put on
   corruption, it could not have risen again unless it had put on life.
   And death likewise could not, from its very nature, appear, save in the
   body. Therefore He put on a body, that He might find death in the body,
   and blot it out. For how could the Lord have been proved at all to be
   the Life, had He not quickened what was mortal? 7. And just as, whereas
   stubble is naturally destructible by fire, supposing (firstly) a man
   keeps fire away from the stubble, though it is not burned, yet the
   stubble remains, for all that, merely stubble, fearing the threat of
   the fire--for fire has the natural property of consuming it; while if a
   man (secondly) encloses it with a quantity of asbestos, the substance
   said [324] to be an antidote to fire, the stubble no longer dreads the
   fire, being secured by its enclosure in incombustible matter; 8. in
   this very way one may say, with regard to the body and death, that if
   death had been kept from the body by a mere command on His part, it
   would none the less have been mortal and corruptible, according to the
   nature of bodies; but, that this should not be, it put on the
   incorporeal Word of God, and thus no longer fears either death or
   corruption, for it has life as a garment, and corruption is done away
   in it.

   Â§45. Thus once again every part of creation manifests the glory of God.
   Nature, the witness to her Creator, yields (by miracles) a second
   testimony to God Incarnate. The witness of Nature, perverted by man's
   sin, was thus forced back to truth. If these reasons suffice not, let
   the Greeks look at facts.

   Consistently, therefore, the Word of God took a body and has made use
   of a human instrument, in order to quicken the body also, and as He is
   known in creation by His works so to work in man as well, and to shew
   Himself everywhere, leaving nothing void of His own divinity, and of
   the knowledge of Him. 2. For I resume, and repeat what I said before,
   that the Saviour did this in order that, as He fills all things on all
   sides by His presence, so also He might fill all things with the
   knowledge of Him, as the divine Scripture also says [325] : "The whole
   earth was filled with the knowledge of the Lord." 3. For if a man will
   but look up to heaven, he sees its Order, or if he cannot raise his
   face to heaven, but only to man, he sees His power, beyond comparison
   with that of men, shewn by His works, and learns that He alone among
   men is God the Word. Or if a man is gone astray among demons, and is in
   fear of them, he may see this man drive them out, and make up his mind
   that He is their Master. Or if a man has sunk to the waters [326] , and
   thinks that they are God,--as the Egyptians, for instance, reverence
   the water,--he may see its nature changed by Him, and learn that the
   Lord is Creator of the waters. 4. But if a man is gone down even to
   Hades, and stands in awe of the heroes who have descended thither,
   regarding them as gods, yet he may see the fact of Christ's
   Resurrection and victory over death, and infer that among them also
   Christ alone is true God and Lord. 5. For the Lord touched all parts of
   creation, and freed and undeceived all of them from every illusion; as
   Paul says: "Having [327] put off from Himself the principalities and
   the powers, He triumphed on the Cross:" that no one might by any
   possibility be any longer deceived, but everywhere might find the true
   Word of God. 6. For thus man, shut in on every side [328] , and
   beholding the divinity of the Word unfolded everywhere, that is, in
   heaven, in Hades, in man, upon earth, is no longer exposed to deceit
   concerning God, but is to worship Christ alone, and through Him come
   rightly to know the Father. 7. By these arguments, then, on grounds of
   reason, the Gentiles in their turn will fairly be put to shame by us.
   But if they deem the arguments insufficient to shame them, let them be
   assured of what we are saying at any rate by facts obvious to the sight
   of all.

   Â§46. Discredit, from the date of the Incarnation, of idol-cultus,
   oracles, mythologies, demoniacal energy, magic, and Gentile philosophy.
   And whereas the old cults were strictly local and independent, the
   worship of Christ is catholic and uniform.

   When did men begin to desert the worshipping of idols, save since God,
   the true Word of God, has come among men? Or when have the oracles
   among the Greeks, and everywhere, ceased and become empty, save when
   the Saviour has manifested Himself upon earth? 2. Or when did those who
   are called gods and heroes in the poets begin to be convicted of being
   merely mortal men [329] , save since the Lord erected His conquest of
   death, and preserved incorruptible the body he had taken, raising it
   from the dead? 3. Or when did the deceitfulness and madness of demons
   fall into contempt, save when the power of God, the Word, the Master of
   all these as well, condescending because of man's weakness, appeared on
   earth? Or when [330] did the art and the schools of magic begin to be
   trodden down, save when the divine manifestation of the Word took place
   among men? 4. And, in a word, at what time has the wisdom of the Greeks
   become foolish, save when the true Wisdom of God manifested itself on
   earth? For formerly the whole world and every place was led astray by
   the worshipping of idols, and men regarded nothing else but the idols
   as gods. But now, all the world over, men are deserting the
   superstition of the idols, and taking refuge with Christ; and,
   worshipping Him as God, are by His means coming to know that Father
   also Whom they knew not. 5. And, marvellous fact, whereas the objects
   of worship were various and of vast number, and each place had its own
   idol, and he who was accounted a god among them had no power to pass
   over to the neighbouring place, so as to persuade those of neighbouring
   peoples to worship him, but was barely served even among his own
   people; for no one else worshipped his neighbour's god--on the
   contrary, each man kept to his own idol [331] , thinking it to be lord
   of all;--Christ alone is worshipped as one and the same among all
   peoples; and what the weakness of the idols could not do--to persuade,
   namely, even those dwelling close at hand,--this Christ has done,
   persuading not only those close at hand, but simply the entire world,
   to worship one and the same Lord, and through Him God, even His Father.

   Â§47. The numerous oracles,--fancied apparitions in sacred places, &c.,
   dispelled by the sign of the Cross. The old gods prove to have been
   mere men. Magic is exposed. And whereas Philosophy could only persuade
   select and local cliques of Immortality, and goodness,--men of little
   intellect have infused into the multitudes of the churches the
   principle of a supernatural life.

   And whereas formerly every place was full of the deceit of the oracles
   [332] , and the oracles at Delphi and Dodona, and in Boeotia [333] and
   Lycia [334] and Libya [335] and Egypt and those of the Cabiri [336] ,
   and the Pythoness, were held in repute by men's imagination, now, since
   Christ has begun to be preached everywhere, their madness also has
   ceased and there is none among them to divine any more. 2. And whereas
   formerly demons used to deceive [337] men's fancy, occupying springs or
   rivers, trees or stones, and thus imposed upon the simple by their
   juggleries; now, after the divine visitation of the Word, their
   deception has ceased. For by the Sign of the Cross, though a man but
   use it, he drives out their deceits. 3. And while formerly men held to
   be gods the Zeus and Cronos and Apollo and the heroes mentioned in the
   poets, and went astray in honouring them; now that the Saviour has
   appeared among men, those others have been exposed as mortal men [338]
   , and Christ alone has been recognised among men as the true God, the
   Word of God. 4. And what is one to say of the magic [339] esteemed
   among them? that before the Word sojourned among us this was strong and
   active among Egyptians, and Chaldees, and Indians, and inspired awe in
   those who saw it; but that by the presence of the Truth, and the
   Appearing of the Word, it also has been thoroughly confuted, and
   brought wholly to nought. 5. But as to Gentile wisdom, and the sounding
   pretensions of the philosophers, I think none can need our argument,
   since the wonder is before the eyes of all, that while the wise among
   the Greeks had written so much, and were unable to persuade even a few
   [340] from their own neighbourhood, concerning immortality and a
   virtuous life, Christ alone, by ordinary language, and by men not
   clever with the tongue, has throughout all the world persuaded whole
   churches full of men to despise death, and to mind the things of
   immortality; to overlook what is temporal and to turn their eyes to
   what is eternal; to think nothing of earthly glory and to strive only
   for the heavenly.

   Â§48. Further facts. Christian continence of virgins and ascetics.
   Martyrs. The power of the Cross against demons and magic. Christ by His
   Power shews Himself more than a man, more than a magician, more than a
   spirit. For all these are totally subject to Him. Therefore He is the
   Word of God.

   Now these arguments of ours do not amount merely to words, but have in
   actual experience a witness to their truth. 2. For let him that will,
   go up and behold the proof of virtue in the virgins of Christ and in
   the young men that practise holy chastity [341] , and the assurance of
   immortality in so great a band of His martyrs. 3. And let him come who
   would test by experience what we have now said, and in the very
   presence of the deceit of demons and the imposture of oracles and the
   marvels of magic, let him use the Sign of that Cross which is laughed
   at among them, and he shall see how by its means demons fly, oracles
   cease, all magic and witchcraft is brought to nought. 4. Who, then, and
   how great is this Christ, Who by His own Name and Presence casts into
   the shade and brings to nought all things on every side, and is alone
   strong against all, and has filled the whole world with His teaching?
   Let the Greeks tell us, who are pleased to laugh, and blush not. 5. For
   if He is a man, how then has one man exceeded the power of all whom
   even themselves bold to be gods, and convicted them by His own power of
   being nothing? But if they call Him a magician, how can it be that by a
   magician all magic is destroyed, instead of being confirmed? For if He
   conquered particular magicians, or prevailed over one only, it would be
   proper for them to hold that He excelled the rest by superior skill; 6.
   but if His Cross has won the victory over absolutely all magic, and
   over the very name of it, it must be plain that the Saviour is not a
   magician, seeing that even those demons who are invoked by the other
   magicians fly from Him as their Master. 7. Who He is, then, let the
   Greeks tell us, whose only serious pursuit is jesting. Perhaps they
   might say that He, too, was a demon, and hence His strength. But say
   this as they will, they will have the laugh against them, for they can
   once more be put to shame by our former proofs. For how is it possible
   that He should be a demon who drives the demons out? 8. For if He
   simply drove out particular demons, it might properly be held that by
   the chief of demons He prevailed against the lesser, just as the Jews
   said to Him when they wished to insult Him. But if, by His Name being
   named, all madness of the demons is uprooted and chased away, it must
   be evident that here, too, they are wrong, and that our Lord and
   Saviour Christ is not, as they think, some demoniacal power. 9. Then,
   if the Saviour is neither a man simply, nor a magician, nor some demon,
   but has by His own Godhead brought to nought and cast into the shade
   both the doctrine found in the poets and the delusion of the demons and
   the wisdom of the Gentiles, it must be plain and will be owned by all,
   that this is the true Son of God, even the Word and Wisdom and Power of
   the Father from the beginning. For this is why His works also are no
   works of man, but are recognised to be above man, and truly God's
   works, both from the facts in themselves, and from comparison with [the
   rest of] mankind.

   Â§49. His Birth and Miracles. You call Asclepius, Heracles, and Dionysus
   gods for their works. Contrast their works with His, and the wonders at
   His death, &c.

   For what man, that ever was born, formed a body for himself from a
   virgin alone? Or what man ever healed such diseases as the common Lord
   of all? Or who has restored what was wanting to man's nature, and made
   one blind from his birth to see? 2. Asclepius was deified among them,
   because he practised medicine and found out herbs for bodies that were
   sick; not forming them himself out of the earth, but discovering them
   by science drawn from nature. But what is this to what was done by the
   Saviour, in that, instead of healing a wound, He modified a man's
   original nature, and restored the body whole. 3. Heracles is worshipped
   as a god among the Greeks because he fought against men, his peers, and
   destroyed wild beasts by guile. What is this to what was done by the
   Word, in driving away from man diseases and demons and death itself?
   Dionysus is worshipped among them because he has taught man
   drunkenness; but the true Saviour and Lord of all, for teaching
   temperance, is mocked by these people. 4. But let these matters pass.
   What will they say to the other miracles of His Godhead? At what man's
   death was the sun darkened and the earth shaken? Lo even to this day
   men are dying, and they died also of old. When did any such-like wonder
   happen in their case? 5. Or, to pass over the deeds done through His
   body, and mention those after its rising again: what man's doctrine
   that ever was has prevailed everywhere, one and the same, from one end
   of the earth to the other, so that his worship has winged its way
   through every land? 6. Or why, if Christ is, as they say, a man, and
   not God the Word, is not His worship prevented by the gods they have
   from passing into the same land where they are? Or why on the contrary
   does the Word Himself, sojourning here, by His teaching stop their
   worship and put their deception to shame?
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§50. Impotence and rivalries of the Sophists put to shame by the Death
   of Christ. His Resurrection unparalleled even in Greek legend.

   Many before this Man have been kings and tyrants of the world, many are
   on record who have been wise men and magicians, among the ChaldÃ¦ans and
   Egyptians and Indians; which of these, I say, not after death, but
   while still alive, was ever able so far to prevail as to fill the whole
   earth with his teaching and reform so great a multitude from the
   superstition of idols, as our Saviour has brought over from idols to
   Himself? 2. The philosophers of the Greeks have composed many works
   with plausibility and verbal skill; what result, then, have they
   exhibited so great as has the Cross of Christ? For the refinements they
   taught were plausible enough till they died; but even the influence
   they seemed to have while alive was subject to their mutual rivalries;
   and they were emulous, and declaimed against one another. 3. But the
   Word of God, most strange fact, teaching in meaner language, has cast
   into the shade the choice sophists; and while He has, by drawing all to
   Himself, brought their schools to nought, He has filled His own
   churches; and the marvellous thing is, that by going down as man to
   death, He has brought to nought the sounding utterances of the wise
   [342] concerning idols. 4. For whose death ever drove out demons? or
   whose death did demons ever fear, as they did that of Christ? For where
   the Saviour's name is named, there every demon is driven out. Or who
   has so rid men of the passions of the natural man, that whoremongers
   are chaste, and murderers no longer hold the sword, and those who were
   formerly mastered by cowardice play the man? 5. And, in short, who
   persuaded men of barbarous countries and heathen men in divers places
   to lay aside their madness, and to mind peace, if it be not the Faith
   of Christ and the Sign of the Cross? Or who else has given men such
   assurance of immortality, as has the Cross of Christ, and the
   Resurrection of His Body? 6. For although the Greeks have told all
   manner of false tales, yet they were not able to feign a Resurrection
   of their idols,--for it never crossed their mind, whether it be at all
   possible for the body again to exist after death. And here one would
   most especially accept their testimony, inasmuch as by this opinion
   they have exposed the weakness of their own idolatry, while leaving the
   possibility open to Christ, so that hence also He might be made known
   among all as Son of God.

   Â§51. The new virtue of continence. Revolution of Society, purified and
   pacified by Christianity.

   Which of mankind, again, after his death, or else while living, taught
   concerning virginity, and that this virtue was not impossible among
   men? But Christ, our Saviour and King of all, had such power in His
   teaching concerning it, that even children not yet arrived at the
   lawful age vow that virginity which lies beyond the law. 2. What man
   has ever yet been able to pass so far as to come among Scythians and
   Ethiopians, or Persians or Armenians or Goths, or those we hear of
   beyond the ocean or those beyond Hyrcania, or even the Egyptians and
   Chaldees, men that mind magic and are superstitious beyond nature and
   savage in their ways, and to preach at all about virtue and
   self-control, and against the worshipping of idols, as has the Lord of
   all, the Power of God, our Lord Jesus Christ? 3. Who not only preached
   by means of His own disciples, but also carried persuasion to men's
   mind, to lay aside the fierceness of their manners, and no longer to
   serve their ancestral gods, but to learn to know Him, and through Him
   to worship the Father. 4. For formerly, while in idolatry, Greeks and
   Barbarians used to war against each other, and were actually cruel to
   their own kin. For it was impossible for any one to cross sea or land
   at all, without arming the hand with swords [343] , because of their
   implacable fighting among themselves. 5. For the whole course of their
   life was carried on by arms, and the sword with them took the place of
   a staff, and was their support in every emergency; and still, as I said
   before, they were serving idols, and offering sacrifices to demons,
   while for all their idolatrous superstition they could not be reclaimed
   from this spirit. 6. But when they have come over to the school of
   Christ, then, strangely enough, as men truly pricked in conscience,
   they have laid aside the savagery of their murders and no longer mind
   the things of war: but all is at peace with them, and from henceforth
   what makes for friendship is to their liking.

   Â§52. Wars, &c., roused by demons, lulled by Christianity.

   Who then is He that has done this, or who is He that has united in
   peace men that hated one another, save the beloved Son of the Father,
   the common Saviour of all, even Jesus Christ, Who by His own love
   underwent all things for our salvation? For even from of old it was
   prophesied of the peace He was to usher in, where the Scripture says:
   "They [344] shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their pikes
   into sickles, and nation shall not take the sword against nation,
   neither shall they learn war any more." 2. And this is at least not
   incredible, inasmuch as even now those barbarians who have an innate
   savagery of manners, while they still sacrifice to the idols of their
   country, are mad against one another, and cannot endure to be a single
   hour without weapons: 3. but when they hear the teaching of Christ,
   straightway instead of fighting they turn to husbandry, and instead of
   arming their hands with weapons they raise them in prayer, and in a
   word, in place of fighting among themselves, henceforth they arm
   against the devil and against evil spirits, subduing these by
   self-restraint and virtue of soul. 4. Now this is at once a proof of
   the divinity of the Saviour, since what men could not learn among idols
   [345] they have learned from Him; and no small exposure of the weakness
   and nothingness of demons and idols. For demons, knowing their own
   weakness, for this reason formerly set men to make war against one
   another, lest, if they ceased from mutual strife, they should turn to
   battle against demons. 5. Why, they who become disciples of Christ,
   instead of warring with each other, stand arrayed against demons by
   their habits and their virtuous actions: and they rout them, and mock
   at their captain the devil; so that in youth they are self-restrained,
   in temptations endure, in labours persevere, when insulted are patient,
   when robbed make light of it: and, wonderful as it is, they despise
   even death and become martyrs of Christ.

   Quietem habere non posse.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§53. The whole fabric of Gentilism levelled at a blow by Christ
   secretly addressing the conscience of Man.

   And to mention one proof of the divinity of the Saviour, which is
   indeed utterly surprising,--what mere man or magician or tyrant or king
   was ever able by himself to engage with so many, and to fight the
   battle against all idolatry and the whole demoniacal host and all
   magic, and all the wisdom of the Greeks, while they were so strong and
   still flourishing and imposing upon all, and at one onset to check them
   all, as was our Lord, the true Word of God, Who, invisibly exposing
   each man's error, is by Himself bearing off all men from them all, so
   that while they who were worshipping idols now trample upon them, those
   in repute for magic burn their books, and the wise prefer to all
   studies the interpretation of the Gospels? 2. For whom they used to
   worship, them they are deserting, and Whom they used to mock as one
   crucified, Him they worship as Christ, confessing Him to be God. And
   they that are called gods among them are routed by the Sign of the
   Cross, while the Crucified Saviour is proclaimed in all the world as
   God and the Son of God. And the gods worshipped among the Greeks are
   falling into ill repute at their hands, as scandalous beings; while
   those who receive the teaching of Christ live a chaster life than they.
   3. If, then, these and the like are human works, let him who will point
   out similar works on the part of men of former time, and so convince
   us. But if they prove to be, and are, not men's works, but God's, why
   are the unbelievers so irreligious as not to recognise the Master that
   wrought them? 4. For their case is as though a man, from the works of
   creation, failed to know God their Artificer. For if they knew His
   Godhead from His power over the universe, they would have known that
   the bodily works of Christ also are not human, but are the works of the
   Saviour of all, the Word of God. And did they thus know, "they would
   not," as Paul said [346] , "have crucified the Lord of glory."

   Â§54. The Word Incarnate, as is the case with the Invisible God, is
   known to us by His works. By them we recognise His deifying mission.
   Let us be content to enumerate a few of them, leaving their dazzling
   plentitude to him who will behold.

   As, then, if a man should wish to see God, Who is invisible by nature
   and not seen at all, he may know and apprehend Him from His works: so
   let him who fails to see Christ with his understanding, at least
   apprehend Him by the works of His body, and test whether they be human
   works or God's works. 2. And if they be human, let him scoff; but if
   they are not human, but of God, let him recognise it, and not laugh at
   what is no matter for scoffing; but rather let him marvel that by so
   ordinary a means things divine have been manifested to us, and that by
   death immortality has reached to all, and that by the Word becoming
   man, the universal Providence has been known, and its Giver and
   Artificer the very Word of God. 3. For He was made man that we might be
   made God [347] ; and He manifested Himself by a body that we might
   receive the idea of the unseen Father; and He endured the insolence of
   men that we might inherit immortality. For while He Himself was in no
   way injured, being impossible and incorruptible and very Word and God,
   men who were suffering, and for whose sakes He endured all this, He
   maintained and preserved in His own impassibility. 4. And, in a word,
   the achievements of the Saviour, resulting from His becoming man, are
   of such kind and number, that if one should wish to enumerate them, he
   may be compared to men who gaze at the expanse of the sea and wish to
   count its waves. For as one cannot take in the whole of the waves with
   his eyes, for those which are coming on baffle the sense of him that
   attempts it; so for him that would take in all the achievements of
   Christ in the body, it is impossible to take in the whole, even by
   reckoning them up, as those which go beyond his thought are more than
   those he thinks he has taken in. 5. Better is it, then, not to aim at
   speaking of the whole, where one cannot do justice even to a part, but,
   after mentioning one more, to leave the whole for you to marvel at. For
   all alike are marvellous, and wherever a man turns his glance, he may
   behold on that side the divinity of the Word, and be struck with
   exceeding great awe.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§55. Summary of foregoing. Cessation of pagan oracles, &c.: propagation
   of the faith. The true King has come forth and silenced all usurpers.

   This, then, after what we have so far said, it is right for you to
   realize, and to take as the sum of what we have already stated, and to
   marvel at exceedingly; namely, that since the Saviour has come among
   us, idolatry not only has no longer increased, but what there was is
   diminishing and gradually coming to an end: and not only does the
   wisdom of the Greeks no longer advance, but what there is is now fading
   away: and demons, so far from cheating any more by illusions and
   prophecies and magic arts, if they so much as dare to make the attempt,
   are put to shame by the sign of the Cross. 2. And to sum the matter up:
   behold how the Saviour's doctrine is everywhere increasing, while all
   idolatry and everything opposed to the faith of Christ is daily
   dwindling, and losing power, and falling. And thus beholding, worship
   the Saviour, "Who is above all" and mighty, even God the Word; and
   condemn those who are being worsted and done away by Him. 3. For as,
   when the sun is come, darkness no longer prevails, but if any be still
   left anywhere it is driven away; so, now that the divine Appearing of
   the Word of God is come, the darkness of the idols prevails no more,
   and all parts of the world in every direction are illumined by His
   teaching. 4. And as, when a king is reigning in some country without
   appearing but keeps at home in his own house, often some disorderly
   persons, abusing his retirement, proclaim themselves; and each of them,
   by assuming the character, imposes on the simple as king, and so men
   are led astray by the name, hearing that there is a king, but not
   seeing him, if for no other reason, because they cannot enter the
   house; but when the real king comes forth and appears, then the
   disorderly impostors are exposed by his presence, while men, seeing the
   real king, desert those who previously led them astray: 5. in like
   manner, the evil spirits formerly used to deceive men, investing
   themselves with God's honour; but when the Word of God appeared in a
   body, and made known to us His own Father, then at length the deceit of
   the evil spirits is done away and stopped, while men, turning their
   eyes to the true God, Word of the Father, are deserting the idols, and
   now coming to know the true God. 6. Now this is a proof that Christ is
   God the Word, and the Power of God. For whereas human things cease, and
   the Word of Christ abides, it is clear to all eyes that what ceases is
   temporary, but that He Who abides is God, and the true Son of God, His
   only-begotten Word.

   Â§56. Search then, the Scriptures, if you can, and so fill up this
   sketch. Learn to look for the Second Advent and Judgment.

   Let this, then, Christ-loving man, be our offering to you, just for a
   rudimentary sketch and outline, in a short compass, of the faith of
   Christ and of His Divine appearing to usward. But you, taking occasion
   by this, if you light upon the text of the Scriptures, by genuinely
   applying your mind to them, will learn from them more completely and
   clearly the exact detail of what we have said. 2. For they were spoken
   and written by God, through men who spoke of God. But we impart of what
   we have learned from inspired teachers who have been conversant with
   them, who have also become martyrs for the deity of Christ, to your
   zeal for learning, in turn. 3. And you will also learn about His second
   glorious and truly divine appearing to us, when no longer in lowliness,
   but in His own glory,--no longer in humble guise, but in His own
   magnificence,--He is to come, no more to suffer, but thenceforth to
   render to all the fruit of His own Cross, that is, the resurrection and
   incorruption; and no longer to be judged, but to judge all, by what
   each has done in the body, whether good or evil; where there is laid up
   for the good the kingdom of heaven, but for them that have done evil
   everlasting fire and outer darkness. 4. For thus the Lord Himself also
   says: "Henceforth [348] ye shall see the Son of Man sitting at the
   right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven in the glory of
   the Father." 5. And for this very reason there is also a word of the
   Saviour to prepare us for that day, in these words: "Be [349] ye ready
   and watch, for He cometh at an hour ye know not." For, according to the
   blessed Paul: "We [350] must all stand before the judgment-seat of
   Christ, that each one may receive according as he hath done in the
   body, whether it be good or bad."

   Â§57. Above all, so live that you may have the right to eat of this tree
   of knowledge and life, and so come to eternal joys. Doxology.

   But for the searching of the Scriptures and true knowledge of them, an
   honourable life is needed, and a pure soul, and that virtue which is
   according to Christ; so that the intellect guiding its path by it, may
   be able to attain what it desires, and to comprehend it, in so far as
   it is accessible to human nature to learn concerning the Word of God.
   2. For without a pure mind and a modelling of the life after the
   saints, a man could not possibly comprehend the words of the saints. 3.
   For just as, if a man wished to see the light of the sun, he would at
   any rate wipe and brighten his eye, purifying himself in some sort like
   what he desires, so that the eye, thus becoming light, may see the
   light of the sun; or as, if a man would see a city or country, he at
   any rate comes to the place to see it;--thus he that would comprehend
   the mind of those who speak of God must needs begin by washing and
   cleansing his soul, by his manner of living, and approach the saints
   themselves by imitating their works; so that, associated with them in
   the conduct of a common life, he may understand also what has been
   revealed to them by God, and thenceforth, as closely knit to them, may
   escape the peril of the sinners and their fire at the day of judgment,
   and receive what is laid up for the saints in the kingdom of heaven,
   which "Eye hath not seen [351] , nor ear heard, neither have entered
   into the heart of man," whatsoever things are prepared for them that
   live a virtuous life, and love the God and Father, in Christ Jesus our
   Lord: through Whom and with Whom be to the Father Himself, with the Son
   Himself, in the Holy Spirit, honour and might and glory for ever and
   ever. Amen.

   Depositio Arii.

   ------------------------

   Introduction to the Deposition of Arius' and Encyclical Letter of
   Alexander.

   The following documents form the fittest opening to the series of
   Anti-Arian writings of Athanasius. They are included in the Benedictine
   edition of his works, and in the Oxford Collection of Historical
   Tracts, of which the present translation is a revision. The possibility
   that the Encyclical Letter was drawn up by Athanasius himself, now
   deacon and Secretary to Bishop Alexander (Prolegg. ch. ii. Â§2), is a
   further reason for its inclusion. The Athanasian authorship is
   maintained by Newman on the following grounds, which his notes will be
   found to bear out. (1) Total dissimilarity of style as compared with
   Alexander's letter to his namesake of Byzantium (given by Theodoret, H.
   E. i. 4). That piece is in an elaborate and involved style, full of
   compound words, with nothing of the Athanasian simplicity and vigour.
   (2) Remarkable identity of style with that of Athanasius, extending to
   his most characteristic expressions. (3) Distinctness of the
   theological view' and terminology of Alexander as compared with
   Athanasius; the Encyclical coinciding with the latter against the
   former. (4) Athanasian use of certain texts. These arguments are of
   great weight, and make out at least a prima facie case for Newman's
   view. The latter has the weight of BÃ¶hringer's opinion on its side,
   while the counter-arguments of KÃ¶lling (vol. 1. p. 105) are trivial.
   Gwatkin, Studies, 29, note 4, misses the points (Nos. 1 and 3) of
   Newman's argument, which may fairly be said to hold the field. The
   deposition of Arius at Alexandria took place (Prolegg, ubi supra) in
   320 or 321; more likely the latter. Whether the Encyclical was drawn up
   at the Synod which deposed Arius, as is generally supposed, or some two
   years later, as has been inferred from the references to Eusebius of
   Nicomedia (D. C. B. i. 80, cf. Prolegg. ubi supra, note 1), is a
   question that may for our present purpose be left open. In any case it
   is one of the earliest documents of the Arian controversy. It should be
   noted that the homoousion does not occur in this document, a fact of
   importance in the history of the adoption of the word as a test at
   NicÃ¦a, cf. Prolegg. ch. ii. Â§3 (1) and (2) b. At this stage the
   Alexandrians were content with the formulÃ¦ homoios kat' ousian
   (Athan.), aparallaktos eikon, apekribomene emphereia (Alex. in Thdt.),
   which were afterwards found inadequate.

   The letter, after stating the circumstances which call it forth, and
   recording the doctrine propounded by Arius, and his deposition, points
   out some of the leading texts which condemn the doctrine (Â§Â§3, 4). The
   Arians are then (Â§5) compared to other heretics, and the bishops of the
   Church generally warned (Â§6) against the intrigues of Eusebius of
   Nicomedia. The letter is signed by the sixteen presbyters of
   Alexandria, and the twenty-four deacons (Athanasius signs fourth), as
   well as by eighteen presbyters and twenty deacons of the Mareotis. The
   scriptural argument of the Epistle is the germ of the polemic developed
   in the successive Anti-Arian treatises which form the bulk of the
   present volume.

   Deposition of Arius.

   ------------------------

   Alexander's Deposition of Arius and his companions, and Encyclical
   Letter on the subject.

   Alexander, being assembled with his beloved brethren, the Presbyters
   and Deacons of Alexandria, and the Mareotis, greets them in the Lord.

   Although you have already subscribed to the letter I addressed to Arius
   and his fellows, exhorting them to renounce his impiety, and to submit
   themselves to the sound Catholic Faith, and have shewn your
   right-mindedness and agreement in the doctrines of the Catholic Church:
   yet forasmuch as I have written also to our fellow-ministers in every
   place concerning Arius and his fellows, and especially since some of
   you, as the Presbyters Chares and Pistus [352] , and the Deacons
   Serapion, Parammon, Zosimus, and IrenÃ¦us, have joined Arius and his
   fellows, and been content to suffer deposition with them, I thought it
   needful to assemble together you, the Clergy of the city, and to send
   for you the Clergy of the Mareotis, in order that you may learn what I
   am now writing, and may testify your agreement thereto, and give your
   concurrence in the deposition of Arius, Pistus, and their fellows. For
   it is desirable that you should be made acquainted with what I write,
   and that each of you should heartily embrace it, as though he had
   written it himself.

   To his dearly beloved and most honoured fellow-ministers of the
   Catholic Church in every place, Alexander sends health in the Lord.

   1. As there is one body [353] of the Catholic Church, and a command is
   given us in the sacred Scriptures to preserve the bond of unity and
   peace, it is agreeable thereto that we should write and signify to one
   another whatever is done by each of us individually; so that whether
   one member suffer or rejoice, we may either suffer or rejoice with one
   another. Now there are gone forth in this diocese, at this time,
   certain lawless [354] men, enemies of Christ, teaching an apostasy,
   which one may justly suspect and designate as a forerunner [355] of
   Antichrist. I was desirous [356] to pass such a matter by without
   notice, in the hope that perhaps the evil would spend itself among its
   supporters, and not extend to other places to defile [357] the ears
   [358] of the simple [359] . But seeing that Eusebius, now of Nicomedia,
   who thinks that the government of the Church rests with him, because
   retribution has not come upon him for his desertion of Berytus, when he
   had cast an eye [360] of desire on the Church of the Nicomedians,
   begins to support these apostates, and has taken upon him to write
   letters every where in their behalf, if by any means he may draw in
   certain ignorant persons to this most base and antichristian heresy; I
   am therefore constrained, knowing what is written in the law, no longer
   to hold my peace, but to make it known to you all; that you may
   understand who the apostates are, and the cavils [361] which their
   heresy has adopted, and that, should Eusebius write to you, you may pay
   no attention to him, for he now desires by means of these men to
   exhibit anew his old malevolence [362] , which has so long been
   concealed, pretending to write in their favour, while in truth it
   clearly appears, that he does it to forward his own interests.

   2. Now those who became apostates are these, Arius, Achilles,
   Aeithales, Carpones, another Arius, and Sarmates, sometime Presbyters:
   EuzoÃ¯us, Lucius, Julius, Menas, Helladius, and Gaius, sometime Deacons:
   and with them Secundus and Theonas, sometime called Bishops. And the
   novelties they have invented and put forth contrary to the Scriptures
   are these following:--God was not always a Father [363] , but there was
   a time when God was not a Father. The Word of God was not always, but
   originated from things that were not; for God that is, has made him
   that was not, of that which was not; wherefore there was a time when He
   was not; for the Son is a creature and a work. Neither is He like in
   essence to the Father; neither is He the true and natural Word of the
   Father; neither is He His true Wisdom; but He is one of the things made
   and created, and is called the Word and Wisdom by an abuse of terms,
   since He Himself originated by the proper Word of God, and by the
   Wisdom that is in God, by which God has made not only all other things
   but Him also. Wherefore He is by nature subject to change and variation
   as are all rational creatures. And the Word is foreign from the essence
   [364] of the Father, and is alien and separated therefrom. And the
   Father cannot be described by the Son, for the Word does not know the
   Father perfectly and accurately, neither can He see Him perfectly.
   Moreover, the Son knows not His own essence as it really is; for He is
   made for us, that God might create us by Him, as by an instrument; and
   He would not have existed, had not God wished to create us.
   Accordingly, when some one asked them, whether the Word of God can
   possibly change as the devil changed, they were not afraid to say that
   He can; for being something made and created, His nature is subject to
   change.

   3. Now when Arius and his fellows made these assertions, and
   shamelessly avowed them, we being assembled with the Bishops of Egypt
   and Libya, nearly a hundred in number, anathematized both them and
   their followers. But Eusebius and his fellows admitted them to
   communion, being desirous to mingle falsehood with the truth, and
   impiety with piety. But they will not be able to do so, for the truth
   must prevail; neither is there any "communion of light with darkness,"
   nor any "concord of Christ with Belial [365] ." For who ever heard such
   assertions before [366] ? or who that hears them now is not astonished
   and does not stop his ears lest they should be defiled with such
   language? Who that has heard the words of John, "In the beginning was
   the Word [367] ," will not denounce the saying of these men, that
   "there was a time when He was not?" Or who that has heard in the
   Gospel, "the Only-begotten Son," and "by Him were all things made [368]
   ," will not detest their declaration that He is "one of the things that
   were made." For how can He be one of those things which were made by
   Himself? or how can He be the Only-begotten, when, according to them,
   He is counted as one among the rest, since He is Himself a creature and
   a work? And how can He be "made of things that were not," when the
   Father saith, "My heart hath uttered a good Word," and "Out of the womb
   I have begotten Thee before the morning star [369] ?" Or again, how is
   He "unlike in substance to the Father," seeing He is the perfect
   "image" and "brightness [370] " of the Father, and that He saith, "He
   that hath seen Me hath seen the Father [371] ?" And if the Son is the
   "Word" and "Wisdom" of God, how was there "a time when He was not?" It
   is the same as if they should say that God was once without Word and
   without Wisdom [372] . And how is He "subject to change and variation,"
   Who says, by Himself, "I am in the Father, and the Father in Me [373]
   ," and "I and the Father are One [374] ;" and by the Prophet, "Behold
   Me, for I am, and I change not [375] ?" For although one may refer this
   expression to the Father, yet it may now be more aptly spoken of the
   Word, viz., that though He has been made man, He has not changed; but
   as the Apostle has said, "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, to-day,
   and for ever." And who can have persuaded them to say, that He was made
   for us, whereas Paul writes, "for Whom are all things, and by Whom are
   all things [376] ?"

   4. As to their blasphemous position that "the Son knows not the Father
   perfectly," we ought not to wonder at it; for having once set
   themselves to fight against Christ, they contradict even His express
   words, since He says, "As the Father knoweth Me, even so know I the
   Father [377] ." Now if the Father knows the Son but in part, then it is
   evident that the Son does not know the Father perfectly; but if it is
   not lawful to say this, but the Father does know the Son perfectly,
   then it is evident that as the Father knows His own Word, so also the
   Word knows His own Father Whose Word He is.

   5. By these arguments and references to the sacred Scriptures we
   frequently overthrew them; but they changed like chameleons [378] , and
   again shifted their ground, striving to bring upon themselves that
   sentence, "when the wicked falleth into the depth of evils, he
   despiseth [379] ." There have been many heresies before them, which,
   venturing further than they ought, have fallen into folly; but these
   men by endeavouring in all their cavils to overthrow the Divinity of
   the Word, have justified the other in comparison of themselves, as
   approaching nearer to Antichrist. Wherefore they have been
   excommunicated and anathematized by the Church. We grieve for their
   destruction, and especially because, having once been instructed in the
   doctrines of the Church, they have now sprung away. Yet we are not
   greatly surprised, for HymenÃ¦us and Philetus [380] did the same, and
   before them Judas, who followed the Saviour, but afterwards became a
   traitor and an apostate. And concerning these same persons, we have not
   been left without instruction; for our Lord has forewarned us; "Take
   heed lest any man deceive you: for many shall come in My name, saying,
   I am Christ, and the time draweth near, and they shall deceive many: go
   ye not after them [381] ;" while Paul, who was taught these things by
   our Saviour, wrote that "in the latter times some shall depart from the
   sound faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils,
   which reject the truth [382] ."

   6. Since then our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ has instructed us by
   His own mouth, and also hath signified to us by the Apostle concerning
   such men, we accordingly being personal witnesses of their impiety,
   have anathematized, as we said, all such, and declared them to be alien
   from the Catholic Faith and Church. And we have made this known to your
   piety, dearly beloved and most honoured fellow-ministers, in order that
   should any of them have the boldness [383] to come unto you, you may
   not receive them, nor comply with the desire of Eusebius, or any other
   person writing in their behalf. For it becomes us who are Christians to
   turn away from all who speak or think any thing against Christ, as
   being enemies of God, and destroyers [384] of souls; and not even to
   "bid such God speed [385] ," lest we become partakers of their sins, as
   the blessed John hath charged us. Salute the brethren that are with
   you. They that are with me salute you.

   Epistola Eusebii.

   ------------------------

   Introduction.

   The letter which follows, addressed by Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea to his
   flock, upon the conclusion of the great Synod, is appended by
   Athanasius to his defense of the Definition of NicÃ¦a (de Decretis),
   written about a.d. 350. It is, however, inserted here in the present
   edition, partly in accordance with the chronological principle of
   arrangement, but principally because it forms the fittest introduction
   to the series of treatises which follow. Along with the account of
   Eustathius in Theodoret H. E. i. 8, and that given by Eusebius, in his
   life of Constantine (vol. I. pp. 521-526 of this series), it forms one
   of our most important authorities for the proceedings at NicÃ¦a, and the
   only account we have dating from the actual year of the Council. It is
   especially important as containing the draft Creed submitted to the
   Council by Eusebius, and the revised form of it eventually adopted. The
   former, which contained (in the first paragraph of Â§3, from We believe'
   down to One Holy Ghost') the traditional Creed of the Church of
   CÃ¦sarea, which Eusebius had professed at his baptism, was laid by him
   before the Council, and approved: but at the Emperor's suggestion the
   single word homoousion was inserted (not by the majority' as distinct
   from the Emperor, as stated by Swainson, Creeds, p. 65). This
   modification opened the door for others, which eventually resulted in
   the Creed given in Â§4. It is not altogether easy to reconcile this
   account with that given by Athanasius himself (below de Decr. 19, 20,
   Ad Afr. 5), according to which the Council were led to insist on the
   insertion of the homoousion by the evasions with which the Arian
   bishops met every other test that was propounded, signalling to each
   other by nods winks and gestures, as each Scriptural attribute of the
   Son was enumerated, that this also could be accepted in an Arian sense.
   Probably (see Prolegg. ch. ii. Â§3 (1) note 5) the discussions thus
   described came first (cp. Sozom. i. 17): then Eusebius of Nicomedia
   presented the document which was indignantly torn up: then came the
   Confession of Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea, which was adopted as the basis of
   the Creed finally issued. In any case the Emperor's suggestion of the
   insertion of homoousion must have been prompted by others, most likely
   by Hosius (Hist. Ar. 42, Cf. Hort, Two Dissertations, p. 58. Gwatkin,
   Studies, pp. 44, 45, puts the scene described by Athanasius during the
   debate upon the final adoption of the Creed).

   The translation which follows, with the notes and Excursus A, is the
   unaltered work of Newman (Library of the Fathers, vol. 8, pp. 59-72),
   except that the word essence' (for ousia), as throughout this volume,
   has been substituted for substance,' and the translation of genetos by
   generate' altered wherever it occurs, as explained in the preface.
   Additions by the editor of this volume are here as elsewhere included
   in square brackets.

   Council of NicÃ¦a.

   ------------------------

   Letter of Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea to the people of his Diocese [413] .

   1. What was transacted concerning ecclesiastical faith at the Great
   Council assembled at NicÃ¦a, you have probably learned, Beloved, from
   other sources, rumour being wont to precede the accurate account of
   what is doing. But lest in such reports the circumstances of the case
   have been misrepresented, we have been obliged to transmit to you,
   first, the formula of faith presented by ourselves, and next, the
   second, which [the Fathers] put forth with some additions to our words.
   Our own paper, then, which was read in the presence of our most pious
   [414] Emperor, and declared to be good and unexceptionable, ran thus:--

   2. "As we have received from the Bishops who preceded us, and in our
   first catechisings, and when we received the Holy Laver, and as we have
   learned from the divine Scriptures, and as we believed and taught in
   the presbytery, and in the Episcopate itself, so believing also at the
   time present, we report to you our faith, and it is this [415] :"--

   3. "We believe in One God, the Father Almighty, the Maker of all things
   visible and invisible. And in One Lord Jesus Christ, the Word of God,
   God from God, Light from Light, Life from Life, Son Only-begotten,
   first-born of every creature, before all the ages, begotten from the
   Father, by Whom also all things were made; Who for our salvation was
   made flesh, and lived among men, and suffered, and rose again the third
   day, and ascended to the Father, and will come again in glory to judge
   the quick and dead. And we believe also in One Holy Ghost:"

   "believing each of these to be and to exist, the Father truly Father,
   and the Son truly Son, and the Holy Ghost truly Holy Ghost, as also our
   Lord, sending forth His disciples for the preaching, said, "Go teach
   all nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father and of the Son,
   and of the Holy Ghost [416] ." Concerning Whom we confidently affirm
   that so we hold, and so we think, and so we have held aforetime, and we
   maintain this faith unto the death, anathematizing every godless
   heresy. That this we have ever thought from our heart and soul, from
   the time we recollect ourselves, and now think and say in truth, before
   God Almighty and our Lord Jesus Christ do we witness, being able by
   proofs to shew and to convince you, that, even in times past, such has
   been our belief and preaching."

   4. On this faith being publicly put forth by us, no room for
   contradiction appeared; but our most pious Emperor, before any one
   else, testified that it comprised most orthodox statements. He
   confessed moreover that such were his own sentiments, and he advised
   all present to agree to it, and to subscribe its articles and to assent
   to them, with the insertion of the single word, One-in-essence, which
   moreover he interpreted as not in the sense of the affections of
   bodies, nor as if the Son subsisted from the Father in the way of
   division, or any severance; for that the immaterial, and intellectual,
   and incorporeal nature could not be the subject of any corporeal
   affection, but that it became us to conceive of such things in a divine
   and ineffable manner. And such were the theological remarks of our most
   wise and most religious Emperor; but they, with a view [417] to the
   addition of One in essence, drew up the following formula:--

   The Faith dictated in the Council.

   "We believe in One God, the Father Almighty, Maker of all things
   visible and invisible:"--

   "And in One Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, begotten of the Father,
   Only-begotten, that is, from the essence of the Father; God from God,
   Light from Light, Very God from Very God, begotten not made, One in
   essence with the Father, by Whom all things were made, both things in
   heaven and things in earth; Who for us men and for our salvation came
   down and was made flesh, was made man, suffered, and rose again the
   third day, ascended into heaven, and cometh to judge quick and dead."

   "And in the Holy Ghost."

   "And those who say, Once He was not,' and Before His generation He was
   not,' and He came to be from nothing,' or those who pretend that the
   Son of God is Of other subsistence or essence [418] ,' or created' or
   alterable,' or mutable,' the Catholic Church anathematizes."

   5. On their dictating this formula, we did not let it pass without
   inquiry in what sense they introduced "of the essence of the Father,"
   and "one in essence with the Father." Accordingly questions and
   explanations took place, and the meaning of the words underwent the
   scrutiny of reason. And they professed, that the phrase "of the
   essence" was indicative of the Son's being indeed from the Father, yet
   without being as if a part of Him. And with this understanding we
   thought good to assent to the sense of such religious doctrine,
   teaching, as it did, that the Son was from the Father, not however a
   part of His essence [419] . On this account we assented to the sense
   ourselves, without declining even the term "One in essence," peace
   being the object which we set before us, and stedfastness in the
   orthodox view.

   6. In the same way we also admitted "begotten, not made;" since the
   Council alleged that "made" was an appellative common to the other
   creatures which came to be through the Son, to whom the Son had no
   likeness. Wherefore, say they, He was not a work resembling the things
   which through Him came to be [420] , but was of an essence which is too
   high for the level of any work; and which the Divine oracles teach to
   have been generated from the Father [421] , the mode of generation
   being inscrutable and incalculable to every originated nature.

   7. And so too on examination there are grounds for saying that the Son
   is "one in essence" with the Father; not in the way of bodies, nor like
   mortal beings, for He is not such by division of essence, or by
   severance, no, nor by any affection, or alteration, or changing of the
   Father's essence and power [422] (since from all such the unoriginate
   nature of the Father is alien), but because "one in essence with the
   Father" suggests that the Son of God bears no resemblance to the
   originated creatures, but that to His Father alone Who begat Him is He
   in every way assimilated, and that He is not of any other subsistence
   and essence, but from the Father [423] . To which term also, thus
   interpreted, it appeared well to assent; since we were aware that even
   among the ancients, some learned and illustrious Bishops and writers
   [424] have used the term "one in essence," in their theological
   teaching concerning the Father and Son.

   8. So much then be said concerning the faith which was published; to
   which all of us assented, not without inquiry, but according to the
   specified senses, mentioned before the most religious Emperor himself,
   and justified by the forementioned considerations. And as to the
   anathematism published by them at the end of the Faith, it did not pain
   us, because it forbade to use words not in Scripture, from which almost
   all the confusion and disorder of the Church have come. Since then no
   divinely inspired Scripture has used the phrases, "out of nothing," and
   "once He was not," and the rest which follow, there appeared no ground
   for using or teaching them; to which also we assented as a good
   decision, since it had not been our custom hitherto to use these terms.

   9. Moreover to anathematize "Before His generation He was not," did not
   seem preposterous, in that it is confessed by all, that the Son of God
   was before the generation according to the flesh [425] .

   10. Nay, our most religious Emperor did at the time prove, in a speech,
   that He was in being even according to His divine generation which is
   before all ages, since even before He was generated in energy, He was
   in virtue [426] with the Father ingenerately, the Father being always
   Father, as King always, and Saviour always, being all things in virtue,
   and being always in the same respects and in the same way.

   11. This we have been forced to transmit to you, Beloved, as making
   clear to you the deliberation of our inquiry and assent, and how
   reasonably we resisted even to the last minute as long as we were
   offended at statements which differed from our own, but received
   without contention what no longer pained us, as soon as, on a candid
   examination of the sense of the words, they appeared to us to coincide
   with what we ourselves have professed in the faith which we have
   already published.

   ibid. "most religious," Â§8. Â§10. Eusebius observes in his Vit. Const.
   the same tone concerning Constantine, and assigns to him the same
   office in determining the faith (being as yet unbaptized). E.g. "When
   there were differences between persons of different countries, as if
   some common bishop appointed by God, he convened Councils of God's
   ministers; and not disdaining to be present and to sit amid their
   conferences," &c. i. 44. When he came into the Nicene Council, "it
   was," says Eusebius, "as some heavenly Angel of God," iii. 10. alluding
   to the brilliancy of the imperial purple. He confesses, however, he did
   not sit down until the Bishops bade him. Again at the same Council,
   "with pleasant eyes looking serenity itself into them all, collecting
   himself, and in a quiet and gentle voice" he made an oration to the
   Fathers upon peace. Constantine had been an instrument in conferring
   such vast benefits, humanly speaking, on the Christian Body, that it is
   not wonderful that other writers of the day besides Eusebius should
   praise him. Hilary speaks of him as "of sacred memory," Fragm. v. init.
   Athanasius calls him "most pious," Apol. contr. Arian. 9; "of blessed
   memory," ad Ep. Ã†g. 18. 19. Epiphanius "most religious and of
   ever-blessed memory," HÃ¦r. 70. 9. Posterity, as was natural, was still
   more grateful.

   [415] "The children of the Church have received from their holy
   Fathers, that is, the holy Apostles, to guard the faith; and withal to
   deliver and preach it to their own children....Cease not, faithful and
   orthodox men, thus to speak, and to teach the like from the divine
   Scriptures, and to walk, and to catechise, to the confirmation of
   yourselves and those who hear you; namely, that holy faith of the
   Catholic Church, as the holy and only Virgin of God received its
   custody from the holy Apostles of the Lord; and thus, in the case of
   each of those who are under catechising, who are to approach the Holy
   Laver, ye ought not only to preach faith to your children in the Lord,
   but also to teach them expressly, as your common mother teaches, to
   say: We believe in One God,'" &c. Epiph. Ancor. 119 fin., who thereupon
   proceeds to give at length the [so-called] Constantinopolitan Creed.
   And so Athan. speaks of the orthodox faith, as "issuing from
   Apostolical teaching and the Fathers' traditions, and confirmed by New
   and Old Testament." Letter 60. 6. init. Cyril Hier. too as "declared by
   the Church and established from all Scripture." Cat. v. 12. "Let us
   guard with vigilance what we have received...What then have we received
   from the Scriptures but altogether this? that God made the world by the
   Word," &c., &c. Procl. ad Armen. p. 612. "That God, the Word, after the
   union remained such as He was, &c., so clearly hath divine Scripture,
   and moreover the doctors of the Churches, and the lights of the world
   taught us." Theodor. Dial. 3 init. "That it is the tradition of the
   Fathers is not the whole of our case; for they too followed the meaning
   of Scripture, starting from the testimonies, which just now we laid
   before you from Scripture." Basil de Sp. Â§16. vid. also a remarkable
   passage in de Synod. Â§6 fin. infra.

   [416] Matt. xxviii. 19.

   [417] [Or, taking the addition as their pretext.']

   [418] The only clauses of the Creed which admit of any question in
   their explanation, are the "He was not before His generation," and "of
   other subsistence or essence." Of these the former shall be reserved
   for a later part of the volume; the latter is treated of in a note at
   the end of this Treatise [see Excursus A.].

   [419] Eusebius does not commit himself to any positive sense in which
   the formula "of the essence" is to be interpreted, but only says what
   it does not mean. His comment on it is "of the Father, but not as a
   part;" where, what is not negative, instead of being an explanation, is
   but a recurrence to the original words of Scripture, of which ex ousias
   itself is the explanation; a curious inversion. Indeed it is very
   doubtful whether he admitted the ex ousias at all. He says, that the
   Son is not like the radiance of light so far as this, that the radiance
   is an inseparable accident of substance, whereas the Son is by the
   Father's will, kata gnomen kai proairesin, Demonstr. Ev. iv. 3. And
   though he insists on our Lord being alone, ek theou, yet he means in
   the sense which Athan. refutes, supr. Â§6, viz. that He alone was
   created immediately from God, vid. next note 6. It is true that he
   plainly condemns with the Nicene Creed the ex ouk onton of the Arians,
   "out of nothing," but an evasion was at hand here also; for he not only
   adds, according to Arian custom, "as others" (vid. note following) but
   he has a theory that no being whatever is out of nothing, for
   non-existence cannot be the cause of existence. God, he says, "proposed
   His own will and power as a sort of matter and substance' of the
   production and constitution of the universe, so that it is not
   reasonably said, that any thing is out of nothing. For what is from
   nothing cannot be at all. How indeed can nothing be to any thing a
   cause of being? but all that is, takes its being from One who only is,
   and was, who also said I am that I am.'" Demonstr. Ev. iv. 1. Again,
   speaking of our Lord, "He who was from nothing would not truly be Son
   of God, as neither is any other of things generate.'" Eccl. Theol. i. 9
   fin. [see, however, D.C.B. ii. p. 347].

   [420] Eusebius distinctly asserts, Dem. Ev. iv. 2, that our Lord is a
   creature. "This offspring," he says, "did He first produce Himself from
   Himself as a foundation of those things which should succeed, the
   perfect handy-work, demiourgema, of the Perfect, and the wise
   structure, architektonema, of the Wise," &c. Accordingly his avowal in
   the text is but the ordinary Arian evasion of "an offspring, not as the
   offsprings." E.g. "It is not without peril to say recklessly that the
   Son is originate out of nothing similarly to the other things
   originate.'" Dem. Ev. v. 1. vid. also Eccl. Theol. i. 9. iii. 2. And he
   considers our Lord the only Son by a divine provision similar to that
   by which there is only one sun in the firmament, as a centre of light
   and heat. "Such an Only-begotten Son, the excellent artificer of His
   will and operator, did the supreme God and Father of that operator
   Himself first of all beget, through Him and in Him giving subsistence
   to the operative words (ideas or causes) of things which were to be,
   and casting in Him the seeds of the constitution and governance of the
   universe;...Therefore the Father being One, it behoved the Son to be
   one also; but should any one object that He constituted not more, it is
   fitting for such a one to complain that He constituted not more suns,
   and moons, and worlds, and ten thousand other things." Dem. Ev. iv. 5
   fin. vid. also iv. 6.

   [421] Eusebius does not say that our Lord is "from the essence of" the
   Father, but has "an essence from" the Father. This is the Semi-arian
   doctrine, which, whether confessing the Son from the essence of the
   Father or not, implied that His essence was not the Father's essence,
   but a second essence. The same doctrine is found in the Semi-arians of
   Ancyra, though they seem to have confessed "of the essence." And this
   is one object of the homoousion, to hinder the confession "of the
   essence" from implying a second essence, which was not obviated or was
   even encouraged by the homoiousion. The Council of Ancyra, quoting the
   text "As the Father hath life in Himself so," &c., says, "since the
   life which is in the Father means essence, and the life of the
   Only-begotten which is begotten from the Father means essence, the word
   so' implies a likeness of essence to essence." HÃ¦r. 73. 10 fin. Hence
   Eusebius does not scruple to speak of "two essences," and other writers
   of three essences, contr. Marc. i. 4. p. 25. He calls our Lord "a
   second essence." Dem. Ev. vi. PrÃ¦f. PrÃ¦p. Ev. vii. 12. p. 320, and the
   Holy Spirit a third essence, ibid. 15. p. 325. This it was that made
   the Latins so suspicions of three hypostases, because the Semi-arians,
   as well as they, understood hupostasis to mean essence [but this is
   dubious]. Eusebius in like manner [after Origen] calls our Lord
   "another God," "a second God." Dem. Ev. v. 4. p. 226. v. fin. "second
   Lord." ibid. 3 init. 6. fin. "second cause." Dem. Ev. v. PrÃ¦f. vid.
   also heteron echousa to kat' ousian hupokeimenon, Dem. Ev. v. 1. p.
   215. kath' heauton ousiomenos. ibid. iv. 3. And so heteros para ton
   patera. Eccl. Theol. i. 60. p. 90. and zoen idian echon. ibid. and zon
   kai huphestos kai tou patros huparchon ektos. ibid. Hence Athan.
   insists so much, as in de Decr., on our Lord not being external to the
   Father. Once admit that He is in the Father, and we may call the
   Father, the only God, for He is included. And so again as to the
   Ingenerate, the term does not exclude the Son, for He is generate in
   the Ingenerate.

   [422] This was the point on which the Semi-arians made their principal
   stand against the "one in essence," though they also objected to it as
   being of a Sabellian character. E.g. Euseb. Demonstr. iv. 3. p. 148.
   d.p. 149. a, b. v. 1. pp. 213-215. contr. Marcell. i. 4. p. 20. Eccl.
   Theol. i. 12. p. 73. in laud. Const. p. 525. de Fide i. ap. Sirmond.
   tom. i. p. 7. de Fide ii. p. 16, and apparently his de Incorporali. And
   so the Semi-arians at Ancyra Epiph. HÃ¦r. 73. 11. p. 858. a, b. And so
   Meletius ibid. p. 878 fin. and Cyril Hier. Catech. vii. 5. xi. 18.
   though of course Catholics would speak as strongly on this point as
   their opponents.

   [423] Here again Eusebius does not say "from the Father's essence," but
   "not from other essence, but from the Father." According to note 5,
   supr. he considered the will of God a certain matter or substance.
   Montfaucon in loc. and Collect. Nov. PrÃ¦f. p. xxvi. translates without
   warrant "ex Patris hypostasi et substantiÃ¢." As to the Son's perfect
   likeness to the Father which he seems here to grant, it has been
   already shewn, de Decr. 20, note 9, how the admission was evaded. The
   likeness was but a likeness after its own kind, as a picture is of the
   original. "Though our Saviour Himself teaches," he says, "that the
   Father is the only true God,' still let me not be backward to confess
   Him also the true God, as in an image,' and that possessed; so that the
   addition of only' may belong to the Father alone as archetype of the
   image....As, supposing one king held sway, and his image was carried
   about into every quarter, no one in his right mind would say that those
   who held sway were two, but one who was honoured through his image; in
   like manner," &c. de Eccles. Theol. ii. 23, vid. ibid. 7.

   [424] Athanasius in like manner, ad Afros. 6. speaks of "testimony of
   ancient Bishops about 130 years since;" and in de Syn. Â§43. of "long
   before" the Council of Antioch, a.d. 269. viz. the Dionysii, &c. vid.
   note on de Decr. 20.

   [425] Socrates, who advocates the orthodoxy of Eusebius, leaves out
   this heterodox paragraph [Â§Â§9, 10] altogether. Bull, however, Defens.
   F. N. iii. 9. n. 3. thinks it an interpolation. Athanasius alludes to
   the early part of the clause, supr. Â§4. and de Syn. Â§13. where he says,
   that Eusebius implied that the Arians denied even our Lord's existence
   before His incarnation. As to Constantine, he seems to have been used
   on these occasions by the court Bishops who were his instructors, and
   who made him the organ of their own heresy. Upon the first rise of the
   Arian controversy he addressed a sort of pastoral letter to Alexander
   and Arius, telling them that they were disputing about a question of
   words, and recommending them to drop it and live together peaceably.
   Euseb. vit. C. ii. 69. 72.

   [426] [Rather potentially' both here and three lines below.] Theognis,
   [one] of the Nicene Arians, says the same, according to Philostorgius;
   viz. "that God even before He begat the Son was a Father, as having the
   power, dunamis, of begetting." Hist. ii. 15. Though Bull pronounces
   such doctrine to be heretical, as of course it is, still he considers
   that it expresses what otherwise stated may be orthodox, viz. the
   doctrine that our Lord was called the Word from eternity, and the Son
   upon His descent to create the worlds. And he acutely and ingeniously
   interprets the Arian formula, "Before His generation He was not," to
   support this view. Another opportunity will occur of giving an opinion
   upon this question; meanwhile, the parallel on which the heretical
   doctrine is supported in the text is answered by many writers, on the
   ground that Father and Son are words of nature, but Creator, King,
   Saviour, are external, or what may be called accidental to Him. Thus
   Athanasius observes, that Father actually implies Son, but Creator only
   the power to create, as expressing a dunamis; "a maker is before his
   works, but he who says Father, forthwith in Father implies the
   existence of the Son." Orat. iii. Â§6. vid. Cyril too, Dial. ii. p. 459.
   Pseudo-Basil, contr. Eun. iv. 1. fin. On the other hand Origen argues
   the reverse way, that since God is eternally a Father, therefore
   eternally Creator also: "As one cannot be father without a son, nor
   lord without possession, so neither can God be called All-powerful,
   without subjects of His power;" de Princ. i. 2. n. 10. hence he argued
   for the eternity of matter.

   Excursus [427] A.

   ------------------------

   On the meaning of the phrase ex heteras hupostaseos e ousias in the
   Nicene Anathema.

   Bishop Bull has made it a question, whether these words in the Nicene
   Creed mean the same thing, or are to be considered distinct from each
   other, advocating himself the latter opinion against Petavius. The
   history of the word hupostasis is of too intricate a character to enter
   upon here; but a few words may be in place in illustration of its sense
   as it occurs in the Creed, and with reference to the view taken of it
   by the great divine, who has commented on it.

   Bishop Bull, as I understood him (Defens. F. N. ii. 9. Â§11.), considers
   that two distinct ideas are intended by the words ousia and hupostasis,
   in the clause ex heteras hupostaseos e ousias; as if the Creed
   condemned those who said that the Son was not from the Father's
   essence, and those also who said that He was not from the Father's
   hypostasis or subsistence; as if a man might hold at least one of the
   two without holding the other. And in matter of fact, he does profess
   to assign two parties of heretics, who denied this or that proposition
   respectively.

   Petavius, on the other hand (de Trin. iv. I.), considers that the word
   hupostasis is but another term for ousia, and that not two but one
   proposition is contained in the clause in question; the word hupostasis
   not being publicly recognised in its present meaning till the Council
   of Alexandria, in the year 362. Coustant. (Epist. Pont. Rom. pp. 274.
   290. 462.) Tillemont (Memoires S. Denys. d'Alex. Â§15.), Huet
   (Origenian. ii. 2. n. 3.), Thomassin (de Incarn. iii. 1.), and Morinus
   (de Sacr. Ordin. ii. 6.), take substantially the same view; while
   Maranus (PrÃ¦f. ad S. Basil. Â§1. tom. 3. ed. Bened.), Natalis Alexander,
   Hist. (SÃ¦c. 1. Diss. 22. circ. fin.), Burton (Testimonies to the
   Trinity, No. 71), and [Routh] (Reliqu. Sacr. vol. iii. p. 189.), differ
   from Petavius, if they do not agree with Bull.

   Bull's principal argument lies in the strong fact, that S. Basil
   expressly asserts, that the Council did mean the two terms to be
   distinct, and this when he is answering the Sabellians, who grounded
   their assertion that there was but one hupostasis, on the alleged fact
   that the Council had used ousia and hupostasis indifferently.

   Bull refers also to Anastasius Hodeg. 21. (22. p. 343.?) who says, that
   the Nicene Fathers defined that there are three hypostases or Persons
   in the Holy Trinity. Petavius considers that he derived this from
   Gelasius of Cyzicus, a writer of no great authority; but, as the
   passage occurs in Anastasius, they are the words of Andrew of Samosata.
   But what is more important, elsewhere Anastasius quotes a passage from
   Amphilochius to something of the same effect. c. 10. p. 164. He states
   it besides himself, c. 9. p. 150. and c. 24. p. 364. In addition, Bull
   quotes passages from S. Dionysius of Alexandria, S. Dionysius of Rome
   (vid. below, de Decr. 25-27 and notes), Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea, and
   afterwards Origen; in all of which three hypostases being spoken of,
   whereas antiquity, early or late, never speaks in the same way of three
   ousiai, it is plain that hupostasis then conveyed an idea which ousia
   did not. To these may be added a passage in Athanasius, in Illud,
   Omnia, Â§6.

   Bishop Bull adds the following explanation of the two words as they
   occur in the Creed: he conceives that the one is intended to reach the
   Arians, and the other the Semi-arians; that the Semi-arians did
   actually make a distinction between ousia and hupostasis, admitting in
   a certain sense that the Son was from the hupostasis of the Father,
   while they denied that He was from His ousia. They then are
   anathematized in the words ex heteras ousias; and, as he would seem to
   mean, the Arians in the ex heteras hupostaseos.

   Now I hope it will not be considered any disrespect to so great an
   authority, if I differ from this view, and express my reasons for doing
   so.

   1. First then, supposing his account of the Semi-arian doctrine ever so
   free from objection, granting that they denied the ex ousias, and
   admitted the ex hupostaseos, yet who are they who, according to his
   view, denied the ex hupostaseos, or said that the Son was ex heteras
   hupostaseos? he does not assign any parties, though he implies the
   Arians. Yet though, as is notorious, they denied the ex ousias, there
   is nothing to shew that they or any other party of Arians maintained
   specifically that the Son was not [from] the hupostasis, or subsistence
   of the Father. That is, the hypothesis supported by this eminent divine
   does not answer the very question which it raises. It professes that
   those who denied the ex hupostaseos, were not the same as those who
   denied the ex ousias; yet it fails to tell us who did deny the ex
   hupostaseos, in a sense distinct from ex ousias.

   2. Next, his only proof that the Semi-arians did hold the ex
   hupostaseos as distinct from the ex ousias, lies in the circumstance,
   that the three (commonly called) Semi-arian confessions of a.d. 341,
   344, 351, known as Mark's of Arethusa [i.e. the fourth Antiochene'],
   the Macrostich, and the first Sirmian, anathematize those who say that
   the Son is ex heteras hupostaseos, not anathematizing the kai me ek tou
   theou, which he thence infers was their own belief. Another explanation
   of this passage will be offered presently; meanwhile, it is well to
   observe, that Hilary, in speaking of the confession of Philippopolis
   which was taken from Mark's, far from suspecting that the clause
   involved an omission, defends it on the ground of its retaining the
   Anathema (de Synod. 35.), thus implying that ex heteras hupostaseos kai
   me ek tou theou was equivalent to ex heteras hupostaseos e ousias. And
   it may be added, that Athanasius in like manner, in his account of the
   Nicene Council (de Decret. Â§20. fin.), when repeating its anathema,
   drops the ex hupostaseos altogether, and reads tous de legontas ex ouk
   onton,....e poiema, e ex heteras ousias, toutous anathematizei k. t. l.

   3. Further, Bull gives us no proof whatever that the Semi-arians did
   deny the ex ousias; while it is very clear, if it is right to
   contradict so great a writer, that most of them did not deny it. He
   says that it is "certissimum" that the heretics who wrote the three
   confessions above noticed, that is, the Semi-arians, "nunquam fassos,
   nunquam fassuros fuisse filium ex ousias, e substantia, Patris
   progenitum." His reason for not offering any proof for this naturally
   is, that Petavius, with whom he is in controversy, maintains it also,
   and he makes use of Petavius's admission against himself. Now it may
   seem bold in a writer of this day to differ not only with Bull, but
   with Petavius; but the reason for doing so is simple; it is because
   Athanasius asserts the very thing which Petavius and Bull deny, and
   Petavius admits that he does; that is, he allows it by implication when
   he complains that Athanasius had not got to the bottom of the doctrine
   of the Semi-arians, and thought too favourably of them. "Horum
   Semi-arianorum, quorum antesignanus fuit Basilius AncyrÃ¦ episcopus,
   prorsus obscura fuit hÃ¦resis.....ut ne ipse quidem Athanasius satis
   illam exploratam habuerit." de Trin. i. x. Â§7.

   Now S. Athanasius's words are most distinct and express; "As to those
   who receive all else that was defined at NicÃ¦a, but dispute about the
   One in essence' only, we must not feel as towards enemies....for, as
   confessing that the Son is from the essence of the Father and not of
   other subsistence, ek tes ousias tou patros einai, kai me ex heteras
   hupostaseos ton huion,...they are not far from receiving the phrase One
   in essence' also. Such is Basil of Ancyra, in what he has written about
   the faith" de Syn. Â§41;--a passage, not only express for the matter in
   hand, but remarkable too, as apparently using hupostasis and ousia as
   synonymous, which is the main point which Bull denies. What follows in
   Athanasius is equally to the purpose: he urges the Semi-arians to
   accept the homoousion, in consistency, because they maintain the ex
   ousias and the homoiousion would not sufficiently secure it.

   Moreover Hilary, while defending the Semi-arian decrees of Ancyra or
   Sirmium, says expressly, that according to them, among other truths,
   "non creatura est Filius genitus, sed a natura Patris indiscreta
   substantia est." de Syn. 27.

   Petavius, however, in the passage to which Bull appeals, refers in
   proof of this view of Semi-arianism, to those Ancyrene documents, which
   Epiphanius has preserved, HÃ¦r. 73. and which he considers to shew, that
   according to the Semi-arians the Son was not ex ousias tou patros. He
   says, that it is plain from their own explanations that they considered
   our Lord to be, not ek tes ousias, but ek tes homoiotetos (he does not
   say hupostaseos, as Bull wishes) tou patros and that, energei& 139;
   gennetike, which was one of the divine energeiai, as creation, he
   ktistike, was another. Yet surely Epiphanius does not bear out this
   representation better than Athanasius; since the Semi-arians, whose
   words he reports, speak of "hui& 232;n homoion kai kat' ousian ek tou
   patros, p. 825 b, hos he sophia tou sophou hui& 232;s, ousia ousias, p.
   853 c, kat' ousian hui& 232;n tou Theou kai patros, p. 854 c, exousi&
   139; homou kai ousi& 139; patros monogenous huiou. p. 858 d, besides
   the strong word gnesios, ibid. and Athan. de Syn. Â§41. not to insist on
   other of their statements.

   The same fact is brought before us even in a more striking way in the
   conference at Constantinople, a.d. 360, before Constantius, between the
   Anomoeans and Semi-arians, where the latter, according to Theodoret,
   shew no unwillingness to acknowledge even the homoousion, because they
   acknowledge the ex ousias. When the Anomoeans wished the former
   condemned, Silvanus of Tarsus said, "If God the Word be not out of
   nothing, nor a creature, nor of other essence, ousias, therefore is He
   one in essence, homoousios, with God who begot Him, as God from God,
   and Light from Light, and He has the same nature with His Father." H.
   E. ii. 23. Here again it is observable, as in the passage from
   Athanasius above, that, while apparently reciting the Nicene Anathema,
   he omits ex heteras hupostaseos, as if it were superfluous to mention a
   synonym.

   At the same time there certainly is reason to suspect that the
   Semi-arians approximated towards orthodoxy as time went on; and perhaps
   it is hardly fair to determine what they held at NicÃ¦a by their
   statements at Ancyra, though to the latter Petavius appeals. Several of
   the most eminent among them, as Meletius, Cyril, and Eusebius of
   Samosata conformed soon after; on the other hand in Eusebius, who is
   their representative at NicÃ¦a, it will perhaps be difficult to find a
   clear admission of the ex ousias. But at any rate he does not maintain
   the ex hupostaseos, which Bull's theory requires.

   On various grounds then, because the Semi-arians as a body did not deny
   the ex ousias, nor confess the ex hupostaseos, nor the Arians deny it,
   there is reason for declining Bishop Bull's explanation of these words
   as they occur in the Creed; and now let us turn to the consideration of
   the authorities on which that explanation rests.

   As to Gelasius, Bull himself does not insist upon his testimony, and
   Anastasius [about 700 a.d.] is too late to be of authority. The passage
   indeed which he quotes from Amphilochius is important, but as he was a
   friend of S. Basil, perhaps it does not very much increase the weight
   of S. Basil's more distinct and detailed testimony to the same point,
   and no one can say that that weight is inconsiderable.

   Yet there is evidence the other way which overbalances it. Bull, who
   complains of Petavius's rejection of S. Basil's testimony concerning a
   Council which was held before his birth, cannot maintain his own
   explanation of its Creed without rejecting Athanasius's testimony
   respecting the doctrine of his contemporaries, the Semi-arians; and
   moreover the more direct evidence, as we shall see, of the Council of
   Alexandria, a.d. 362, S. Jerome, Basil of Ancyra, and Socrates.

   First, however, no better comment upon the sense of the Council can be
   required than the incidental language of Athanasius and others, who in
   a foregoing extract exchanges ousia for hupostasis in a way which is
   natural only on the supposition that he used them as synonyms.
   Elsewhere, as we have seen, he omits the word e hupostaseos in the
   Nicene Anathema, while Hilary considers the Anathema sufficient with
   that omission.

   In like manner Hilary expressly translates the clause in the Creed by
   ex altera substantia vel essentia. Fragm. ii. 27. And somewhat in the
   same way Eusebius says in his letter, ex heteras tinos hupostaseos te
   kai ousias.

   But further, Athanasius says expressly, ad Afros,--"Hypostasis is
   essence, ousia, and means nothing else than simply being, which
   Jeremiah calls existence when he says," &c. Â§4. It is true, he
   elsewhere speaks of three Hypostases, but this only shews that he
   attached no fixed sense to the word. [Rather, he abandons the latter
   usage in his middle and later writings.] This is just what I would
   maintain; its sense must be determined by the context; and, whereas it
   always stands in all Catholic writers for the Una Res (as the 4th
   Lateran speaks), which ousia denotes, when Athanasius says, "three
   hypostases," he takes the word to mean ousia in that particular sense
   in which it is three, and when he makes it synonymous with ousia, he
   uses it to signify Almighty God in that sense in which He is one.

   Leaving Athanasius, we have the following evidence concerning the
   history of the word hupostasis. S. Jerome says, "The whole school of
   secular learning understanding nothing else by hypostasis than usia,
   essence," Ep. xv. 4, where, speaking of the Three Hypostases he uses
   the strong language, "If you desire it, then be a new faith framed
   after the Nicene, and let the orthodox confess in terms like the
   Arian."

   In like manner, Basil of Ancyra, George, and the other Semi-arians, say
   distinctly, "This hypostasis our Fathers called essence," ousia. Epiph.
   HÃ¦r. 74. 12. fin.; in accordance with which is the unauthorized
   addition to the Sardican Epistle, "hupostasin, hen autoi hoi hairetikoi
   ousian prosagoreuousi." Theod. H. E. ii. 6.

   If it be said that Jerome from his Roman connection, and Basil and
   George as Semi-arians, would be led by their respective theologies for
   distinct reasons thus to speak, it is true, and may have led them to
   too broad a statement of the fact; but then on the other hand it was in
   accordance also with the theology of S. Basil, so strenuous a defender
   of the formula of the Three Hypostases, to suppose that the Nicene
   Fathers meant to distinguish hupostasis from ousia in their anathema.

   Again, Socrates informs us that, though there was some dispute about
   hypostasis at Alexandria shortly before the Nicene Council, yet the
   Council itself "devoted not a word to the question," H. E. iii. 7.;
   which hardly consists with its having intended to rule that ex heteras
   hupostaseos was distinct from ex heteras ousias.

   And in like manner the Council of Alexandria, a.d. 362, in deciding
   that the sense of Hypostasis was an open question, not only from the
   very nature of the case goes on the supposition that the Nicene Council
   had not closed it, but says so in words again and again in its Synodal
   Letter. If the Nicene Council had already used "hypostasis" in its
   present sense, what remained to Athanasius at Alexandria but to submit
   to it?

   Indeed the history of this Council is perhaps the strongest argument
   against the supposed discrimination of the two terms by the Council of
   NicÃ¦a. Bull can only meet it by considering that an innovation upon the
   "veterem vocabuli usum" began at the date of the Council of Sardica,
   though Socrates mentions the dispute as existing at Alexandria before
   the Nicene Council, H. E. iii. 4. 5. while the supposititious
   confession of Sardica professes to have received the doctrine of the
   one hypostasis by tradition as Catholic.

   Nor is the use of the word in earlier times inconsistent with these
   testimonies; though it occurs so seldom, in spite of its being a word
   of S. Paul [i.e. Heb. i. 3], that testimony is our principal evidence.
   Socrates' remarks deserve to be quoted; "Those among the Greeks who
   have treated of the Greek philosophy, have defined essence, ousia, in
   many ways, but they had made no mention at all of hypostasis. IrenÃ¦us
   the Grammarian, in his alphabetical Atticist, even calls the term
   barbarous; because it is not used by any of the ancients, and if
   anywhere found, it does not mean what it is now taken for. Thus in the
   Phoenix of Sophocles it means an ambush;' but in Menander, preserves,'
   as if one were to call the wine-lees in a cask hypostasis.' However it
   must be observed, that, in spite of the old philosophers being silent
   about the term, the more modern continually use it for essence, ousias,
   H. E. iii. 7. The word principally occurs in Origen among Ante-Nicene
   writers, and he, it must be confessed uses it, as far as the context
   decides its sense, to mean subsistence or person. In other words, it
   was the word of a certain school in the Church, which afterwards was
   accepted by the Church; but this proves nothing about the sense in
   which it was used at NicÃ¦a. The three Hypostases are spoken of by
   Origen, his pupil Dionysius, as afterwards by Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea
   (though he may notwithstanding have considered hypostasis synonymous
   with essence), and Athanasius (Origen in Joan. ii. 6. Dionys. ap. Basil
   de Sp. S. n. 72. Euseb. ap. Socr. i. 23. Athan. in Illud Omnia, &c. 6);
   and the Two Hypostases of the Father and the Son, by Origen, Ammonius,
   and Alexander (Origen c. Cels. viii. 2. Ammon. ap. Caten. in Joan. x.
   30. Alex. ap. Theod. i. 3. p. 740). As to the passage in which two
   hypostases are spoken of in Dionysius' letter to Paul of Samosata, that
   letter certainly is not genuine, as might be shewn on a fitting
   occasion, though it is acknowledged by very great authorities.

   I confess that to my mind there is an antecedent probability that the
   view which has here been followed is correct. Judging by the general
   history of doctrine, one should not expect that the formal
   ecclesiastical meaning of the word should have obtained everywhere so
   early. Nothing is more certain than that the doctrines themselves of
   the Holy Trinity and the Incarnation were developed, or, to speak more
   definitely, that the propositions containing them were acknowledged,
   from the earliest times; but the particular terms which now belong to
   them are most uniformly of a later date. Ideas were brought out, but
   technical phrases did not obtain. Not that these phrases did not exist,
   but either not as technical, or in use in a particular School or
   Church, or with a particular writer, or as hapax legomena, as words
   discussed, nay resisted, perhaps used by some local Council, and then
   at length accepted generally from their obvious propriety. Thus the
   words of the Schools pass into the service of the Catholic Church.
   Instead then of the word hupostasis being, as Maran says, received in
   the East "summo consensu," from the date of Noetus or at least
   Sabellius, or of Bull's opinion "apud Catholicos Dionysii Ã¦tate ratum
   et fixum illud fuisse, tres esse in divinis hypostases," I would
   consider that the present use of the word was in the first instance
   Alexandrian, and that it was little more than Alexandrian till the
   middle of the fourth century.

   Lastly, it comes to be considered how the two words are to be accounted
   for in the Creed, if they have not distinct senses. Coustant supposes
   that ex ousias was added to explain ex hupostaseos, lest the latter
   should be taken in a Sabellian sense. On which we may perhaps remark
   besides, that the reason why hupostasis was selected as the principal
   term was, that it was agreeable to the Westerns as well as admitted by
   the Orientals. Thus, by way of contrast, we find the Second General
   Council, at which there were no Latins, speaking of Three Hypostases,
   and Pope Damasus and the Roman Council speaking a few years sooner of
   the Holy Ghost as of the same hypostasis and usia with the Father and
   the Son. Theod. H. E. ii. 17. Many things go to make this probable. For
   instance, Coustant acutely points out, though Maran and the President
   of Magdalen [Routh, Rel. Sac. iii. 383] dissent, that this probably was
   a point of dispute between the two Dionysii; the Bishop of Alexandria
   asserting, as we know he did assert, Three Hypostases, the Bishop of
   Rome protesting in reply against "Three partitive Hypostases," as
   involving tritheism, and his namesake rejoining, "If because there are
   Three Hypostases, any say that they are partitive, three there are,
   though they like it not." Again, the influence of the West shews itself
   in the language of Athanasius, who, contrary to the custom of his
   Church, of Origen, Dionysius, and his own immediate patron and master
   Alexander, so varies his own use of the word, as to make his writings
   almost an example of that freedom which he vindicated in the Council of
   Alexandria. Again, when Hosius went to Alexandria before the Nicene
   Council, and a dispute arose with reference to Sabellianism about the
   words hupostasis and ousia, what is this too, but the collision of East
   and West? It should be remembered moreover that Hosius presided at
   NicÃ¦a, a Latin in an Eastern city; and again at Sardica, where, though
   the decree in favour of the One Hypostasis was not passed, it seems
   clear from the history that he was resisting persons with whom in great
   measure he agreed. Further, the same consideration accounts for the
   omission of the ex ousias from the Confession of Mark and the two which
   follow, on which Bull relies in proof that the Semi-arians rejected
   this formula. These three Semi-arian Creeds, and these only, were
   addressed to the Latins, and therefore their compilers naturally select
   that synonym which was most pleasing to them, as the means of securing
   a hearing; just as Athanasius on the other hand in his de Decretis,
   writing to the Greeks, omits hupostaseos and writes ousias.

   Introduction to Expositio Fidei.

   ------------------------

   The date of this highly interesting document is quite uncertain, but
   there is every ground for placing it earlier than the explicitly
   anti-Arian treatises. Firstly, the absence of any express reference to
   the controversy against Arians, while yet it is clearly in view in Â§Â§3
   and 4, which lay down the rule afterwards consistently adopted by
   Athanasius with regard to texts which speak of the Saviour as created.
   Secondly, the untroubled use of homoios (Â§1, note 4) to express the
   Son's relation to the Father. Thirdly, the close affinity of this
   Statement to the Sermo Major de Fide which in its turn has very close
   points of contact with the pre-Arian treatises. But see Prolegg. ch.
   iii. Â§1 (37).

   If we are to hazard a conjecture, we may see in this "ekthesis" a
   statement of faith published by Athanasius upon his accession to the
   Episcopate, a.d. 328. The statement proper (Hahn Â§119) consists of Â§1.
   Â§Â§2-4 are an explanatory comment insisting on the distinct Existence of
   the Son, and on His essential uncreatedness.

   The translation which follows has been carefully compared with one made
   by the late Prof. Swainson in his work on the Creeds, pp. 73-76. Dr.
   Swainson there refers to a former imperfect and misleading' translation
   (in Irons' Athanasius contra Mundum) which the present editor has not
   seen. Dr. Swainson expresses doubts as to the Athanasian authorship of
   the Ecthesis, but without any cogent reason. The only point of
   importance is one which acquaintance with the usual language of
   Athanasius shews to make distinctly in favour of, and not against, the
   genuineness of this little tract. Three times in the course of it the
   Human Body, or Humanity of the Lord is spoken of as ho Kuriakos
   anthropus. Dr. Swainson exaggerates the strangeness of the expression
   by the barbarous rendering Lordly man' (How would he translate kuriakon
   deipnon?). But the phrase certainly requires explanation, although the
   explanation is not difficult. (1) It is quoted by Facundus of Hermiane
   from the present work (Def. Tr. Cap. xi. 5), and by Rufinus from an
   unnamed work of Athanasius (libellus'), probably the present one.
   Moreover, Athanasius himself uses the phrase, frequently in the Sermo
   Major de Fide, and in his exposition of Psalm xl. (xli.). Epiphanius
   uses it at least twice (Ancor. 78 and 95); and from these Greek Fathers
   the phrase (Dominicus Homo') passed on to Latin writers such as Cassian
   and Augustine (below, note 5), who, however, subsequently cancelled his
   adoption of the expression (Retr. I. xix. 8). The phrase, therefore, is
   not to be objected to as un-Athanasian. In fact (2) it is founded upon
   the profuse and characteristic use by Ath. of the word anthropos to
   designate the manhood of our Lord (see Orat. c. Ar. i. 41, 45, ii. 45,
   note 2. Dr. Swainson appears unaware of this in his unsatisfactory
   paragraph p. 77, lines 14 and foll.). If the human nature of Christ may
   be called anthropos (1 Tim. ii. 5) at all, there is no difficulty in
   its being called ho anthr. tou soteros (Serm. M. de F. 24 and 30), or
   kuriakos anthropos, a phrase equated with to [kuriakon] soma in Serm.
   M. de F. 19 and 28-31 (see also a discussion in Thilo Athan. Opp. Dogm.
   select. p. 2). This use of the word anthropos, if carelessly employed,
   might lend itself to a Nestorian sense. But Athanasius does not employ
   it carelessly, nor in an ambiguous context; although of course he might
   have used different language had he foreseen the controversies of the
   fifth century. At any rate, enough has been said to shew that its use
   in the present treatise does not expose its genuineness to cavil.

   Statement of Faith.

   ------------------------

   1. We believe in one Unbegotten [428] God, Father Almighty, maker of
   all things both visible and invisible, that hath His being from
   Himself. And in one Only-begotten Word, Wisdom, Son, begotten of the
   Father without beginning and eternally; word not pronounced [429] nor
   mental, nor an effluence [430] of the Perfect, nor a dividing of the
   impassible Essence, nor an issue [431] ; but absolutely perfect Son,
   living and powerful (Heb. iv. 12), the true Image of the Father, equal
   in honour and glory. For this, he says, is the will of the Father, that
   as they honour the Father, so they may honour the Son also' (Joh. v.
   23): very God of very God, as John says in his general Epistles, And we
   are in Him that is true, even in His Son Jesus Christ: this is the true
   God and everlasting life' (1 Joh. v. 20): Almighty of Almighty. For all
   things which the Father rules and sways, the Son rules and sways
   likewise: wholly from the Whole, being like [432] the Father as the
   Lord says, he that hath seen Me hath seen the Father' (Joh. xiv. 9).
   But He was begotten ineffably and incomprehensibly, for who shall
   declare his generation?' (Isa. liii. 8), in other words, no one can.
   Who, when at the consummation of the ages (Heb. ix. 26), He had
   descended from the bosom of the Father, took from the undefiled Virgin
   Mary our humanity (anthropon), Christ Jesus, whom He delivered of His
   own will to suffer for us, as the Lord saith: No man taketh My life
   from Me. I have power to lay it down, and have power to take it again'
   (Joh. x. 18). In which humanity He was crucified and died for us, and
   rose from the dead, and was taken up into the heavens, having been
   created as the beginning of ways for us (Prov. viii. 22), when on earth
   He shewed us light from out of darkness, salvation from error, life
   from the dead, an entrance to paradise, from which Adam was cast out,
   and into which he again entered by means of the thief, as the Lord
   said, This day shalt thou be with Me in paradise' (Luke xxiii. 43),
   into which Paul also once entered. [He shewed us] also a way up to the
   heavens, whither the humanity of the Lord [433] , in which He will
   judge the quick and the dead, entered as precursor for us. We believe,
   likewise, also in the Holy Spirit that searcheth all things, even the
   deep things of God (1 Cor. ii. 10), and we anathematise doctrines
   contrary to this.

   2. For neither do we hold a Son-Father, as do the Sabellians, calling
   Him of one but not of the same [434] essence, and thus destroying the
   existence of the Son. Neither do we ascribe the passible body which He
   bore for the salvation of the whole world to the Father. Neither can we
   imagine three Subsistences separated from each other, as results from
   their bodily nature in the case of men, lest we hold a plurality of
   gods like the heathen. But just as a river, produced from a well, is
   not separate, and yet there are in fact two visible objects and two
   names. For neither is the Father the Son, nor the Son the Father. For
   the Father is Father of the Son, and the Son, Son of the Father. For
   like as the well is not a river, nor the river a well, but both are one
   and the same water which is conveyed in a channel from the well to the
   river, so the Father's deity passes into the Son without flow and
   without division. For the Lord says, I came out from the Father and am
   come' (Joh. xvi. 28). But He is ever with the Father, for He is in the
   bosom of the Father, nor was ever the bosom of the Father void of the
   deity of the Son. For He says, I was by Him as one setting in order'
   (Prov. viii. 30). But we do not regard God the Creator of all, the Son
   of God, as a creature, or thing made, or as made out of nothing, for He
   is truly existent from Him who exists, alone existing from Him who
   alone exists, in as much as the like glory and power was eternally and
   conjointly begotten of the Father. For He that hath seen' the Son hath
   seen the Father (Joh. xiv. 9). All things to wit were made through the
   Son; but He Himself is not a creature, as Paul says of the Lord: In Him
   were all things created, and He is before all' (Col. i. 16). Now He
   says not, was created' before all things, but is' before all things. To
   be created, namely, is applicable to all things, but is before all'
   applies to the Son only.

   3. He is then by nature an Offspring, perfect from the Perfect,
   begotten before all the hills (Prov. viii. 25), that is before every
   rational and intelligent essence, as Paul also in another place calls
   Him first-born of all creation' (Col. i. 15). But by calling Him
   First-born, He shews that He is not a Creature, but Offspring of the
   Father. For it would be inconsistent with His deity for Him to be
   called a creature. For all things were created by the Father through
   the Son, but the Son alone was eternally begotten from the Father,
   whence God the Word is first-born of all creation,' unchangeable from
   unchangeable. However, the body which He wore for our sakes is a
   creature: concerning which Jeremiah says, according to the edition of
   the seventy translators [435] (Jer. xxxi. 22): The Lord created for us
   for a planting a new salvation, in which salvation men shall go about:'
   but according to Aquila the same text runs: The Lord created a new
   thing in woman.' Now the salvation created for us for a planting, which
   is new, not old, and for us, not before us, is Jesus, Who in respect of
   the Saviour [436] was made man, and whose name is translated in one
   place Salvation, in another Saviour. But salvation proceeds from the
   Saviour, just as illumination does from the light. The salvation, then,
   which was from the Saviour, being created new, did, as Jeremiah says,
   create for us a new salvation,' and as Aquila renders: The Lord created
   a new thing in woman,' that is in Mary. For nothing new was created in
   woman, save the Lord's body, born of the Virgin Mary without
   intercourse, as also it says in the Proverbs in the person of Jesus:
   The Lord created me, a beginning of His ways for His works' (Prov.
   viii. 22). Now He does not say, created me before His works,' lest any
   should take the text of the deity of the Word.

   4. Each text then which refers to the creature is written with
   reference to Jesus in a bodily sense. For the Lord's Humanity [437] was
   created as a beginning of ways,' and He manifested it to us for our
   salvation. For by it we have our access to the Father. For He is the
   way (Joh. xiv. 6) which leads us back to the Father. And a way is a
   corporeal visible thing, such as is the Lord's humanity. Well, then,
   the Word of God created all things, not being a creature, but an
   offspring. For He created none of the created things equal or like unto
   Himself. But it is the part of a Father to beget, while it is a
   workman's part to create. Accordingly, that body is a thing made and
   created, which the Lord bore for us, which was begotten for us [438] ,
   as Paul says, wisdom from God, and sanctification and righteousness,
   and redemption;' while yet the Word was before us and before all
   Creation, and is, the Wisdom of the Father. But the Holy Spirit, being
   that which proceeds from the Father, is ever in the hands [439] of the
   Father Who sends and of the Son Who conveys Him, by Whose means He
   filled all things. The Father, possessing His existence from Himself,
   begat the Son, as we said, and did not create Him, as a river from a
   well and as a branch from a root, and as brightness from a light,
   things which nature knows to be indivisible; through whom to the Father
   be glory and power and greatness before all ages, and unto all the ages
   of the ages. Amen.

   Introduction to In Illud Omnia,' Etc.

   ------------------------

   This memorandum or short article was written, as its first sentence
   shews, during the lifetime of Eusebius of Nicomedia, and therefore not
   later than the summer of a.d. 342. The somewhat abrupt beginning, and
   the absence of any exposition of the latter portion of the text, have
   led to the inference that the work is a fragment: but its conclusion is
   evidently perfect, and the opening words probably refer to the text
   itself. The tract is a reply to the Arian argument founded upon Luke x.
   22 (Matt. xi. 27). If all things' had been delivered to the Son by the
   Father, it would follow that once He was without them. Now all things'
   include His Divine Sonship. Therefore there was a time when the Son was
   not. Athanasius meets this argument by totally denying the minor
   premise. By all things,' he argues, Christ referred to His mediatorial
   work and its glories, not to His essential nature as Word of God. He
   then adduces Joh. xvi. 15, to shew at once the Son's distinctness from
   the Father, and that the Father's attributes must also be those of the
   Son.

   The interpretation of the main text given in this tract was not
   subsequently maintained by Athanasius: in Orat. iii. 35, he explains it
   of the Son, as safeguarding His separate personality against the
   Sabellians. It should, however, be noted that this change of ground
   does not involve any concession to the Arian use of the passage: it
   merely transfers the denial of Athanasius from their minor to their
   major premise.

   Beyond the fact that the tract was written before 342 there is no
   conclusive evidence as to its date. But it is generally placed
   (Montfaucon, Ceillier, Alzog) before the Encyclical,' which was written
   in 339, and in several particulars it differs from the later anti-Arian
   treatises: perhaps then we may conjecturally place it about 335, i.e.
   before the first exile of the Pope.'

   On Luke X. 22 (Matt. XI. 27).

   ------------------------

   Â§1. This text refers not to the eternal Word but to the Incarnate.

   "All things were delivered to Me by My Father. And none knoweth Who the
   Son is, save the Father; and Who the Father is, save the Son, and he to
   whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal Him."

   And from not perceiving this they of the sect of Arius, Eusebius and
   his fellows, indulge impiety against the Lord. For they say, if all
   things were delivered (meaning by all' the Lordship of Creation), there
   was once a time when He had them not. But if He had them not, He is not
   of the Father, for if He were, He would on that account have had them
   always, and would not have required to receive them. But this point
   will furnish all the clearer an exposure of their folly. For the
   expression in question does not refer to the Lordship over Creation,
   nor to presiding over the works of God, but is meant to reveal in part
   the intention of the Incarnation (tes oikonomias). For if when He was
   speaking they were delivered' to Him, clearly before He received them,
   creation was void of the Word. What then becomes of the text "in Him
   all things consist" (Col. i. 17)? But if simultaneously with the origin
   of the Creation it was all delivered' to Him, such delivery were
   superfluous, for all things were made by Him' (Joh. i. 3), and it would
   be unnecessary for those things of which the Lord Himself was the
   artificer to be delivered over to Him. For in making them He was Lord
   of the things which were being originated. But even supposing they were
   delivered' to Him after they were originated, see the monstrosity. For
   if they were delivered,' and upon His receiving them the Father
   retired, then we are in peril of falling into the fabulous tales which
   some tell, that He gave over [His works] to the Son, and Himself
   departed. Or if, while the Son has them, the Father has them also, we
   ought to say, not were delivered,' but that He took Him as partner, as
   Paul did Silvanus. But this is even more monstrous; for God is not
   imperfect [440] , nor did He summon the Son to help Him in His need;
   but, being Father of the Word, He makes all things by His means, and
   without delivering creation over to Him, by His means and in Him
   exercises Providence over it, so that not even a sparrow falls to the
   ground without the Father (Matt. x. 29), nor is the grass clothed
   without God (ib. vi. 30), but at once the Father worketh, and the Son
   worketh hitherto (cf. Joh. v. 17). Vain, therefore, is the opinion of
   the impious. For the expression is not what they think, but designates
   the Incarnation.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§2. Sense in which, and end for which all things were delivered to the
   Incarnate Son.

   For whereas man sinned, and is fallen, and by his fall all things are
   in confusion: death prevailed from Adam to Moses (cf. Rom. v. 14), the
   earth was cursed, Hades was opened, Paradise shut, Heaven offended,
   man, lastly, corrupted and brutalised (cf. Ps. xlix. 12), while the
   devil was exulting against us;--then God, in His loving-kindness, not
   willing man made in His own image to perish, said, Whom shall I send,
   and who will go?' (Isa. vi. 8). But while all held their peace, the Son
   [441] said, Here am I, send Me.' And then it was that, saying Go Thou,'
   He delivered' to Him man, that the Word Himself might be made Flesh,
   and by taking the Flesh, restore it wholly. For to Him, as to a
   physician, man was delivered' to heal the bite of the serpent; as to
   life, to raise what was dead; as to light, to illumine the darkness;
   and, because He was Word, to renew the rational nature (to logikon).
   Since then all things were delivered' to Him, and He is made Man,
   straightway all things were set right and perfected. Earth receives
   blessing instead of a curse, Paradise was opened to the robber, Hades
   cowered, the tombs were opened and the dead raised, the gates of Heaven
   were lifted up to await Him that cometh from Edom' (Ps. xxiv. 7, Isa.
   lxiii. 1). Why, the Saviour Himself expressly signifies in what sense
   all things were delivered' to Him, when He continues, as Matthew tells
   us: Come unto Me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will
   give you rest' (Matt. xi. 28). Yes, ye were delivered' to Me to give
   rest to those who had laboured, and life to the dead. And what is
   written in John's Gospel harmonises with this: The Father loveth the
   Son, and hath given all things into His hand' (Joh. iii. 35). Given, in
   order that, just as all things were made by Him, so in Him all things
   might be renewed. For they were not delivered' unto Him, that being
   poor, He might be made rich, nor did He receive all things that He
   might receive power which before He lacked: far be the thought: but in
   order that as Saviour He might rather set all things right. For it was
   fitting that while through Him' all things came into being at the
   beginning, in Him' (note the change of phrase) all things should be set
   right (cf. Joh. i. 3, Eph. i. 10). For at the beginning they came into
   being through' Him; but afterwards, all having fallen, the Word has
   been made Flesh, and put it on, in order that in Him' all should be set
   right. Suffering Himself, He gave us rest, hungering Himself, He
   nourished us, and going down into Hades He brought us back thence. For
   example, at the time of the creation of all things, their creation
   consisted in a fiat, such as let [the earth] bring forth,' let there
   be' (Gen. i. 3, 11), but at the restoration it was fitting that all
   things should be delivered' to Him, in order that He might be made man,
   and all things be renewed in Him. For man, being in Him, was quickened:
   for this was why the Word was united to man, namely, that against man
   the curse might no longer prevail. This is the reason why they record
   the request made on behalf of mankind in the seventy-first Psalm: Give
   the King Thy judgment, O God' (Ps. lxxii. 1): asking that both the
   judgment of death which hung over us may be delivered to the Son, and
   that He may then, by dying for us, abolish it for us in Himself. This
   was what He signified, saying Himself, in the eighty-seventh Psalm:
   Thine indignation lieth hard upon me' (Ps. lxxxviii. 7). For He bore
   the indignation which lay upon us, as also He says in the hundred and
   thirty-seventh: Lord, Thou shalt do vengeance for me' (Ps. cxxxviii. 8,
   LXX.).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [441] This dramatic representation of the Mission of the Son stands
   alone in the writings of Athanasius, and, if pressed, lends itself to a
   conception of the relation of the Son to the Father which, if not
   Arian, is at least contrary to the more explicit and mature conception
   of Athanasius as formulated for example in Orat. ii. 31 (and see note 7
   there). The same idea appears in Milton's Paradise Lost (e.g. Book X.).
   See Newman, Arians 4, p. 93, note.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§3. By all things' is meant the redemptive attributes and power of
   Christ.

   Thus, then, we may understand all things to have been delivered to the
   Saviour, and, if it be necessary to follow up understanding by
   explanation, that hath been delivered unto Him which He did not
   previously possess. For He was not man previously, but became man for
   the sake of saving man. And the Word was not in the beginning flesh,
   but has been made flesh subsequently (cf. Joh. i. 1 sqq.), in which
   Flesh, as the Apostle says, He reconciled the enmity which was against
   us (Col. i. 20, ii. 14, Eph. ii. 15, 16) and destroyed the law of the
   commandments in ordinances, that He might make the two into one new
   man, making peace, and reconcile both in one body to the Father. That,
   however, which the Father has, belongs also to the Son, as also He says
   in John, All things whatsoever the Father hath are Mine' (Joh. xvi.
   15), expressions which could not be improved. For when He became that
   which He was not, all things were delivered' to Him. But when He
   desires to declare His unity with the Father, He teaches it without any
   reserve, saying: All things whatsoever the Father hath are Mine.' And
   one cannot but admire the exactness of the language. For He has not
   said all things whatsoever the Father hath, He hath given to Me,' lest
   He should appear at one time not to have possessed these things; but
   are Mine.' For these things, being in the Father's power, are equally
   in that of the Son. But we must in turn examine what things the Father
   hath.' For if Creation is meant, the Father had nothing before
   creation, and proves to have received something additional from
   Creation; but far be it to think this. For just as He exists before
   creation, so before creation also He has what He has, which we also
   believe to belong to the Son (Joh. xvi. 15). For if the Son is in the
   Father, then all things that the Father has belong to the Son. So this
   expression is subversive of the perversity of the heterodox in saying
   that if all things have been delivered to the Son, then the Father has
   ceased to have power over what is delivered, having appointed the Son
   in His place. For, in fact, the Father judgeth none, but hath given all
   judgment to the Son' (Joh. v. 22). But let the mouth of them that speak
   wickedness be stopped' (Ps. lxiii. 11), (for although He has given all
   judgment to the Son, He is not, therefore, stripped of lordship: nor,
   because it is said that all things are delivered by the Father to the
   Son, is He any the less over all), separating as they clearly do the
   Only-begotten from God, Who is by nature inseparable from Him, even
   though in their madness they separate Him by their words, not
   perceiving, the impious men, that the Light can never be separated from
   the sun, in which it resides by nature. For one must use a poor simile
   drawn from tangible and familiar objects to put our idea into words,
   since it is over bold to intrude upon the incomprehensible nature [of
   God].
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§4. The text John xvi. 15, shews clearly the essential relation of the
   Son to the Father.

   As then the light from the Sun which illumines the world could never be
   supposed, by men of sound mind, to do so without the Sun, since the
   Sun's light is united to the Sun by nature; and as, if the Light [442]
   were to say: I have received from the Sun the power of illumining all
   things, and of giving growth and strength to them by the heat that is
   in me, no one will be mad enough to think that the mention of the Sun
   is meant to separate him from what is his nature, namely the light; so
   piety would have us perceive that the Divine Essence of the Word is
   united by nature to His own Father. For the text before us will put our
   problem in the clearest possible light, seeing that the Saviour said,
   All things whatsoever the Father hath are Mine;' which shews that He is
   ever with the Father. For whatsoever He hath' shews that the Father
   wields the Lordship, while are Mine' shews the inseparable union. It is
   necessary, then, that we should perceive that in the Father reside
   Everlastingness, Eternity, Immortality. Now these reside in Him not as
   adventitious attributes, but, as it were, in a well-spring they reside
   in Him, and in the Son. When then you wish to perceive what relates to
   the Son, learn what is in the Father, for this is what you must believe
   to be in the Son. If then the Father is a thing created or made, these
   qualities belong also to the Son. And if it is permissible to say of
   the Father there was once a time when He was not,' or made of nothing,'
   let these words be applied also to the Son. But if it is impious to
   ascribe these attributes to the Father, grant that it is impious also
   to ascribe them to the Son. For what belongs to the Father, belongs to
   the Son. For he that honoureth the Son, honoureth the Father that sent
   Him, and he that receiveth the Son, receiveth the Father with Him,
   because he that hath seen the Son hath seen the Father (Matt. x. 40;
   John xiv. 9). As then the Father is not a creature, so neither is the
   Son; and as it is not possible to say of Him there was a time when He
   was not,' nor made of nothing,' so it is not proper to say the like of
   the Son either. But rather, as the Father's attributes are
   Everlastingness, Immortality, Eternity, and the being no creature, it
   follows that thus also we must think of the Son. For as it is written
   (Joh. v. 26), As the Father hath life in Himself, so gave He to the Son
   also to have life in Himself.' But He uses the word gave' in order to
   point to the Father who gives. As, again, life is in the Father, so
   also is it in the Son, so as to shew Him to be inseparable and
   everlasting. For this is why He speaks with exactness, whatsoever the
   Father hath,' in order namely that by thus mentioning the Father He may
   avoid being thought to be the Father Himself. For He does not say I am
   the Father,' but whatsoever the Father hath.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   [442] Cf. Orat. iii. 36.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§5. The same text further explained.

   For His Only-begotten Son might, ye Arians, be called Father' by His
   Father, yet not in the sense in which you in your error might perhaps
   understand it, but (while Son of the Father that begat Him) Father of
   the coming age' (Isa. ix. 6, LXX). For it is necessary not to leave any
   of your surmises open to you. Well then, He says by the prophet, A Son
   is born and given to us, whose government is upon his shoulder, and his
   name shall be called Angel of Great Counsel, mighty God, Ruler, Father
   of the coming age' (Isa. ix. 6). The Only-begotten Son of God, then, is
   at once Father of the coming age, and mighty God, and Ruler. And it is
   shewn clearly that all things whatsoever the Father hath are His, and
   that as the Father gives life, the Son likewise is able to quicken whom
   He will. For the dead,' He says, shall hear the voice of the Son, and
   shall live' (cf. John v. 25), and the will and desire of Father and Son
   is one, since their nature also is one and indivisible. And the Arians
   torture themselves to no purpose, from not understanding the saying of
   our Saviour, All things whatsoever the Father hath are Mine.' For from
   this passage at once the delusion of Sabellius can be upset, and it
   will expose the folly of our modern Jews. For this is why the Only
   begotten, having life in Himself as the Father has, also knows alone
   Who the Father is, namely, because He is in the Father and the Father
   in Him. For He is His Image, and consequently, because He is His Image,
   all that belongs to the Father is in Him. He is an exact seal, shewing
   in Himself the Father; living Word and true, Power, Wisdom, our
   Sanctification and Redemption (1 Cor. i. 30). For in Him we both live
   and move and have our being' (Acts xvii. 28), and no man knoweth Who is
   the Father, save the Son, and Who is the Son, save the Father' (Luke x.
   22).
     __________________________________________________________________

   Â§6. The Trisagion wrongly explained by Arians. Its true significance.

   And how do the impious men venture to speak folly, as they ought not,
   being men and unable to find out how to describe even what is on the
   earth? But why do I say what is on the earth?' Let them tell us their
   own nature, if they can discover how to investigate their own nature?
   Rash they are indeed, and self-willed, not trembling to form opinions
   of things which angels desire to look into (1 Pet. i. 12), who are so
   far above them, both in nature and in rank. For what is nearer [God]
   than the Cherubim or the Seraphim? And yet they, not even seeing Him,
   nor standing on their feet, nor even with bare, but as it were with
   veiled faces, offer their praises, with untiring lips doing nought else
   but glorify the divine and ineffable nature with the Trisagion. And
   nowhere has any one of the divinely speaking prophets, men specially
   selected for such vision, reported to us that in the first utterance of
   the word Holy the voice is raised aloud, while in the second it is
   lower, but in the third, quite low,--and that consequently the first
   utterance denotes lordship, the second subordination, and the third
   marks a yet lower degree. But away with the folly of these haters of
   God and senseless men. For the Triad, praised, reverenced, and adored,
   is one and indivisible and without degrees (aschematistos). It is
   united without confusion, just as the Monad also is distinguished
   without separation. For the fact of those venerable living creatures
   (Isa. vi.; Rev. iv. 8) offering their praises three times, saying Holy,
   Holy, Holy,' proves that the Three Subsistences [443] are perfect, just
   as in saying Lord,' they declare the One Essence. They then that
   depreciate the Only-begotten Son of God blaspheme God, defaming His
   perfection and accusing Him of imperfection, and render themselves
   liable to the severest chastisement. For he that blasphemes any one of
   the Subsistences shall have remission neither in this world nor in that
   which is to come. But God is able to open the eyes of their heart to
   contemplate the Sun of Righteousness, in order that coming to know Him
   whom they formerly set at nought, they may with unswerving piety of
   mind together with us glorify Him, because to Him belongs the kingdom,
   even to the Father Son and Holy Spirit, now and for ever. Amen.

   [443] treis hupostaseis. This expression is a link between this tract
   and the Expositio (Â§2), and is one of the indications it bears of an
   early date. At this time we see that Athanasius speaks of Three
   Hypostases,' but qualifies his language by the caveat (Expos. 2) that
   they are not memerismenai. In this he follows his Origenist predecessor
   Dionysius, and the language of the present passage is that of Basil or
   the Gregories. But it is not the language of Athan. himself in his
   later years. See above, Prolegg. ch. ii. Â§3 (2) b, and Introd. to Tom.

   Introduction to the Encyclical Epistle to the Bishops Throughout the
   World.

   ------------------------

   Athanasius wrote the following Epistle in the year 339. In the winter
   at the beginning of that year the Eusebians held a Council at Antioch.
   Here they appointed Gregory to the see of Alexandria in the place of
   Athanasius (see Prolegg. ch. ii. 6). Gregory was by birth a
   Cappadocian, and (if Nazianzen speaks of the same Gregory, which some
   critics doubt) studied at Alexandria, where S. Athanasius had treated
   him with great kindness and familiarity, though Gregory afterwards took
   part in propagating the calumny against him of having murdered
   Arsenius. Gregory was on his appointment dispatched to Alexandria'
   (Newman). The proceedings on his arrival, Lent, 339, are related in the
   following Encyclical Epistle, which Athanasius forwarded immediately
   before his departure for Rome to all the Bishops of the Catholic
   Church. It is less correct in style, as Tillemont observes, than other
   of his works, as if composed in haste. In the Editions previous to the
   Benedictine, it was called an "Epistle to the Orthodox everywhere;" but
   Montfaucon has been able to restore the true title. He has been also
   able from his mss. to make a far more important correction, which has
   cleared up some very perplexing difficulties in the history. All the
   Editions previous to the Benedictine read "George" throughout for
   "Gregory," and "Gregory" in the place where "Pistus" occurs. Baronius,
   Tillemont, &c., had already made the alterations from the necessity of
   the case' (Newman). After comparing the violence done to the Church
   with the outrage upon the Levite's wife in Judges, ch. xix., he appeals
   to the bishops of the universal Church to regard his cause as their own
   (Â§1). He then recounts the details of what has happened; the
   announcement by the Prefect Philagrius of the supersession of Ath. by
   Gregory, the popular indignation, and its grounds (Â§2); the instigation
   of the heathen mob by Philagrius to commit outrages upon the sacred
   persons and buildings (Â§3); the violent intrusion of Gregory (Â§4); the
   proceedings against himself (Â§5). He warns them against Gregory as an
   Arian, and asks their sympathy for himself (Â§6), and that they will
   refuse to receive any of Gregory's letters (Â§7). The Encyclical' was
   written just before his departure from Alexandria, where he must have
   been in retirement for three weeks (Index to Festal Letter, 339)
   previously, as he appears (Â§5) to have remained in the town till after
   Easter-day. Dr. Bright (p. xv. note) sees here a proof of the
   inaccuracy of the Index:' but there are other grounds for regarding it
   as correct (see Prolegg. ch. v. Â§3, c, and Introd. to Letters): its
   chronology is therefore adopted by the present editor. The events which
   led up to the scenes described in the letter are more fully dealt with
   in Prolegg. ch. ii. Â§6 (I), sub fin. and (2). It may be added that
   Sozomen, iii. 6 in describing this escape of Athan., inserts the scene
   in the Church which really took place in Feb. 356, while Socrates ii.
   11 confuses the two occasions even more completely. Internal evidence
   shews that Soz. partially corrected Socr. by the aid of the Hist.
   Aceph. The confusion of Gregory with George (especially easy in Latin),
   to which almost every historian from Socrates and Theodoret to Neander
   and Newman has fallen an occasional victim, appears to have vitiated
   the transcription of this encyclical from very early times. But Sievers
   (p. 104) goes too far in ascribing to that cause the insertion of a
   great part of Â§Â§3-5.

   Our sufferings have been dreadful beyond endurance, and it is
   impossible to describe them in suitable terms; but in order that the
   dreadful nature of the events which have taken place may be more
   readily apprehended, I have thought it good to remind you of a history
   out of the Scriptures. It happened that a certain Levite [444] was
   injured in the person of his wife; and, when he considered the
   exceeding greatness of the pollution (for the woman was a Hebrew, and
   of the tribe of Judah), being astounded at the outrage which had been
   committed against him, he divided his wife's body, as the Holy
   Scripture relates in the Book of Judges, and sent a part of it to every
   tribe in Israel, in order that it might be understood that an injury
   like this pertained not to himself only, but extended to all alike; and
   that, if the people sympathised with him in his sufferings, they might
   avenge him; or if they neglected to do so, might bear the disgrace of
   being considered thenceforth as themselves guilty of the wrong. The
   messengers whom he sent related what had happened; and they that heard
   and saw it, declared that such things had never been done from the day
   that the children of Israel came up out of Egypt. So every tribe of
   Israel was moved, and all came together against the offenders, as
   though they had themselves been the sufferers; and at last the
   perpetrators of this iniquity were destroyed in war, and became a curse
   in the mouths of all: for the assembled people considered not their
   kindred blood, but regarded only the crime they had committed. You know
   the history, brethren, and the particular account of the circumstances
   given in Scripture. I will not therefore describe them more in detail,
   since I write to persons acquainted with them, and as I am anxious to
   represent to your piety our present circumstances, which are even worse
   than those to which I have referred. For my object in reminding you of
   this history is this, that you may compare those ancient transactions
   with what has happened to us now, and perceiving how much these last
   exceed the other in cruelty, may be filled with greater indignation on
   account of them, than were the people of old against those offenders.
   For the treatment we have undergone surpasses the bitterness of any
   persecution; and the calamity of the Levite was but small, when
   compared with the enormities which have now been committed against the
   Church; or rather such deeds as these were never before heard of in the
   whole world, or the like experienced by any one. For in that case it
   was but a single woman that was injured, and one Levite who suffered
   wrong; now the whole Church is injured, the priesthood insulted, and
   worst of all, piety [445] is persecuted by impiety. On that occasion
   the tribes were astounded, each at the sight of part of the body of one
   woman; but now the members of the whole Church are seen divided from
   one another, and are sent abroad some to you, and some to others,
   bringing word of the insults and injustice which they have suffered. Be
   ye therefore also moved, I beseech you, considering that these wrongs
   are done unto you no less than unto us; and let every one lend his aid,
   as feeling that he is himself a sufferer, lest shortly ecclesiastical
   Canons, and the faith of the Church be corrupted. For both are in
   danger, unless God shall speedily by your hands amend what has been
   done amiss, and the Church be avenged on her enemies. For our Canons
   [446] and our forms were not given to the Churches at the present day,
   but were wisely and safely transmitted to us from our forefathers.
   Neither had our faith its beginning at this time, but it came down to
   us from the Lord through His disciples [447] . That therefore the
   ordinances which have been preserved in the Churches from old time
   until now, may not be lost in our days, and the trust which has been
   committed to us required at our hands; rouse yourselves, brethren, as
   being stewards of the mysteries of God [448] , and seeing them now
   seized upon by others. Further particulars of our condition you will
   learn from the bearers of our letters; but I was anxious myself to
   write you a brief account thereof, that you may know for certain, that
   such things have never before been committed against the Church, from
   the day that our Saviour when He was taken up, gave command to His
   disciples, saying, Go ye and make disciples of all nations, baptizing
   them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost
   [449] .'

   Â§2. Violent and Uncanonical Intrusion of Gregory.

   Now the outrages which have been committed against us and against the
   Church are these. While we were holding our assemblies in peace, as
   usual, and while the people were rejoicing in them, and advancing in
   godly conversation, and while our fellow-ministers in Egypt, and the
   Thebais, and Libya, were in love and peace both with one another and
   with us; on a sudden the Prefect of Egypt puts forth a public letter,
   bearing the form of an edict, and declaring that one Gregory from
   Cappadocia was coming to be my successor from the court. This
   announcement confounded every one, for such a proceeding was entirely
   novel, and now heard of for the first time. The people however
   assembled still more constantly in the churches [450] , for they very
   well knew that neither they themselves, nor any Bishop or Presbyter,
   nor in short any one had ever complained against me; and they saw that
   Arians only were on his side, and were aware also that he was himself
   an Arian, and was sent by Eusebius and his fellows to the Arian party.
   For you know, brethren, that Eusebius and his fellows have always been
   the supporters and associates of the impious heresy of the Arian madmen
   [451] , by whose means they have ever carried on their designs against
   me, and were the authors of my banishment into Gaul.

   The people, therefore, were justly indignant and exclaimed against the
   proceeding, calling the rest of the magistrates and the whole city to
   witness, that this novel and iniquitous attempt was now made against
   the Church, not on the ground of any charge brought against me by
   ecclesiastical persons, but through the wanton assault of the Arian
   heretics. For even if there had been any complaint generally prevailing
   against me, it was not an Arian, or one professing Arian doctrines,
   that ought to have been chosen to supersede me; but according to the
   ecclesiastical Canons, and the direction of Paul, when the people were
   gathered together, and the spirit' of them that ordain, with the power
   of our Lord Jesus Christ [452] ' all things ought to have been enquired
   into and transacted canonically, in the presence of those among the
   laity and clergy who demanded the change; and not that a person brought
   from a distance by Arians, as if making a traffic of the title of
   Bishop, should with the patronage and strong arm of heathen
   magistrates, thrust himself upon those who neither asked for nor
   desired his presence, nor indeed knew anything of what had been done.
   Such proceedings tend to the dissolution of all the ecclesiastical
   Canons, and compel the heathen to blaspheme, and to suspect that our
   appointments are not made according to a divine rule, but as a result
   of traffic and patronage [453] .

   [450] Assembling in the Churches seems to have been a sort of protest
   or demonstration, sometimes peaceably, but sometimes in a more
   exceptionable manner;--peaceably, during Justina's persecution at
   Milan, Ambros. Ep. i. 20. August. Confess. ix. 15, but at Ephesus after
   the third Ecumenical Council the Metropolitan shut up the Churches,
   took possession of the Cathedral, and succeeded in repelling the
   imperial troops. Churches were asylums, vid. Cod. Theodos. ix. 45. Â§4.
   &c.; at the same time arms were prohibited.

   Â§3. Outrages which took place at the time of Gregory's arrival.

   Thus was this notable appointment of Gregory brought about by the
   Arians, and such was the beginning of it. And what outrages he
   committed on his entry into Alexandria, and of what great evils that
   event has been the cause, you may learn both from our letters, and by
   enquiry of those who are sojourning among you. While the people were
   offended at such an unusual proceeding, and in consequence assembled in
   the churches, in order to prevent the impiety of the Arians from
   mingling itself with the faith of the Church, Philagrius, who has long
   been a persecutor of the Church and her virgins, and is now Prefect
   [454] of Egypt, an apostate already, and a fellow-countryman of
   Gregory, a man too of no respectable character, and moreover supported
   by Eusebius and his fellows, and therefore full of zeal against the
   Church; this person, by means of promises which he afterwards
   fulfilled, succeeded in gaining over the heathen multitude, with the
   Jews and disorderly persons, and having excited their passions, sent
   them in a body with swords and clubs into the churches to attack the
   people.

   What followed upon this [455] it is by no means easy to describe:
   indeed it is not possible to set before you a just representation of
   the circumstances, nor even could one recount a small part of them
   without tears and lamentations. Have such deeds as these ever been made
   the subjects of tragedy among the ancients? or has the like ever
   happened before in time of persecution or of war? The church and the
   holy Baptistery were set on fire, and straightway groans, shrieks, and
   lamentations, were heard through the city; while the citizens in their
   indignation at these enormities, cried shame upon the governor, and
   protested against the violence used to them. For holy and undefiled
   virgins [456] were being stripped naked, and suffering treatment which
   is not to be named and if they resisted, they were in danger of their
   lives. Monks were being trampled under foot and perishing; some were
   being hurled headlong; others were being destroyed with swords and
   clubs; others were being wounded and beaten. And oh! what deeds of
   impiety and iniquity have been committed upon the Holy Table! They were
   offering birds and pine cones [457] in sacrifice, singing the praises
   of their idols, and blaspheming even in the very churches our Lord and
   Saviour Jesus-Christ, the Son of the living God. They were burning the
   books of Holy Scripture which they found in the church; and the Jews,
   the murderers of our Lord, and the godless heathen entering
   irreverently (O strange boldness!) the holy Baptistery, were stripping
   themselves naked, and acting such a disgraceful part, both by word and
   deed, as one is ashamed even to relate. Certain impious men also,
   following the examples set them in the bitterest persecutions, were
   seizing upon the virgins and ascetics by the hands and dragging them
   along, and as they were haling them, endeavoured to make them blaspheme
   and deny the Lord; and when they refused to do so, were beating them
   violently and trampling them under foot.

   having been first appointed by Augustus, after his victories over

   Â§4. Outrages on Good Friday and Easter Day, 339.

   In addition to all this, after such a notable and illustrious entry
   into the city, the Arian Gregory, taking pleasure in these calamities,
   and as if desirous to secure to the heathens and Jews, and those who
   had wrought these evils upon us, a prize and price of their iniquitous
   success, gave up the church to be plundered by them. Upon this license
   of iniquity and disorder, their deeds were worse than in time of war,
   and more cruel than those of robbers. Some of them were plundering
   whatever fell in their way; others dividing among themselves the sums
   which some had laid up there [458] ; the wine, of which there was a
   large quantity, they either drank or emptied out or carried away; they
   plundered the store of oil, and every one took as his spoil the doors
   and chancel rails; the candlesticks they forthwith laid aside in the
   wall [459] , and lighted the candles of the Church before their idols:
   in a word, rapine and death pervaded the Church. And the impious
   Arians, so far from feeling shame that such things should be done,
   added yet further outrages and cruelty. Presbyters and laymen had their
   flesh torn, virgins were stript of their veils [460] , and led away to
   the tribunal of the governor, and then cast into prison; others had
   their goods confiscated, and were scourged; the bread of the ministers
   and virgins was intercepted. And these things were done even during the
   holy season of Lent [461] , about the time of Easter; a time when the
   brethren were keeping fast, while this notable Gregory exhibited the
   disposition of a Caiaphas, and, together with Pilate the Governor,
   furiously raged against the pious worshippers of Christ. Going into one
   of the churches on the Preparation [462] , in company with the Governor
   and the heathen multitude, when he saw that the people regarded with
   abhorrence his forcible entry among them, he caused that most cruel
   person, the Governor, publicly to scourge in one hour, four and thirty
   virgins and married women, and men of rank, and to cast them into
   prison. Among them there was one virgin, who, being fond of study, had
   the Psalter in her hands, at the time when he caused her to be publicly
   scourged: the book was torn in pieces by the officers, and the virgin
   herself shut up in prison.

   Â§5. Retirement of Athanasius, and tyranny of Gregory and Philagrius.

   When all this was done, they did not stop even here; but consulted how
   they might act the same part in the other church [463] , where I was
   mostly living during those days; and they were eager to extend their
   fury to this church also, in order that they might hunt out and
   dispatch me. And this would have been my fate, had not the grace of
   Christ assisted me, if it were only that I might escape to relate these
   few particulars concerning their conduct. For seeing that they were
   exceedingly mad against me, and being anxious that the church should
   not be injured, nor the virgins that were in it suffer, nor additional
   murders be committed, nor the people again outraged, I withdrew myself
   from among them, remembering the words of our Saviour, If they
   persecute you in this city, flee ye into another [464] .' For I knew,
   from the evil they had done against the first-named church, that they
   would forbear no outrage against the other also. And there in fact they
   reverenced not even the Lord's day [465] of the holy Feast, but in that
   church also they imprisoned the persons who belonged to it, at a time
   when the Lord delivered all from the bonds of death, whereas Gregory
   and his associates, as if fighting against our Saviour, and depending
   upon the patronage of the Governor, have turned into mourning this day
   of liberty to the servants of Christ. The heathens were rejoicing to do
   this, for they abhor that day; and Gregory perhaps did but fulfil the
   commands of Eusebius and his fellows in forcing the Christians to mourn
   under the infliction of bonds.

   With these acts of violence has the Governor seized upon the churches,
   and has given them up to Gregory and the Arian madmen. Thus, those
   persons who were excommunicated by us for their impiety, now glory in
   the plunder of our churches; while the people of God, and the Clergy of
   the Catholic Church are compelled either to have communion with the
   impiety of the Arian heretics, or else to forbear entering into them.
   Moreover, by means of the Governor, Gregory has exercised no small
   violence towards the captains of ships and others who pass over sea,
   torturing and scourging some, putting others in bonds, and casting them
   into prison, in order to oblige them not to resist his iniquities, and
   to take letters [466] from him. And not satisfied with all this, that
   he may glut himself with our blood, he has caused his savage associate,
   the Governor, to prefer an indictment against me, as in the name of the
   people, before the most religious Emperor Constantius, which contains
   odious charges, from which one may expect not only to be banished, but
   even ten thousand deaths. The person who drew it up is an apostate from
   Christianity, and a shameless worshipper of idols, and they who
   subscribed it are heathens, and keepers of idol temples, and others of
   them Arians. In short, not to make my letter tedious to you, a
   persecution rages here, and such a persecution as was never before
   raised against the Church. For in former instances a man at least might
   pray while he fled from his persecutors, and be baptized while he lay
   in concealment. But now their extreme cruelty has imitated the godless
   conduct of the Babylonians. For as they falsely accused Daniel [467] ,
   so does the notable Gregory now accuse before the Governor those who
   pray in their houses, and watches every opportunity to insult their
   ministers, so that through his violent conduct, many are endangered
   from missing baptism, and many who are in sickness and sorrow have no
   one to visit them, a calamity which they bitterly lament, accounting it
   worse than their sickness. For while the ministers of the Church are
   under persecution, the people who condemn the impiety of the Arian
   heretics choose rather thus to be sick and to run the risk, than that a
   hand of the Arians should come upon their heads.

   Â§6. All the above illegalities were carried on in the interest of
   Arianism.

   Gregory then is an Arian, and has been sent to the Arian party; for
   none demanded him, but they only; and accordingly as a hireling and a
   stranger, he makes use of the Governor to inflict these dreadful and
   cruel deeds upon the people of the Catholic Churches, as not being his
   own. For since Pistus, whom Eusebius and his fellows formerly appointed
   over the Arians, was justly anathematized [468] and excommunicated for
   his impiety by you the Bishops of the Catholic Church, as you all know,
   on our writing to you concerning him, they have now, therefore, in like
   manner sent this Gregory to them; and lest they should a second time be
   put to shame, by our again writing against them, they have employed
   extraneous force against me, in order that, having obtained possession
   of the Churches, they may seem to have escaped all suspicion of being
   Arians. But in this too they have been mistaken, for none of the people
   of the Church are with them, except the heretics only, and those who
   have been excommunicated on divers charges, and such as have been
   compelled by the Governor to dissemble. This then is the drama of
   Eusebius and his fellows, which they have long been rehearsing and
   composing; and now have succeeded in performing through the false
   charges which they have made against me before the Emperor [469] .
   Notwithstanding, they are not yet content to be quiet, but even now
   seek to kill me; and they make themselves so formidable to our friends,
   that they are all driven into banishment, and expect death at their
   hands. But you must not for this stand in awe of their iniquity, but on
   the contrary avenge: and shew your indignation at this their
   unprecedented conduct against us. For if when one member suffers all
   the members suffer with it, and, according to the blessed Apostle, we
   ought to weep with them that weep [470] , let every one, now that so
   great a Church as this is suffering, avenge its wrongs, as though he
   were himself a sufferer. For we have a common Saviour, who is
   blasphemed by them, and Canons belonging to us all, which they are
   transgressing. If while any of you had been sitting in your Church, and
   while the people were assembled with you, without any blame, some one
   had suddenly come under plea of an edict as successor of one of you,
   and had acted the same part towards you, would you not have been
   indignant? would you not have demanded to be righted? If so, then it is
   right that you should be indignant now, lest if these things be passed
   over unnoticed, the same mischief shall by degrees extend itself to
   every Church, and so our schools of religion be turned into a
   market-house and an exchange.

   Â§7. Appeal to the bishops of the whole Church to unite against Gregory.

   You are acquainted with the history of the Arian madmen, beloved, for
   you have often, both individually and in a body, condemned their
   impiety; and you know also that Eusebius and his fellows, as I said
   before, are engaged in the same heresy; for the sake of which they have
   long been carrying on a conspiracy against me. And I have represented
   to you, what has now been done, both for them and by them, with greater
   cruelty than is usual even in time of war, in order that after the
   example set before you in the history which I related at the beginning,
   you may entertain a zealous hatred of their wickedness, and reject
   those who have committed such enormities against the Church. If the
   brethren at Rome [471] [last year], before these things had happened,
   and on account of their former misdeeds, wrote letters to call a
   Council, that these evils might be set right (fearing which, Eusebius
   and his fellows took care previously to throw the Church into
   confusion, and desired to destroy me, in order that they might
   thenceforth be able to act as they pleased without fear, and might have
   no one to call them to account), how much more ought you now to be
   indignant at these outrages, and to condemn them, seeing they have
   added this to their former misconduct.

   I beseech you, overlook not such proceedings, nor suffer the famous
   Church of the Alexandrians to be trodden down by heretics. In
   consequence of these things the people and their ministers are
   separated from one another, as one might expect, silenced by the
   violence of the Prefect, yet abhorring the impiety of the Arian madmen.
   If therefore Gregory shall write unto you, or any other in his behalf,
   receive not his letters, brethren, but tear them in pieces and put the
   bearers of them to shame, as the ministers of impiety and wickedness.
   And even if he presume to write to you after a friendly fashion,
   nevertheless receive them not. Those who bring his letters convey them
   only from fear of the Governor, and on account of his frequent acts of
   violence. And since it is probable that Eusebius and his fellows will
   write to you concerning him, I was anxious to admonish you beforehand,
   so that you may herein imitate God, Who is no respecter of persons, and
   may drive out from before you those that come from them; because for
   the sake of the Arian madmen they caused persecutions, rape of virgins,
   murders, plunder of the Church's property, burnings, and blasphemies in
   the Churches, to be committed by the heathens and Jews at such a
   season. The impious and mad Gregory cannot deny that he is an Arian,
   being proved to be so by the person who writes his letters. This is his
   secretary Ammon, who was cast out of the Church long ago by my
   predecessor the blessed Alexander for many misdeeds and for impiety.

   For all these reasons, therefore, vouchsafe to send me a reply, and
   condemn these impious men; so that even now the ministers and people of
   this place, seeing your orthodoxy and hatred of wickedness, may rejoice
   in your concord in the Christian faith, and that those who have been
   guilty of these lawless deeds against the Church may be reformed by
   your letters, and brought at last, though late, to repentance. Salute
   the brotherhood that is among you. All the brethren that are with me
   salute you. Fare ye well, and remember me, and the Lord preserve you
   continually, most truly beloved lords.

   Introduction to Apologia Contra Arianos.

   ------------------------

   "This Apology," says Montfaucon, "is the most authentic source of the
   history of the Church in the first half of the fourth century.
   Athanasius is far superior to any other historians of the period, both
   from his bearing for the most part a personal testimony to the facts he
   relates, and from his great accuracy and use of actual documents. On
   the other hand, Rufinus, Socrates, Sozomen, Theodoret, must not be used
   without extreme caution, unless they adduce documents, which is seldom
   the case." The Apology' is a personal defence by Athanasius against the
   charges laid against him by the Eusebian party, and does not directly
   concern matters of doctrine. After the Council of NicÃ¦a, the Eusebian
   policy had been to oust the principal opponents from their sees on
   personal grounds, so as to pave the way for the abrogation of the
   Nicene formula. The attack upon Athanasius began in 331, but without
   success. It was renewed at CÃ¦sarea and Tyre in 334-335, and resulted in
   the exile of Athanasius to Treveri, 336. His return in 337 was followed
   by a Synod at Antioch which deposed' him (close of 338), and by his
   expulsion in favour of Gregory (339). Then follow the intervention of
   Julius (339-340), and the Council of Sardica (343), which resulted in
   the eventual return of Athanasius in the autumn of 346. (The details
   are given more fully in the Prolegomena, ch. ii. Â§Â§4-6). After this
   latter date, and before the relapse of Valens and Ursacius which
   followed upon the death of Constans, Athanasius drew up a collection of
   documents in proof of his innocence, connecting them together by an
   explanatory narrative. (1) The charges against him related to events
   alleged to have occurred before the year 332 (extortion of money,
   subvention of the rebel Philumenus, the chalice of Ischyras, murder and
   mutilation of the bishop Arsenius): the principal evidence as to their
   falsehood was comprised in the proceedings of the Councils of Tyre and
   Jerusalem, and of the commission of enquiry sent by the assembled
   bishops to the Mareotis. (2) The judicial investigations which proved
   the innocence of Athanasius took place first at Rome under Julius,
   secondly at Sardica under Hosius; and were followed by the recognition
   of his innocence on the part of the Emperor Constantius, of bishops in
   various parts of the world, and lastly of some of his chief accusers.

   The method of defence now adopted by Athanasius was firstly to show how
   complete that recognition had been: this he does by a series of
   documents from the eve of his departure to Rome down to the recantation
   of Ursacius and Valens soon after his return to Alexandria: these
   documents cover eight years (339-347) previous to the composition of
   the Apology (Â§Â§1-58). Having shewn the completeness of his acquittal,
   he next gives the evidence upon which it was based. Accordingly the
   second part (Â§Â§59-90) of the Apology deals with facts and documents
   earlier than those comprised in the first. Hence the inversion of
   chronological sequence (prÃ¦posterus ordo, Montf.) as between the two
   parts.

   Referring the reader to the Prolegomena for a connected view of the
   history of which this Apology is the primary source, it will suffice
   for our present purpose to enumerate the documents quoted, with the
   briefest possible statement of their contents and bearing upon the
   general purpose of the work. It should be noted that while in the first
   part the documents follow one another in strict chronological order,
   those of the second part fall into groups within which the matters are
   arranged as best suits the argument, and not in order of time. In the
   following list the probable or approximate date of each document is
   given.

   a. DOCUMENTS IN THE FIRST PART (general subject, the vindication of
   Athanasius before the bishops of the Christian world).

   i. Documents Prior to the Council of Sardica (Â§Â§1-35).

   1. Â§Â§3-19 (end of 338 or beginning of 339). Circular of Egyptian
   bishops reciting the election of Athanasius, the plots and charges

   request of a Roman Council) remonstrating with their discourteous reply
   to a former letter, reciting the history of the intrigues against
   Athanasius, pressing them with their disrespect to the Synod of NicÃ¦a,
   with their evasion of the invitation to the Council at Rome,
   vindicating Athanasius (on the ground of documentary proof of his
   innocence, and on that of the irregularity of the proceedings against
   him) and Marcellus (upon his own statement of belief), lastly,
   insisting on the propriety of a reference of the questions at issue to
   the whole Church, and upon the precedent giving the Roman Church a
   decisive voice in questions affecting that of Alexandria.

   ii. Council of Sardica (Â§Â§36-50).

   3. Â§Â§36-40 (a.d. 343) Letter of the Council to the Church of

   Alexandrine Church to patience, and announcing that they have requested
   the Emperors to give effect to their decisions.

   4. Â§Â§41-43 (same date). Letter of the Council to the bishops of Egypt

   occasion of its assembling, the behaviour of the Eastern bishops, the

   leaders are deposed and anathematised. The signatures follow of over
   280 bishops, most of whom signed afterwards while the letter was in
   circulation.

   30-32. Protests made by Egyptian Clergy against the proceedings of the

   30. Â§73. Clergy of Alexandria to the Commissioners, protesting against
   the exclusion of all independent persons from the proceedings.

   31. Â§Â§74, 75. Clergy of the Mareotis to the Council, giving an account

   proceedings of the Commission.

   32. Â§76. The same to the Prefect and other officials of Egypt (dated

   Flavius Hemerius for the erection of a church for Ischyras.

   The two concluding sections (89, 90) of the Apology are a postscript
   added during the troubles under Constantius (about 358, see Introd. to
   Hist. Ar.). He points to the sufferings which many bishops, including
   Hosius and Liberius, had endured rather than surrender his cause, as
   fresh evidence of their belief in his innocence. He refuses to see any
   detraction from the force of this argument in the fall of the two
   bishops mentioned.

   The importance to the historian of this collection of documents need
   not be dwelt upon. If the charges in dispute seem trivial and even
   grotesque, they none the less illustrate the temper of the parties
   concerned, and the character of the controversy during the very
   important twenty years which end with the death of Constans and the
   reign of Constantius over the undivided Empire.

   Defence Against the Arians.

   ------------------------

   Introduction.

   1. I supposed that, after so many proofs of my innocence had been
   given, my enemies would have shrunk from further enquiry, and would now
   have condemned themselves for their false accusations of others. But as
   they are not yet abashed, though they have been so clearly convicted,
   but, as insensible to shame, persist in their slanderous reports
   against me, professing to think that the whole matter ought to be tried
   over again (not that they may have judgment passed on them, for that
   they avoid, but in order to harass me, and to disturb the minds of the
   simple); I therefore thought it necessary to make my defence unto you,
   that you may listen to their murmurings no longer, but may denounce
   their wickedness and base calumnies. And it is only to you, who are men
   of sincere minds, that I offer a defence: as for the contentious, I
   appeal confidently to the decisive proofs which I have against them.
   For my cause needs no further judgment; for judgment has already been
   given, and not once or twice only, but many times. First of all, it was
   tried in my own country in an assembly of nearly one hundred of its
   Bishops [472] ; a second time at Rome, when, in consequence of letters
   from Eusebius, both they and we were summoned, and more than fifty
   Bishops met [473] ; and a third time in the great Council assembled at
   Sardica by order of the most religious Emperors Constantius and
   Constans, when my enemies were degraded as false accusers, and the
   sentence that was passed in my favour received the suffrages of more
   than three hundred Bishops, out of the provinces of Egypt, Libya, and
   Pentapolis, Palestine, Arabia, Isauria, Cyprus, Pamphylia, Lycia,
   Galatia, Dacia, Moesia, Thrace, Dardania, Macedonia, Epirus, Thessaly,
   Achaia, Crete, Dalmatia, Siscia, Pannonia, Noricum, Italy, Picenum,
   Tuscany, Campania, Calabria, Apulia, Bruttia, Sicily, the whole of
   Africa, Sardinia, Spain, Gaul, and Britain.

   Added to these was the testimony [474] of Ursacius and Valens, who had
   formerly calumniated me, but afterwards changed their minds, and not
   only gave their assent to the sentence that was passed in my favour,
   but also confessed that they themselves and the rest of my enemies were
   false accusers; for men who make such a change and such a recantation
   of course reflect upon Eusebius and his fellows, for with them they had
   contrived the plot against me. Now after a matter has been examined and
   decided on such clear evidence by so many eminent Bishops, every one
   will confess that further discussion is unnecessary; else, if an
   investigation be instituted at this time, it may be again discussed and
   again investigated, and there will be no end to such trifling.

   2. Now the decision of so many Bishops was sufficient to confound those
   who would still fain pretend some charge against me. But when my
   enemies also bear testimony in my favour and against themselves,
   declaring that the proceedings against me were a conspiracy, who is
   there that would not be ashamed to doubt any longer? The law requires
   that in the mouth of two or three witnesses [475] judgments shall be
   settled, and we have here this great multitude of witnesses in my
   favour, with the addition of the proofs afforded by my enemies; so much
   so that those who still continue opposed to me no longer attach any
   importance to their own arbitrary [476] judgment, but now have recourse
   to violence, and in the place of fair reasoning seek to injure [477]
   those by whom they were exposed. For this is the chief cause of
   vexation to them, that the measures they carried on in secret,
   contrived by themselves in a corner, have been brought to light and
   disclosed by Valens and Ursacius; for they are well aware that their
   recantation while it clears those whom they have injured, condemns
   themselves.

   Indeed this led to their degradation in the Council of Sardica, as
   mentioned before; and with good reason; for, as the Pharisees of old,
   when they undertook the defence of Paul [478] , fully exposed the
   conspiracy which they and the Jews had formed against him; and as the
   blessed David was proved to be persecuted unjustly when the persecutor
   confessed, I have sinned, my son David [479] ;' so it was with these
   men; being overcome by the truth they made a request, and delivered it
   in writing to Julius, Bishop of Rome. They wrote also to me requesting
   to be on terms of peace with me, though they have spread such reports
   concerning me; and probably even now they are covered with shame, on
   seeing that those whom they sought to destroy by the grace of the Lord
   are still alive. Consistently also with this conduct they anathematized
   Arius and his heresy; for knowing that Eusebius and his fellows had
   conspired against me in behalf of their own misbelief, and of nothing
   else, as soon as they had determined to confess their calumnies against
   me, they immediately renounced also that antichristian heresy for the
   sake of which they had falsely asserted them.

   The following are the letters written in my favour by the Bishops in
   the several Councils and first the letter of the Egyptian Bishops.

   Encyclical Letter of the Council of Egypt.

   The holy Council assembled at Alexandria out of Egypt, the Thebais,
   Libya, and Pentapolis, to the Bishops of the Catholic Church
   everywhere, brethren beloved and greatly longed for in the Lord,
   greeting.

   3. Dearly beloved brethren, we might have put forth a defence of our
   brother Athanasius as respects the conspiracy of Eusebius and his
   fellows against him, and complained of his sufferings at their hands,
   and have exposed all their false charges, either at the beginning of
   their conspiracy or upon his arrival at Alexandria. But circumstances
   did not permit it then, as you also know; and lately, after the return
   of the Bishop Athanasius, we thought that they would be confounded and
   covered with shame at their manifest injustice: in consequence we
   prevailed with ourselves to remain silent. Since, however, after all
   his severe sufferings, after his retirement into Gaul, after his
   sojourn in a foreign and far distant country in the place of his own,
   after his narrow escape from death through their calumnies, but thanks
   to the clemency of the Emperor,--distress which would have satisfied
   even the most cruel enemy,--they are still insensible to shame, are
   again acting insolently against the Church and Athanasius; and from
   indignation at his deliverance venture on still more atrocious schemes
   against him, and are ready with an accusation, fearless of the words in
   holy Scripture [480] , A false witness shall not be unpunished;' and,
   The mouth that belieth slayeth the soul;' we therefore are unable
   longer to hold our peace, being amazed at their wickedness and at the
   insatiable love of contention displayed in their intrigues.

   For see, they cease not to disturb the ear of royalty with fresh
   reports against us; they cease not to write letters of deadly import,
   for the destruction of the Bishop who is the enemy of their impiety.
   For again have they written to the Emperors against him; again they
   wish to conspire against him, charging him with a butchery which has
   never taken place; again they wish to shed his blood, accusing him of a
   murder that never was committed (for at that former time would they
   have murdered him by their calumnies, had we not had a kind Emperor);
   again they are urgent, to say the least, that he should be sent into
   banishment, while they pretend to lament the miseries of those alleged
   to have been exiled by him. They lament before us things that have
   never been done, and, not satisfied with what has been done to him,
   desire to add thereto other and more cruel treatment. So mild are they
   and merciful, and of so just a disposition; or rather (for the truth
   shall be spoken) so wicked are they and malicious; obtaining respect
   through fear and by threats, rather than by their piety and justice, as
   becomes Bishops. They have dared in their letters to the Emperors to
   pour forth language such as no contentious person would employ even
   among those that are without; they have charged him with a number of
   murders and butcheries, and that not before a Governor, or any other
   superior officer, but before the three Augusti; nor shrink they from
   any journey however long, provided only all greater courts may be
   filled with their accusations. For indeed, dearly beloved, their
   business consists in accusations, and that of the most solemn
   character, forasmuch as the tribunals to which they make their appeal
   are the most solemn of any upon earth. And what other end do they
   propose by these investigations, except to move the Emperor to capital
   punishment?

   4. Their own conduct therefore, and not that of Athanasius, is the
   fittest subject for lamentation and mourning, and one would more
   properly lament them, for such actions ought to be bewailed, since it
   is written, Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep sore
   for him that goeth away, for he shall return no more [481] .' For their
   whole letter contemplates nothing but death; and their endeavour is to
   kill, whenever they may be permitted, or if not, to drive into exile.
   And this they were permitted to do by the most religious father of the
   Emperors, who gratified their fury by the banishment of Athanasius
   [482] , instead of his death. Now that this is not the conduct even of
   ordinary Christians, scarcely even of heathens, much less of Bishops,
   who profess to teach others righteousness, we suppose that your
   Christian consciences must at once perceive. How can they forbid others
   to accuse their brethren, who themselves become their accusers, and
   that to the Emperors? How can they teach compassion for the misfortunes
   of others, who cannot rest satisfied even with our banishment? For
   there was confessedly a general sentence of banishment against us
   Bishops, and we all looked upon ourselves as banished men: and now
   again we consider ourselves as restored with Athanasius to our native
   places, and instead of our former lamentations and mourning over him,
   as having the greatest encouragement and grace,--which may the Lord
   continue to us, nor suffer Eusebius and his fellows to destroy?

   Even if their charges against him were true, here is a certain charge
   against them, that against the precept of Christianity, and after his
   banishment and trials, they have assaulted him again, and accuse him of
   murder, and butchery, and other crimes, which they sound in the royal
   ears against the Bishops. But how manifold is their wickedness, and
   what manner of men think you them, when every word they speak is false,
   every charge they bring a calumny, and there is no truth whatever
   either in their mouths or their writings! Let us then at length enter
   upon these matters, and meet their last charges. This will prove, that
   in their former representations in the Council [483] and at the trial
   their conduct was dishonourable, or rather their words untrue, besides
   exposing them for what they have now advanced.

   5. We are indeed ashamed to make any defence against such charges. But
   since our reckless accusers lay hold of any charge, and allege that
   murders and butcheries were committed after the return of Athanasius,
   we beseech you to bear with our answer though it be somewhat long; for
   circumstances constrain us. No murder has been committed either by
   Athanasius or on his account, since our accusers, as we said before,
   compel us to enter upon this humiliating defence. Slaughter and
   imprisonment are foreign to our Church. No one did Athanasius commit
   into the hands of the executioner; and the prison, so far as he was
   concerned, was never disturbed. Our sanctuaries are now, as they have
   always been, pure, and honoured only with the Blood of Christ and His
   pious worship. Neither Presbyter nor Deacon was destroyed by
   Athanasius; he perpetrated no murder, he caused the banishment of no
   one. Would that they had never caused the like to him, nor given him
   actual experience of it! No one here has been banished on his account;
   no one at all except Athanasius himself, the Bishop of Alexandria, whom
   they banished, and whom, now that he is restored, they again seek to
   entangle in the same or even a more cruel plot than before, setting
   their tongues to speak all manner of false and deadly words against
   him.

   For, behold, they now attribute to him the acts of the magistrates; and
   although they plainly confess in their letter that the Prefect of Egypt
   passed sentence upon certain persons, they now are not ashamed to
   impute this sentence to Athanasius; and that, though he had not at the
   time entered Alexandria, but was yet on his return from his place of
   exile. Indeed he was then in Syria; since we must needs adduce in
   defence his length of way from home, that a man may not be responsible
   for the actions of a Governor or Prefect of Egypt. But supposing
   Athanasius had been in Alexandria, what were the proceedings of the
   Prefect to Athanasius? However, he was not even in the country; and
   what the Prefect of Egypt did was not done on ecclesiastical grounds,
   but for reasons which you will learn from the records, which, after we
   understood what they had written, we made diligent enquiry for, and
   have transmitted to you. Since then they now raise a cry against
   certain things which were never done either by him or for him, as
   though they had certainly taken place, and testify against such evils
   as though they were assured of their existence; let them inform us from
   what Council they obtained their knowledge of them, from what proofs,
   and from what judicial investigation? But if they have no such evidence
   to bring forward, and nothing but their own mere assertion, we leave it
   to you to consider as regards their former charges also, how the things
   took place, and why they so speak of them. In truth, it is nothing but
   calumny, and a plot of our enemies, and a temper of ungovernable mood,
   and an impiety in behalf of the Arian madmen which is frantic against
   true godliness, and desires to root out the orthodox, so that
   henceforth the advocates of impiety may preach without fear whatever
   doctrines they please. The history of the matter is as follows:--

   6. When Arius, from whom the heresy of the Arian madmen has its name,
   was cast out of the Church for his impiety by Bishop Alexander, of
   blessed memory, Eusebius and his fellows, who are the disciples and
   partners of his impiety, considering themselves also to have been
   ejected, wrote frequently to Bishop Alexander, beseeching him not to
   leave the heretic Arius out of the Church [484] . But when Alexander in
   his piety towards Christ refused to admit that impious man, they
   directed their resentment against Athanasius, who was then a Deacon,
   because in their busy enquiries they had heard that he was much in the
   familiarity of Bishop Alexander, and much honoured by him. And their
   hatred of him was greatly increased after they had experience of his
   piety towards Christ, in the Council assembled at NicÃ¦a [485] , wherein
   he spoke boldly against the impiety of the Arian madmen. But when God
   raised him to the Episcopate, their long-cherished malice burst forth
   into a flame, and fearing his orthodoxy and resistance of their
   impiety, they (and especially Eusebius [486] , who was smitten with a
   consciousness of his own evil doings), engaged in all manner of
   treacherous designs against him. They prejudiced the Emperor against
   him; they frequently threatened him with Councils; and at last
   assembled at Tyre; and to this day they cease not to write against him,
   and are so implacable that they even find fault with his appointment to
   the Episcopate [487] , taking every means of shewing their enmity and
   hatred towards him, and spreading false reports for the sole purpose of
   thereby vilifying his character.

   However, the very misrepresentations which they now are making do but
   convict their former statements of being falsehoods, and a mere
   conspiracy against him. For they say, that after the death of Bishop
   Alexander, a certain few having mentioned the name of Athanasius, six
   or seven Bishops elected him clandestinely in a secret place:' and this
   is what they wrote to the Emperors, having no scruple about asserting
   the greatest falsehoods. Now that the whole multitude and all the
   people of the Catholic Church assembled together as with one mind and
   body, and cried, shouted, that Athanasius should be Bishop of their
   Church, made this the subject of their public prayers to Christ, and
   conjured us to grant it for many days and nights, neither departing
   themselves from the Church, nor suffering us to do so; of all this we
   are witnesses, and so is the whole city, and the province too. Not a
   word did they speak against him, as these persons represented, but gave
   him the most excellent titles they could devise, calling him good,
   pious, Christian, an ascetic [488] , a genuine Bishop. And that he was
   elected by a majority of our body in the sight and with the
   acclamations of all the people, we who elected him also testify, who
   are surely more credible witnesses than those who were not present, and
   now spread these false accounts.

   But yet Eusebius finds fault with the appointment of Athanasius,--he
   who perhaps never received any appointment to his office at all; or if
   he did, has himself rendered it invalid [489] . For he had first the
   See of Berytus, but leaving that he came to Nicomedia. He left the one
   contrary to the law, and contrary to the law invaded the other; having
   deserted his own without affection, and holding possession of another's
   without reason; he lost his love for the first in his lust for another,
   without even keeping to that which he obtained at the prompting of his
   lust. For, behold, withdrawing himself from the second, again he takes
   possession of another's [490] , casting an evil eye all around him upon
   the cities of other men, and thinking that godliness [491] consists in
   wealth and in the greatness of cities, and making light of the heritage
   of God to which he had been appointed; not knowing that where' even two
   or three are gathered in the name of the' Lord, there' is the Lord in
   the midst of them;' not considering the words of the Apostle, I will
   not boast in another man's labours;' not perceiving the charge which he
   has given, Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed.' For if
   this expression applies to a wife, how much more does it apply to a
   Church, and to the same Episcopate; to which whosoever is bound ought
   not to seek another, lest he prove an adulterer according to holy
   Scripture.

   7. But though conscious of these his own misdoings, he has boldly
   undertaken to arraign the appointment of Athanasius, to which
   honourable testimony has been borne by all, and he ventures to reproach
   him with his deposition, though he has been deposed himself, and has a
   standing proof of his deposition in the appointment of another in his
   room. How could either he or Theognius [492] depose another, after they
   had been deposed themselves, which is sufficiently proved by the
   appointment of others in their room? For you know very well that there
   were appointed instead of them Amphion to Nicomedia and Chrestus to
   NicÃ¦a, in consequence of their own impiety and connection with the
   Arian madmen, who were rejected by the Ecumenic Council. But while they
   desire to set aside that true Council, they endeavour to give that name
   to their own unlawful combination [493] ; while they are unwilling that
   the decrees of the Council should be enforced, they desire to enforce
   their own decisions; and they use the name of a Council, while they
   refuse to submit themselves to one so great as this. Thus they care not
   for Councils, but only pretend to do so in order that they may root out
   the orthodox, and annul the decrees of the true and great Council
   against the Arians, in support of whom, both now and heretofore, they
   have ventured to assert these falsehoods against the Bishop Athanasius.
   For their former statements resembled those they now falsely make,
   viz., that disorderly meetings were held at his entrance [494] , with
   lamentation and mourning, the people indignantly refusing to receive
   him. Now such was not the case, but, quite the contrary, joy and
   cheerfulness prevailed, and the people ran together, hastening to
   obtain the desired sight of him. The churches were full of rejoicings,
   and thanksgivings were offered up to the Lord everywhere; and all the
   Ministers and Clergy beheld him with such feelings, that their souls
   were possessed with delight, and they esteemed that the happiest day of
   their lives. Why need we mention the inexpressible joy that prevailed
   among us Bishops, for we have already said that we counted ourselves to
   have been partakers in his sufferings?

   8. Now this being confessedly the truth of the matter, although it is
   very differently represented by them, what weight can be attached to
   that Council or trial of which they make their boast? Since they
   presume thus to interfere in a case which they did not witness, which
   they have not examined, and for which they did not meet, and to write
   as though they were assured of the truth of their statements, how can
   they claim credit respecting these matters for the consideration of
   which they say that they did meet together? Will it not rather be
   believed that they have acted both in the one case and in the other out
   of enmity to us? For what kind of a Council of Bishops was then held?
   Was it an assembly which aimed at the truth? Was not almost every one
   among them our enemy [495] ? Did not the attack of Eusebius and his
   fellows upon us proceed from their zeal for the Arian madness? Did they
   not urge on the others of their party? Have we not always written
   against them as professing the doctrines of Arius? Was not Eusebius of
   CÃ¦sarea in Palestine accused by our confessors of sacrificing to idols
   [496] ? Was not George proved to have been deposed by the blessed
   Alexander [497] ? Were not they charged with various offences, some
   with this, some with that?

   How then could such men entertain the purpose of holding a meeting
   against us? How can they have the boldness to call that a Council, at
   which a Count presided, which an executioner attended, and where an
   usher [498] instead of the Deacons of the Church introduced us into
   Court; and where the Count only spoke, and all present held their
   peace, or rather obeyed his directions [499] ? The removal of those
   Bishops who seemed to deserve it was prevented at his desire; and when
   he gave the order we were dragged about by soldiers;--or rather
   Eusebius and his fellows gave the order, and he was subservient to
   their will. In short, dearly beloved, what kind of Council was that,
   the object of which was banishment and murder at the pleasure of the
   Emperor? And of what nature were their charges?--for here is matter of
   still greater astonishment. There was one Arsenius whom they declared
   to have been murdered; and they also complained that a chalice
   belonging to the sacred mysteries had been broken.

   Now Arsenius is alive, and prays to be admitted to our communion. He
   waits for no other testimony to prove that he is still living, but
   himself confesses it, writing in his own person to our brother
   Athanasius, whom they positively asserted to be his murderer. The
   impious wretches were not ashamed to accuse him of having murdered a
   man who was at a great distance from him, being separated by so great a
   distance, whether by sea or land, and whose abode at that time no one
   knew. Nay, they even had the boldness to remove him out of sight, and
   place him in concealment, though he had suffered no injury; and, if it
   had been possible, they would have transported him to another world,
   nay, or have taken him from life in earnest, so that either by a true
   or false statement of his murder they might in good earnest destroy
   Athanasius. But thanks to divine Providence for this also which
   permitted them not to succeed in their injustice, but presented
   Arsenius [500] alive to the eyes of all men, who has clearly proved
   their conspiracy and calumnies. He does not withdraw from us as
   murderers, nor hate us as having injured him (for indeed he has
   suffered no evil at all); but he desires to hold communion with us; he
   wishes to be numbered among us, and has written to this effect.

   9. Nevertheless they laid their plot against Athanasius, accusing him
   of having murdered a person who was still alive; and those same men are
   the authors of his banishment [501] . For it was not the father of the
   Emperors, but their calumnies, that sent him into exile. Consider
   whether this is not the truth. When nothing was discovered to the
   prejudice of our fellow-minister Athanasius, but still the Count
   threatened him with violence, and was very zealous against him, the
   Bishop [502] fled from this violence and went up [503] to the most
   religious Emperor, where he protested against the Count and their
   conspiracy against him, and requested either that a lawful Council of
   Bishops might be assembled, or that the Emperor would himself receive
   his defence concerning the charges they brought against him. Upon this
   the Emperor wrote in anger, summoning them before him, and declaring
   that he would hear the cause himself, and for that purpose he also
   ordered a Council to be held. Whereupon Eusebius and his fellows went
   up and falsely charged Athanasius, not with the same offences which
   they had published against him at Tyre, but with an intention of
   detaining the vessels laden with corn, as though Athanasius had been
   the man to pretend that he could stop the exports of corn from
   Alexandria to Constantinople [504] .

   Certain of our friends were present at the palace with Athanasius, and
   heard the threats of the Emperor upon receiving this report. And when
   Athanasius cried out upon the calumny, and positively declared that it
   was not true, (for how, he argued, should he a poor man, and in a
   private station, be able to do such a thing?) Eusebius did not hesitate
   publicly to repeat the charge, and swore that Athanasius was a rich
   man, and powerful, and able to do anything; in order that it might
   thence be supposed that he had used this language. Such was the
   accusation these venerable Bishops proffered against him. But the grace
   of God proved superior to their wickedness, for it moved the pious
   Emperor to mercy, who instead of death passed upon him the sentence of
   banishment. Thus their calumnies, and nothing else, were the cause of
   this. For the Emperor, in the letter which he previously wrote,
   complained of their conspiracy, censured their machinations, and
   condemned the Meletians as unscrupulous and deserving of execration; in
   short, expressed himself in the severest terms concerning them. For he
   was greatly moved when he heard the story of the dead alive; he was
   moved at hearing of murder in the case of one alive, and not deprived
   of life. We have sent you the letter.

   10. But these marvellous men, Eusebius and his fellows, to make a show
   of refuting the truth of the case, and the statements contained in this
   letter, put forward the name of a Council, and ground its proceedings
   upon the authority of the Emperor. Hence the attendance of a Count at
   their meeting, and the soldiers as guards of the Bishops, and royal
   letters compelling the attendance of any persons whom they required.
   But observe here the strange character of their machinations, and the
   inconsistency of their bold measures, so that by some means or other
   they may take Athanasius away from us. For if as Bishops they claimed
   for themselves alone the judgment of the case, what need was there for
   the attendance of a Count and soldiers? or how was it that they
   assembled under the sanction of royal letters? Or if they required the
   Emperor's countenance and wished to derive their authority from him,
   why were they then annulling his judgment? and when he declared in the
   letter which he wrote, that the Meletians were calumniators,
   unscrupulous, and that Athanasius was most innocent, and made much stir
   about the pretended murder of the living, how was it that they
   determined that the Meletians had spoken the truth, and that Athanasius
   was guilty of the offence; and were not ashamed to make the living
   dead, living both after the Emperor's judgment, and at the time when
   they met together, and who even until this day is amongst us? So much
   concerning the case of Arsenius.

   11. And as for the cup belonging to the mysteries, what was it, or
   where was it broken by Macarius? for this is the report which they
   spread up and down. But as for Athanasius, even his accusers would not
   have ventured to blame him, had they not been suborned by them.
   However, they attribute the origin of the offence to him; although it
   ought not to be imputed even to Macarius who is clear of it. And they
   are not ashamed to parade the sacred mysteries before Catechumens, and
   worse than that, even before heathens [505] : whereas, they ought to
   attend to what is written, It is good to keep close the secret of a
   king [506] ;' and as the Lord has charged us, Give not that which is
   holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine [507] .'
   We ought not then to parade the holy mysteries before the uninitiated,
   lest the heathen in their ignorance deride them, and the Catechumens
   being over-curious be offended. However, what was the cup, and where
   and before whom was it broken? It is the Meletians who make the
   accusation, who are not worthy of the least credit, for they have been
   schismatics and enemies of the Church, not of a recent date, but from
   the times of the blessed Peter, Bishop and Martyr [508] . They formed a
   conspiracy against Peter himself; they calumniated his successor
   Achillas; they accused Alexander even before the Emperor; and being
   thus well versed in these arts, they have now transferred their enmity
   to Athanasius, acting altogether in accordance with their former
   wickedness. For as they slandered those that have been before him, so
   now they have slandered him. But their calumnies and false accusations
   have never prevailed against him until now, that they have got Eusebius
   and his fellows for their assistants and patrons, on account of the
   impiety which these have adopted from the Arian madmen, which has led
   them to conspire against many Bishops, and among the rest Athanasius.

   Now the place where they say the cup was broken, was not a Church;
   there was no Presbyter in occupation of the place; and the day on which
   they say that Macarius did the deed, was not the Lord's day. Since then
   there was no church there; since there was no one to perform the sacred
   office; and since the day did not require the use of it [509] ; what
   was this cup belonging to the mysteries, and when, or where was it
   broken? There are many cups, it is plain, both in private houses, and
   in the public market; and if a person breaks one of them, he is not
   guilty of impiety. But the cup which belongs to the mysteries, and
   which if it be broken intentionally, makes the perpetrator of the deed
   an impious person, is found only among those who lawfully preside. This
   is the only description that can be given of this kind of cup; there is
   none other; this you legally give to the people to drink; this you have
   received according to the canon of the Church [510] ; this belongs only
   to those who preside over the Catholic Church, for to you only it
   appertains to administer the Blood of Christ, and to none besides. But
   as he who breaks the cup belonging to the mysteries is an impious
   person, much more impious is he who treats the Blood of Christ with
   contumely: and he does so who does this [511] ' contrary to the rule of
   the Church. (We say this, not as if a cup even of the schismatics was
   broken by Macarius, for there was no cup there at all; how should there
   be? where there was neither Lord's house nor any the belonging to the
   Church, nay, it was not the time of the celebration of the mysteries).
   Now such a person is the notorious Ischyras, who was never appointed to
   his office by the Church, and when Alexander admitted the Presbyters
   that had been ordained by Meletius, he was not even numbered amongst
   them; and therefore did not receive ordination even from that quarter.

   12. By what means then did Ischyras become a Presbyter? who was it that
   ordained him? was it Colluthus? for this is the only supposition that
   remains. But it is well known and no one has any doubt about the matter
   that Colluthus died a Presbyter, and that every ordination of his was
   invalid, and that all that were ordained by him during the schism were
   reduced to the condition of laymen, and in that rank appear in the
   congregation. How then can it be believed that a private person,
   occupying a private house had in his possession a sacred chalice? But
   the truth is, they gave the name of Presbyter at the time to a private
   person, and gratified him with this title to support him in his
   iniquitous conduct towards us; and now as the reward of his accusations
   they procure for him the erection of a Church [512] . So that this man
   had then no Church; but as the reward of his malice and subserviency to
   them in accusing us, he receives now what he had not before; nay,
   perhaps they have even remunerated his services with the Episcopate,
   for so he goes about reporting, and accordingly behaves towards us with
   great insolence. Thus are such rewards as these now bestowed by Bishops
   upon accusers and calumniators though indeed it is reasonable, in the
   case of an accomplice, that as they have made him a partner in their
   proceedings, so they should also make him their associate in their own
   Episcopate. But this is not all; give ear yet further to their
   proceedings at that time.

   13. Being unable to prevail against the truth, though they had thus set
   themselves in array against it, and Ischyras having proved nothing at
   Tyre, but being shewn to be a calumniator, and the calumny ruining
   their plot, they defer proceedings for fresh evidence, and profess that
   they are going to send to the Mareotis certain of their party to
   enquire diligently into the matter. Accordingly they dispatched
   secretly, with the assistance of the civil power, persons to whom we
   openly objected on many accounts, as being of the party of Arius, and
   therefore our enemies; namely, Diognius [513] , Maris, Theodorus,
   Macedonius, and two others, young both in years and mind [514] ,
   Ursacius and Valens from Pannonia; who, after they had undertaken this
   long journey for the purpose of sitting in judgment upon their enemy,
   set out again from Tyre for Alexandria. They did not shrink from
   becoming witnesses themselves, although they were the judges, but
   openly adopted every means of furthering their design, and undertook
   any labour or journey whatsoever in order to bring to a successful
   issue the conspiracy which was in progress. They left the Bishop
   Athanasius detained in a foreign country while they themselves entered
   their enemy's city, as if to have their revel both against his Church
   and against his people. And what was more outrageous still, they took
   with them the accuser Ischyras, but would not permit Macarius, the
   accused person, to accompany them, but left him in custody at Tyre. For
   Macarius the Presbyter of Alexandria' was made answerable for the
   charge far and near.

   14. They therefore entered Alexandria alone with the accuser, their
   partner in lodging, board, and cup; and taking with them Philagrius the
   Prefect of Egypt they proceeded to the Mareotis, and there carried on
   the so-called investigation by themselves, all their own way, with the
   forementioned person. Although the Presbyters frequently begged that
   they might be present, they would not permit them. The Presbyters both
   of the city and of the whole country desired to attend, that they might
   detect who and whence the persons were who were suborned by Ischyras.
   But they forbade the Ministers to be present, while they carried on the
   examination concerning church, cup, table, and the holy things, before
   the heathen; nay, worse than that, they summoned heathen witnesses
   during the enquiry concerning a cup belonging to the mysteries; and
   those persons who they affirmed were taken out of the way by Athanasius
   by summons of the Receiver-general, and they knew not where in the
   world they were, these same individuals they brought forward before
   themselves and the Prefect only, and avowedly used their testimony,
   whom they affirmed without shame to have been secreted by the Bishop
   Athanasius.

   But here too their only object is to effect his death, and so they
   again pretend that persons are dead who are still alive, following the
   same method they adopted in the case of Arsenius. For the men are
   living, and are to be seen in their own country; but to you who are at
   a great distance from the spot they make a great stir about the matter
   as though they had disappeared, in order that, as the evidence is so
   far removed from you, they may falsely accuse our brother-minister, as
   though he used violence and the civil power; whereas they themselves
   have in all respects acted by means of that power and the countenance
   of others. For their proceedings in the Mareotis were parallel to those
   at Tyre; and as there a Count attended with military assistance, and
   would permit nothing either to be said or done contrary to their
   pleasure, so here also the Prefect of Egypt was present with a band of
   men, frightening all the members of the Church, and permitting no one
   to give true testimony. And what was the strangest thing of all, the
   persons who came, whether as judges or witnesses, or, what was more
   likely, in order to serve their own purposes and those of Eusebius,
   lived in the same place with the accuser, even in his house, and there
   seemed to carry on the investigation as they pleased.

   15. We suppose you are not ignorant what outrages they committed at
   Alexandria; for they are reported everywhere. Naked swords [515] were
   at work against the holy virgins and brethren; scourges were at work
   against their persons, esteemed honourable in the sight of God, so that
   their feet were lamed by the stripes, whose souls are whole and sound
   in purity and all good works [516] . The trades were excited against
   them; and the heathen multitude was set to strip them naked, to beat
   them, wantonly to insult them, and to threaten them with their altars
   and sacrifices. And one coarse fellow, as though license had now been
   given them by the Prefect in order to gratify the Bishops, took hold of
   a virgin by the hand, and dragged her towards an altar that happened to
   be near, imitating the practice of compelling to offer sacrifice in
   time of persecution. When this was done, the virgins took to flight,
   and a shout of laughter was raised by the heathen against the Church;
   the Bishops being in the place, and occupying the very house where this
   was going on; and from which, in order to obtain favour with them, the
   virgins were assaulted with naked swords, and were exposed to all kinds
   of danger, and insult, and wanton violence. And this treatment they
   received on a fast-day [517] , and at the hands of persons who
   themselves were feasting with the Bishops indoors.

   16. Foreseeing these things, and reflecting that the entrance of
   enemies into a place is no ordinary calamity, we protested against this
   commission. And Alexander [518] , Bishop of Thessalonica, considering
   the same, wrote to the people residing there, discovering the
   conspiracy, and testifying of the plot. They indeed reckon him to be
   one of themselves, and account him a partner in their designs; but they
   only prove thereby the violence they have exercised towards him. For
   even the profligate Ischyras himself was only induced by fear and
   violence to proceed in the matter, and was obliged by force to
   undertake the accusation. As a proof of this, he wrote himself to our
   brother Athanasius [519] , confessing that nothing of the kind that was
   alleged had taken place there, but that he was suborned to make a false
   statement. This declaration he made, though he was never admitted by
   Athanasius as a Presbyter, nor received such a title of grace from him,
   nor was entrusted by way of recompense with the erection of a Church,
   nor expected the bribe of a Bishopric; all of which he obtained from
   them in return for undertaking the accusation. Moreover, his whole
   family held communion with us [520] , which they would not have done
   had they been injured in the slightest degree.

   17. Now to prove that these things are facts and not mere assertions,
   we have the testimony [521] of all the Presbyters of the Mareotis [522]
   , who always accompany the Bishop in his visitations, and who also
   wrote at the time against Ischyras. But neither those of them who came
   to Tyre were allowed to declare the truth [523] , nor could those who
   remained in the Mareotis obtain permission to refute the calumnies of
   Ischyras [524] . The copies also of the letters of Alexander, and of
   the Presbyters, and of Ischyras will prove the same thing. We have sent
   also the letter of the father of the Emperors, in which he expresses
   his indignation that the murder of Arsenius was charged upon any one
   while the man was still alive; as also his astonishment at the variable
   and inconsistent character of their accusations with respect to the
   cup; since at one time they accused the Presbyter Macarius, at another
   the Bishop Athanasius, of having broken it with his hands. He declares
   also on the one hand that the Meletians are calumniators, and on the
   other that Athanasius is perfectly innocent.

   And are not the Meletians calumniators, and above all John [525] , who
   after coming into the Church, and communicating with us, after
   condemning himself, and no longer taking any part in the proceedings
   respecting the cup, when he saw Eusebius and his fellows zealously
   supporting the Arian madmen, though they had not the daring to
   co-operate with them openly, but were attempting to employ others as
   their masks, undertook a character, as an actor in the heathen theatres
   [526] ? The subject of the drama was a contest of Arians; the real
   design of the piece being their success, but John and his partizans
   being put on the stage and playing the parts, in order that under
   colour of these, the supporters of the Arians in the garb of judges
   might drive away the enemies of their impiety, firmly establish their
   impious doctrines, and bring the Arians into the Church. And those who
   wish to drive out true religion strive all they can to prevail by
   irreligion; they who have chosen the part of that impiety which wars
   against Christ, endeavour to destroy the enemies thereof, as though
   they were impious persons; and they impute to us the breaking of the
   cup, for the purpose of making it appear that Athanasius, equally with
   themselves, is guilty of impiety towards Christ.

   For what means this mention of a cup belonging to the mysteries by
   them? Whence comes this religious regard for the cup among those who
   support impiety towards Christ? Whence comes it that Christ's cup is
   known to them who know not Christ? How can they who profess to honour
   that cup, dishonour the God of the cup? or how can they who lament over
   the cup, seek to murder the Bishop who celebrates the mysteries
   therewith? for they would have murdered him, had it been in their
   power. And how can they who lament the loss of the throne that was
   Episcopally covered [527] , seek to destroy the Bishop that sat upon
   it, to the end that both the throne may be without its Bishop, and that
   the people may be deprived of godly doctrine? It was not then the cup,
   nor the murder, nor any of those portentous deeds they talk about, that
   induced them to act thus; but the forementioned heresy of the Arians,
   for the sake of which they conspired against Athanasius and other
   Bishops, and still continue to wage war against the Church.

   Who are they that have really been the cause of murders and
   banishments? Is it not these? Who are they that, availing themselves of
   external support, conspire against the Bishops? Are not Eusebius and
   his fellows the men, and not Athanasius, as they say in their letters?
   Both he and others have suffered at their hands. Even at the time of
   which we speak, four Presbyters [528] of Alexandria, though they had
   not even proceeded to Tyre, were banished by their means. Who then are
   they whose conduct calls for tears and lamentations? Is it not they,
   who after they have been guilty of one course of persecution, do not
   scruple to add to it a second, but have recourse to all manner of
   falsehood, in order that they may destroy a Bishop who will not give
   way to their impious heresy? Hence arises the enmity of Eusebius and
   his fellows; hence their proceedings at Tyre; hence their pretended
   trials; hence also now the letters which they have written even without
   any trial, expressing the utmost confidence in their statements; hence
   their calumnies before the father of the Emperors, and before the most
   religious Emperors themselves.

   18. For it is necessary that you should know what is now reported to
   the prejudice of our fellow-minister Athanasius, in order that you may
   thereby be led to condemn their wickedness, and may perceive that they
   desire nothing else but to murder him. A quantity of corn was given by
   the father of the Emperors for the support of certain widows, partly of
   Libya, and partly certain out of Egypt. They have all received it up to
   this time, Athanasius getting nothing therefrom, but the trouble of
   assisting them. But now, although the recipients themselves make no
   complaint, but acknowledge that they have received it, Athanasius has
   been accused of selling all the corn, and appropriating the profits to
   his own use: and the Emperor wrote to this effect about it, charging
   him with the offence in consequence of the calumnies which had been
   raised against him. Now who are they which have raised these calumnies?
   Is it not those who after they have been guilty of one course of
   persecution, scruple not to set on foot another? Who are the authors of
   those letters which are said to have come from the Emperor? Are not the
   Arians, who are so zealous against Athanasius, and scruple not to speak
   and write anything against him? No one would pass over persons who have
   acted as they have done, in order to entertain suspicion of others.
   Nay, the proof of their calumny appears to be most evident for they are
   anxious under cover of it, to take away the corn from the Church, and
   to give it to the Arians. And this circumstance more than any other,
   brings the matter home to the authors of this design and their
   principals, who scrupled neither to set on foot a charge of murder
   against Athanasius, as a base means of prejudicing the Emperor against
   him, nor yet to take away from the Clergy of the Church the subsistence
   of the poor, in order that in fact they might make gain for the
   heretics.

   19. We have sent also the testimony of our fellow-ministers in Libya,
   Pentapolis, and Egypt, from which likewise you may learn the false
   accusations which have been brought against Athanasius. And these
   things they do, in order that, the professors of true godliness being
   henceforth induced by fear to remain quiet, the heresy of the impious
   Arians may be brought in in its stead. But thanks be to your piety,
   dearly beloved, that you have frequently anathematized the Arians in
   your letters, and have never given them admittance into the Church. The
   exposure of Eusebius and his fellows is also easy and ready at hand.
   For behold, after their former letters concerning the Arians, of which
   also we have sent you copies, they now openly stir up the Arian madmen
   against the Church, though the whole Catholic Church has anathematized
   them; they have appointed a Bishop [529] over them; they distract the
   Churches with threats and alarms, that they may gain assistants in
   their impiety in every part. Moreover, they send Deacons to the Arian
   madmen, who openly join their assemblies; they write letters to them,
   and receive answers from them, thus making schisms in the Church, and
   holding communion with them; and they send to every part, commending
   their heresy, and repudiating the Church, as you will perceive from the
   letters they have addressed to the Bishop of Rome [530] and perhaps to
   yourselves also. You perceive therefore, dearly beloved, that these
   things are not undeserving of vengeance: they are indeed dreadful and
   alien from the doctrine of Christ.

   Wherefore we have assembled together, and have written to you, to
   request of your Christian wisdom to receive this our declaration and
   sympathize with our brother Athanasius, and to shew your indignation
   against Eusebius and his fellows who have essayed such things, in order
   that such malice and wickedness may no longer prevail against the
   Church. We call upon you to be the avengers of such injustice,
   reminding you of the injunction of the Apostle, Put away from among
   yourselves that wicked person [531] .' Wicked indeed is their conduct,
   and unworthy of your communion. Wherefore give no further heed to them,
   though they should again write to you against the Bishop Athanasius
   (for all that proceeds from them is false); not even though they
   subscribe their letter with names [532] of Egyptian Bishops. For it is
   evident that it will not be we who write, but the Meletians [533] , who
   have ever been schismatics, and who even unto this day make
   disturbances and raise factions in the Churches. For they ordain
   improper persons, and all but heathens; and they are guilty of such
   actions as we are ashamed to set down in writing, but which you may
   learn from those whom we have sent unto you, who will also deliver to
   you our letter.

   20. Thus wrote the Bishops of Egypt to all Bishops, and to Julius,
   Bishop of Rome.

   [472] The Council of Sardica says eighty; which is a usual number in
   Egyptian Councils. (vid. Tillemont, vol. 8. p. 74.) There were about
   ninety Bishops in Egypt, the Thebais, and Libya. The present Council
   was held [at the end of 338 or possibly at the beginning of 339]. Its
   synodal Epistle is contained below, Â§3, and is particularly addressed
   to Pope Julius, Â§20.

   [487] The Eusebians alleged that, fifty-four Bishops of the two parties
   of S. Alexander and Meletius being assembled for the election, and
   having sworn to elect by the common voice, six or seven of these broke
   their oaths in favour of S. Athanasius, whom no one had thought of, and
   consecrated him in secret to the great surprise and scandal of both
   ecclesiastical and lay persons. vid. Socr. ii. 17. Philostorgius (a.d.
   425) adds particulars, explanatory or corrective of this statement, of
   which the Bishops in the text do not seem to have heard; viz., that
   Athanasius with his party one night seized on the Church of St.
   Dionysius, and compelled two Bishops whom he found there to consecrate
   him against their will; that he was in consequence anathematized by all
   the other Bishops, but that, fortifying himself in his position, he
   sent in his election to the Emperor, and by this means obtained its
   confirmation. H. E. ii. 16. It appears, in matter of fact, that S.
   Athan. was absent at time of his election; as Socrates says, in order
   to avoid it, or as Epiphanius, on business at the Court; these reasons
   are compatible. [Cf. Prolegg. ch. ii. Â§4, and Gwatkin's note, quoted
   there.]

   [488] It is contested whether S. Athan. was ever one of S. Antony's
   monks, the reading of a passage in the commencement of his Vit. Ant.,
   which would decide the question, varying in different mss. The word
   "ascetic" is used of those who lived a life, as afterwards followed in
   Monasteries, in the Ante-Nicene times. [See D.C.B. 1. 181^a, and
   Prolegg. ch. ii. Â§1 ad fin, and Introd. to Vit. Ant.]

   [489] The Canons of NicÃ¦a and Sardica were absolute against
   translation, but, as Bingham observes, Antiqu. vi. 4. Â§6, only as a
   general rule. The so-called Apostolical Canons except "a reasonable
   cause" and the sanction of a Council; one of the Councils of Carthage
   prohibits them when subserving ambitious views, and except for the
   advantage of the Church. Vid. list of translations in Socr. Hist. vii.

   and was deposed together with him after the Nicene Council for

   exiled by the Emperor, see Prolegg. ch. ii. Â§Â§3 (1) and (2) c, 6 (1).]

   [496] At the Council of Tyre, Potamo, an Egyptian Bishop and Confessor
   asked Eusebius what had happened to him in prison during the
   persecution, Epiph. HÃ¦r. 68, 7, as if hinting at his cowardice. It
   appears that Eusebius was prisoner at CÃ¦sarea with S. Pamphilus; yet he
   never mentions the fact himself, which is unlike him, if it was
   producible. [The insinuation of Potammon was groundless: see Dic. C.
   Biog. ii. 311.]

   [497] George, Bishop of Laodicea, had been degraded when a priest by S.
   Alexander, for his profligate habits as well as his Arianism. Athan.
   speaks of him elsewhere as reprobated even by his party. de Fug. 26.

   [502] The circumstances of this appeal, which are related by Athan.
   below, Â§86, are thus summed up by Gibbon; "Before the final sentence
   could be pronounced at Tyre, the intrepid primate threw himself into a
   bark which was ready to hoist sail for the imperial city. The request
   of a formal audience might have been opposed or eluded; but Athanasius
   concealed his arrival, watched the moment of Constantine's return from
   an adjacent villa, and boldly encountered his angry sovereign as he
   passed on horseback through the principal street of Constantinople. So
   strange an apparition excited his surprise and indignation; and the
   guards were ordered to remove the importunate suitor; but his
   resentment was subdued by involuntary respect; and the haughty spirit
   of the Emperor was awed by the courage and eloquence of a Bishop, who
   implored his justice and awakened his conscience." Decl. and Fall, xxi.
   Athan. was a small man in person.

   [505] This period, when Christianity was acknowledged by the state but
   not embraced by the population, is just the time when we hear most of
   this Reserve as a principle. While Christians were but a sect,
   persecution enforced a discipline, and when they were commensurate with
   the nation, faith made it unnecessary. We are now returned to the state
   of the fourth century.

   Chapter II.--Letter of Julius to the Eusebians at Antioch.

   Eusebius and his fellows wrote also to Julius, and thinking to frighten
   me, requested him to call a council, and to be himself the judge, if he
   so pleased [534] . When therefore I went up to Rome, Julius wrote to
   Eusebius and his fellows as was suitable, and sent moreover two of his
   own Presbyters [535] , Elpidius and Philoxenus [536] . But they, when
   they heard of me, were thrown into confusion, as not expecting my going
   up thither; and they declined the proposed Council, alleging
   unsatisfactory reasons for so doing, but in truth they were afraid lest
   the things should be proved against them which Valens and Ursacius
   afterwards confessed [537] . However, more than fifty Bishops
   assembled, in the place where the Presbyter Vito held his congregation;
   and they acknowledged my defence, and gave me the confirmation [538]
   both of their communion and their love. On the other hand, they
   expressed great indignation against Eusebius and his fellows, and
   requested that Julius would write to the following effect to those of
   their number who had written to him. Which accordingly he did, and sent
   it by the hand of Count Gabianus.

   The Letter of Julius.

   Julius to his dearly beloved brethren [539] , Danius, Flacillus,
   Narcissus, Eusebius, Maris, Macedonius, Theodorus, and their friends,
   who have written to me from Antioch, sends health in the Lord.

   21. I have read your letter [540] which was brought to me by my
   Presbyters Elpidius and Philoxenus, and I am surprised to find that,
   whereas I wrote to you in charity and with conscious sincerity, you
   have replied to me in an unbecoming and contentious temper; for the
   pride and arrogance of the writers is plainly exhibited in that letter.
   Yet such feelings are inconsistent with the Christian faith; for what
   was written in a charitable spirit ought likewise to be answered in a
   spirit of charity and not of contention. And was it not a token of
   charity to send Presbyters to sympathize with them that are in
   suffering, and to desire those who had written to me to come thither,
   that the questions at issue might obtain a speedy settlement, and all
   things be duly ordered, so that our brethren might no longer be exposed
   to suffering, and that you might escape further calumny? But something
   seems to shew that your temper is such, as to force us to conclude that
   even in the terms in which you appeared to pay honour to us, you have
   expressed yourselves under the disguise of irony. The Presbyters also
   whom we sent to you, and who ought to have returned rejoicing, did on
   the contrary return sorrowful on account of the proceedings they had
   witnessed among you. And I, when I had read your letter, after much
   consideration, kept it to myself, thinking that after all some of you
   would come, and there would be no need to bring it forward, lest if it
   should be openly exhibited, it should grieve many of our brethren here.
   But when no one arrived, and it became necessary that the letter should
   be produced, I declare to you, they were all astonished, and were
   hardly able to believe that such a letter had been written by you at
   all; for it is expressed in terms of contention rather than of charity.

   Now if the author of it wrote with an ambition of exhibiting his power
   of language, such a practice surely is more suitable for other
   subjects: in ecclesiastical matters, it is not a display of eloquence
   that is needed, but the observance of Apostolic Canons, and an earnest
   care not to offend one of the little ones of the Church. For it were
   better for a man, according to the word of the Church, that a millstone
   were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the sea, than
   that he should offend even one of the little ones [541] . But if such a
   letter was written, because certain persons have been aggrieved on
   account of their meanness of spirit towards one another (for I will not
   impute it to all); it were better not to entertain any such feeling of
   offence at all, at least not to let the sun go down upon their
   vexation; and certainly not to give it room to exhibit itself in
   writing.

   22. Yet what has been done that is a just cause of vexation? or in what
   respect was my letter to you such? Was it, that I invited you to be
   present at a council? You ought rather to have received the proposal
   with joy. Those who have confidence in their proceedings, or as they
   choose to term them, in their decisions, are not wont to be angry, if
   such decision is inquired into by others; they rather shew all
   boldness, seeing that if they have given a just decision, it can never
   prove to be the reverse. The Bishops who assembled in the great Council
   of NicÃ¦a agreed, not without the will of God, that the decisions of one
   council should be examined in another [542] , to the end that the
   judges, having before their eyes that other trial which was to follow,
   might be led to investigate matters with the utmost caution, and that
   the parties concerned in their sentence might have assurance that the
   judgment they received was just, and not dictated by the enmity of
   their former judges. Now if you are unwilling that such a practice
   should be adopted in your own case, though it is of ancient standing,
   and has been noticed and recommended by the great Council, your refusal
   is not becoming; for it is unreasonable that a custom which had once
   obtained in the Church, and been established by councils, should be set
   aside by a few individuals.

   For a further reason they cannot justly take offence in this point.
   When the persons whom you, Eusebius and his fellows, dispatched with
   your letters, I mean Macarius the Presbyter, and Martyrius and
   Hesychius the Deacons, arrived here, and found that they were unable to
   withstand the arguments of the Presbyters who came from Athanasius, but
   were confuted and exposed on all sides, they then requested me to call
   a Council together, and to write to Alexandria to the Bishop
   Athanasius, and also to Eusebius and his fellows, in order that a just
   judgment might be given in presence of all parties. And they undertook
   in that case to prove all the charges which had been brought against
   Athanasius. For Martyrius and Hesychius had been publicly refuted by
   us, and the Presbyters of the Bishop Athanasius had withstood them with
   great confidence: indeed, if one must tell the truth, Martyrius and his
   fellows had been utterly overthrown; and this it was that led them to
   desire that a Council might be held. Now supposing that they had not
   desired a Council, but that I had been the person to propose it, in
   discouragement of those who had written to me, and for the sake of our
   brethren who complain that they have suffered injustice; even in that
   case the proposal would have been reasonable and just, for it is
   agreeable to ecclesiastical practice, and well pleasing to God. But
   when those persons, whom you, Eusebius and his fellows, considered to
   be trustworthy, when even they wished me to call the brethren together,
   it was inconsistent in the parties invited to take offence, when they
   ought rather to have shewn all readiness to be present. These
   considerations shew that the display of anger in the offended persons
   is petulant, and the refusal of those who decline to meet the Council
   is unbecoming, and has a suspicious appearance. Does any one find
   fault, if he sees that done by another, which he would allow if done by
   himself? If, as you write, each council has an irreversible force, and
   he who has given judgment on a matter is dishonoured, if his sentence
   is examined by others; consider, dearly beloved, who are they that
   dishonour councils? who are setting aside the decisions of former
   judges? Not to inquire at present into every individual case, lest I
   should appear to press too heavily on certain parties, the last
   instance that has occurred, and which every one who hears it must
   shudder at, will be sufficient in proof of the others which I omit.

   23. The Arians who were excommunicated for their impiety by Alexander,
   the late Bishop of Alexandria, of blessed memory, were not only
   proscribed by the brethren in the several cities, but were also
   anathematised by the whole body assembled together in the great Council
   of NicÃ¦a. For theirs was no ordinary offence, neither had they sinned
   against man, but against our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, the Son of the
   living God. And yet these persons who were proscribed by the whole
   world, and branded in every Church, are said now to have been admitted
   to communion again; which I think even you ought to hear with
   indignation. Who then are the parties who dishonour a council? Are not
   they who have set at nought the votes of the Three hundred [543] , and
   have preferred impiety to godliness? The heresy of the Arian madmen was
   condemned and proscribed by the whole body of Bishops everywhere; but
   the Bishops Athanasius and Marcellus have many supporters who speak and
   write in their behalf. We have received testimony in favour of
   Marcellus [544] , that he resisted the advocates of the Arian doctrines
   in the Council of NicÃ¦a; and in favour of Athanasius [545] , that at
   Tyre nothing was brought home to him, and that in the Mareotis, where
   the Reports against him are said to have been drawn up, he was not
   present. Now you know, dearly beloved, that ex parte proceedings are of
   no weight, but bear a suspicious appearance. Nevertheless, these things
   being so, we, in order to be accurate, and neither shewing any
   prepossession in favour of yourselves, nor of those who wrote in behalf
   of the other party, invited those who had written to us to come hither;
   that, since there were many who wrote in their behalf, all things might
   be enquired into in a council, and neither the guiltless might be
   condemned, nor the person on his trial be accounted innocent. We then
   are not the parties who dishonour a council, but they who at once and
   recklessly have received the Arians whom all had condemned, and
   contrary to the decision of the judges. The greater part of those
   judges have now departed, and are with Christ; but some of them are
   still in this life of trial, and are indignant at learning that certain
   persons have set aside their judgment.

   24. We have also been informed of the following circumstance by those
   who were at Alexandria. A certain Carpones, who had been excommunicated
   by Alexander for Arianism, was sent hither by one Gregory with certain
   others, also excommunicated for the same heresy. However, I had learnt
   the matter also from the Presbyter Macarius, and the Deacons Martyrius
   and Hesychius. For before the Presbyters of Athanasius arrived they
   urged me to send letters to one Pistus at Alexandria, though at the
   same time the Bishop Athanasius was there. And when the Presbyters of
   the Bishop Athanasius came, they informed me that this Pistus was an
   Arian, and that he had been excommunicated [546] by the Bishop
   Alexander and the Council of NicÃ¦a, and then ordained [547] by one
   Secundus, whom also the great Council excommunicated as an Arian. This
   statement Martyrius and his fellows did not gainsay, nor did they deny
   that Pistus had received his ordination from Secundus. Now consider,
   after this who are most justly liable to blame? I, who could not be
   prevailed upon to write to the Arian Pistus; or those, who advised me
   to do dishonour to the great Council, and to address the irreligious as
   if they were religious persons? Moreover, when the Presbyter Macarius,
   who had been sent hither by Eusebius with Martyrius and the rest, heard
   of the opposition which had been made by the Presbyters of Athanasius,
   while we were expecting his appearance with Martyrius and Hesychius, he
   departed in the night, in spite of a bodily ailment; which leads us to
   conjecture that his departure arose from shame on account of the
   exposure which had been made concerning Pistus. For it is impossible
   that the ordination of the Arian Secundus should be considered valid in
   the Catholic Church. This would indeed be dishonour to the Council, and
   to the Bishops who composed it, if the decrees they framed, as in the
   presence of God, with such extreme earnestness and care, should be set
   aside as worthless.

   25. If, as you write [548] , the decrees of all Councils ought to be of
   force, according to the precedent in the case of Novatus [549] and Paul
   of Samosata, all the more ought not the sentence of the Three hundred
   to be reversed, certainly a general Council ought not to be set at
   nought by a few individuals. For the Arians are heretics as they, and
   the like sentence has been passed both against one and the other. And,
   after such bold proceedings as these, who are they that have lighted up
   the flame of discord? for in your letter you blame us for having done
   this. Is it we, who have sympathised with the sufferings of the
   brethren, and have acted in all respects according to the Canon; or
   they who contentiously and contrary to the Canon have set aside the
   sentence of the Three hundred, and dishonoured the Council in every
   way? For not only have the Arians been received into communion, but
   Bishops also have made a practice of removing from one place to another
   [550] . Now if you really believe that all Bishops have the same and
   equal authority [551] , and you do not, as you assert, account of them
   according to the magnitude of their cities; he that is entrusted with a
   small city ought to abide in the place committed to him, and not from
   disdain of his trust to remove to one that has never been put under
   him; despising that which God has given him, and making much of the
   vain applause of men. You ought then, dearly beloved, to have come and
   not declined, that the matter may be brought to a conclusion; for this
   is what reason demands.

   But perhaps you were prevented by the time fixed upon for the Council,
   for you complain in your letter that the interval before the day we
   appointed [552] was too short. But this, beloved, is a mere excuse. Had
   the day forestalled any when on the journey, the interval allowed would
   then have been proved to be too short. But when persons do not wish to
   come, and detain even my Presbyters up to the month of January [553] ,
   it is the mere excuse of those who have no confidence in their cause;
   otherwise, as I said before, they would have come, not regarding the
   length of the journey, not considering the shortness of the time, but
   trusting to the justice and reasonableness of their cause. But perhaps
   they did not come on account of the aspect of the times [554] , for
   again you declare in your letter, that we ought to have considered the
   present circumstances of the East, and not to have urged you to come.
   Now if as you say you did not come because the times were such, you
   ought to have considered such times beforehand, and not to have become
   the authors of schism, and of mourning and lamentation in the Churches.
   But as the matter stands, men, who have been the cause of these things,
   shew that it is not the times that are to blame, but the determination
   of those who will not meet a Council.

   26. But I wonder also how you could ever have written that part of your
   letter, in which you say, that I alone wrote, and not to all of you,
   but to Eusebius and his fellows only. In this complaint one may
   discover more of readiness to find fault than of regard for truth. I
   received the letters against Athanasius from none other than Martyrius,
   Hesychius and their fellows, and I necessarily wrote to them who had
   written against him. Either then Eusebius and his fellows ought not
   alone to have written, apart from you all, or else you, to whom I did
   not write, ought not to be offended that I wrote to them who had
   written to me. If it was right that I should address my letter to you
   all, you also ought to have written with them: but now considering what
   was reasonable, I wrote to them, who had addressed themselves to me,
   and had given me information. But if you were displeased because I
   alone wrote to them, it is but consistent that you should also be
   angry, because they wrote to me alone. But for this also, beloved,
   there was a fair and not unreasonable cause. Nevertheless it is
   necessary that I should acquaint you that, although I wrote, yet the
   sentiments I expressed were not those of myself alone, but of all the
   Bishops throughout Italy and in these parts. I indeed was unwilling to
   cause them all to write, lest the others should be overpowered by their
   number. The Bishops however assembled on the appointed day, and agreed
   in these opinions, which I again write to signify to you; so that,
   dearly beloved, although I alone address you, yet you may be assured
   that these are the sentiments of all. Thus much for the excuses, not
   reasonable, but unjust and suspicious, which some of you have alleged
   for your conduct.

   27. Now although what has already been said were sufficient to shew
   that we have not admitted to our communion our brothers Athanasius and
   Marcellus either too readily, or unjustly, yet it is but fair briefly
   to set the matter before you. Eusebius and his fellows wrote formerly
   against Athanasius and his fellows, as you also have written now; but a
   great number of Bishops out of Egypt and other provinces wrote in his
   favour. Now in the first place, your letters against him are
   inconsistent with one another, and the second have no sort of agreement
   with the first, but in many instances the former are answered by the
   latter, and the latter are impeached by the former. Now where there is
   this contradiction in letters, no credit whatever is due to the
   statements they contain. In the next place if you require us to believe
   what you have written, it is but consistent that we should not refuse
   credit to those who have written in his favour; especially, considering
   that you write from a distance, while they are on the spot, are
   acquainted with the man, and the events which are occurring there, and
   testify in writing to his manner of life, and positively affirm that he
   has been the victim of a conspiracy throughout.

   Again, a certain Bishop Arsenius was said at one time to have been made
   away with by Athanasius, but we have learned that he is alive, nay,
   that he is on terms of friendship with him. He has positively asserted
   that the Reports drawn up in the Mareotis were ex parte ones; for that
   neither the Presbyter Macarius, the accused party, was present, nor yet
   his Bishop, Athanasius himself. This we have learnt, not only from his
   own mouth, but also from the Reports which Martyrius, Hesychius and
   their fellows, brought to us [555] ; for we found on reading them, that
   the accuser Ischyras was present there, but neither Macarius, nor the
   Bishop Athanasius; and that the Presbyters of Athanasius desired to
   attend, but were not permitted. Now, beloved, if the trial was to be
   conducted honestly, not only the accuser, but the accused also ought to
   have been present. As the accused party Macarius attended at Tyre, as
   well as the accuser Ischyras, when nothing was proved, so not only
   ought the accuser to have gone to the Mareotis, but also the accused,
   so that in person he might either be convicted, or by not being
   convicted might shew the falseness of the accusation. But now, as this
   was not the case, but the accuser only went out thither, with those to
   whom Athanasius objected, the proceedings wear a suspicious appearance.

   28. And he complained also that the persons who went to the Mareotis
   went against his wish, for that Theognius, Maris, Theodorus, Ursacius,
   Valens, and Macedonius, who were the persons they sent out, were of
   suspected character. This he shewed not by his own assertions merely,
   but from the letter of Alexander who was Bishop of Thessalonica; for he
   produced a letter written by him to Dionysius [556] , the Count who
   presided in the Council, in which he shews most clearly that there was
   a conspiracy on foot against Athanasius. He has also brought forward a
   genuine document, all in the handwriting of the accuser Ischyras
   himself [557] , in which he calls God Almighty to witness that no cup
   was broken, nor table overthrown, but that he had been suborned by
   certain persons to invent these accusations. Moreover, when the
   Presbyters of the Mareotis arrived [558] , they positively affirmed
   that Ischyras was not a Presbyter of the Catholic Church and that
   Macarius had not committed any such offence as the other had laid to
   his charge. The Presbyters and Deacons also who came to us testified in
   the fullest manner in favour of the Bishop Athanasius, strenuously
   asserting that none of those things which were alleged against him were
   true, but that he was the victim of a conspiracy.

   And all the Bishops of Egypt and Libya wrote and protested [559] that
   his ordination was lawful and strictly ecclesiastical, and that all
   that you had advanced against him was false, for that no murder had
   been committed, nor any persons despatched on his account, nor any cup
   broken, but that all was false. Nay, the Bishop Athanasius also shewed
   from the ex parte reports drawn up in the Mareotis, that a catechumen
   was examined and said [560] , that he was within with Ischyras, at the
   time when they say Macarius the Presbyter of Athanasius burst into the
   place; and that others who were examined said,--one, that Ischyras was
   in a small cell,--and another, that he was lying down behind the door,
   being sick at that very time, when they say Macarius came thither. Now
   from these representations of his, we are naturally led to ask the
   question, How was it possible that a man who was lying behind the door
   sick could get up, conduct the service, and offer? and how could it be
   that Oblations were offered when catechumens were within [561] ? for if
   there were catechumens present, it was not yet the time for presenting
   the Oblations. These representations, as I said, were made by the
   Bishop Athanasius, and he showed from the reports, what was also
   positively affirmed by those who were with him, that Ischyras has never
   been a presbyter at all in the Catholic Church, nor has ever appeared
   as a presbyter in the assemblies of the Church; for not even when
   Alexander admitted those of the Meletian schism, by the indulgence of
   the great Council, was he named by Meletius among his presbyters, as
   they deposed [562] ; which is the strongest argument possible that he
   was not even a presbyter of Meletius; for otherwise, he would certainly
   have been numbered with the rest. Besides, it was shewn also by
   Athanasius from the reports, that Ischyras had spoken falsely in other
   instances: for he set up a charge respecting the burning of certain
   books, when, as they pretend, Macarius burst in upon them, but was
   convicted of falsehood by the witnesses he himself brought to prove it.

   29. Now when these things were thus represented to us, and so many
   witnesses appeared in his favour, and so much was advanced by him in
   his own justification, what did it become us to do? what did the rule
   of the Church require of us, but that we should not condemn him, but
   rather receive him and treat him like a Bishop, as we have done?
   Moreover, besides all this he continued here a year and six months
   [563] , expecting the arrival of yourselves and of whoever chose to
   come, and by his presence he put everyone to shame, for he would not
   have been here, had he not felt confident in his cause; and he came not
   of his own accord, but on an invitation by letter from us, in the
   manner in which we wrote to you [564] . But still you complain after
   all of our transgressing the Canons. Now consider; who are they that
   have so acted? we who received this man with such ample proof of his
   innocence, or they who, being at Antioch at the distance of six and
   thirty posts [565] , nominated a stranger to be Bishop, and sent him to
   Alexandria with a military force; a thing which was not done even when
   Athanasius was banished into Gaul, though it would have been done then,
   had he been really proved guilty of the offence. But when he returned,
   of course he found his Church unoccupied and waiting for him.

   30. But now I am ignorant under what colour these proceedings have been
   carried on. In the first place, if the truth must be spoken, it was not
   right, when we had written to summon a council, that any persons should
   anticipate its decisions: and in the next place, it was not fitting
   that such novel proceedings should be adopted against the Church. For
   what canon of the Church, or what Apostolical tradition warrants this,
   that when a Church was at peace, and so many Bishops were in unanimity
   with Athanasius the Bishop of Alexandria, Gregory should be sent
   thither, a stranger to the city, not having been baptized there, nor
   known to the general body, and desired neither by Presbyters, nor
   Bishops, nor Laity--that he should be appointed at Antioch, and sent to
   Alexandria, accompanied not by presbyters, nor by deacons of the city,
   nor by bishops of Egypt, but by soldiers? for they who came hither
   complained that this was the case.

   Even supposing that Athanasius was in the position of a criminal after
   the Council, this appointment ought not to have been made thus
   illegally and contrary to the rule of the Church, but the Bishops of
   the province ought to have ordained one in that very Church, of that
   very Priesthood, of that very Clergy [566] ; and the Canons received
   from the Apostles ought not thus to be set aside. Had this offence been
   committed against any one of you, would you not have exclaimed against
   it, and demanded justice as for the transgression of the Canons? Dearly
   beloved, we speak honestly, as in the presence of God, and declare,
   that this proceeding was neither pious, nor lawful, nor ecclesiastical.
   Moreover, the account which is given of the conduct of Gregory on his
   entry into the city, plainly shews the character of his appointment. In
   such peaceful times, as those who came from Alexandria declared them to
   have been, and as the Bishops also represented in their letters, the
   Church was set on fire; Virgins were stripped; Monks were trodden under
   foot; Presbyters and many of the people were scourged and suffered
   violence; Bishops were cast into prison; multitudes were dragged about
   from place to place; the holy Mysteries [567] , about which they
   accused the Presbyter Macarius, were seized upon by heathens and cast
   upon the ground; and all to constrain certain persons to admit the
   appointment of Gregory. Such conduct plainly shews who they are that
   transgress the Canons. Had the appointment been lawful, he would not
   have had recourse to illegal proceedings to compel the obedience of
   those who in a legal way resisted him. And notwithstanding all this,
   you write that perfect peace prevailed in Alexandria and Egypt. Surely
   not, unless the work of peace is entirely changed, and you call such
   doings as these peace.

   31. I have also thought it necessary to point out to you this
   circumstance, viz. that Athanasius positively asserted that Macarius
   was kept at Tyre under a guard of soldiers, while only his accuser
   accompanied those who went to the Mareotis; and that the Presbyters who
   desired to attend the inquiry were not permitted to do so, while the
   said inquiry respecting the cup and the Table was carried on before the
   Prefect and his band, and in the presence of Heathens and Jews. This at
   first seemed incredible, but it was proved to have been so from the
   Reports; which caused great astonishment to us, as I suppose, dearly
   beloved, it does to you also. Presbyters, who are the ministers of the
   Mysteries, are not permitted to attend, but an enquiry concerning
   Christ's Blood and Christ's Body is carried on before an external
   judge, in the presence of Catechumens, nay, worse than that, before
   Heathens and Jews, who are in ill repute in regard to Christianity.
   Even supposing that an offense had been committed, it should have been
   investigated legally in the Church and by the Clergy, not by heathens
   who abhor the Word and know not the Truth. I am persuaded that both you
   and all men must perceive the nature and magnitude of this sin. Thus
   much concerning Athanasius.

   32. With respect to Marcellus [568] , forasmuch as you have charged him
   also of impiety towards Christ, I am anxious to inform you, that when
   he was here, he positively declared that what you had written
   concerning him was not true; but being nevertheless requested by us to
   give an account of his faith, he answered in his own person with the
   utmost boldness, so that we recognised that he maintains nothing
   outside the truth. He made a confession [569] of the same godly
   doctrines concerning our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ as the Catholic
   Church confesses; and he affirmed that he had held these opinions for a
   very long time, and had not recently adopted them: as indeed our
   Presbyters [570] , who were at a former date present at the Council of
   NicÃ¦a, testified to his orthodoxy; for he maintained then, as he has
   done now, his opposition to Arianism (on which points it is right to
   admonish you, lest any of you admit such heresy, instead of abominating
   it as alien from sound doctrine [571] ). Seeing then that he professed
   orthodox opinions, and had testimony to his orthodoxy, what, I ask
   again in his case, ought we to have done, except to receive him as a
   Bishop, as we did, and not reject him from our communion? These things
   I have written, not so much for the purpose of defending their cause,
   as in order to convince you, that we acted justly and canonically in
   receiving these persons, and that you are contentious without a cause.
   But it is your duty to use your anxious endeavours and to labour by
   every means to correct the irregularities which have been committed
   contrary to the Canon, and to secure the peace of the Churches; so that
   the peace of our Lord which has been given to us [572] may remain, and
   the Churches may not be divided, nor you incur the charge of being
   authors of schism. For I confess, your past conduct is an occasion of
   schism rather than of peace.

   33. For not only the Bishops Athanasius and Marcellus and their fellows
   came hither and complained of the injustice that had been done them,
   but many other Bishops also [573] , from Thrace, from Coele-Syria, from
   Phoenicia and Palestine, and Presbyters, not a few, and others from
   Alexandria and from other parts, were present at the Council here, and
   in addition to their other statements, lamented before all the
   assembled Bishops the violence and injustice which the Churches had
   suffered, and affirmed that similar outrages to those which had been
   committed in Alexandria had occurred in their own Churches, and in
   others also. Again there lately came Presbyters with letters from Egypt
   and Alexandria, who complained that many Bishops and Presbyters who
   wished to come to the Council were prevented; for they said that, since
   the departure of Athanasius [574] even up to this time, Bishops who are
   confessors [575] have been beaten with stripes, that others have been
   cast into prison, and that but lately aged men, who have been an
   exceedingly long period in the Episcopate, have been given up to be
   employed in the public works, and nearly all the Clergy of the Catholic
   Church with the people are the objects of plots and persecutions.
   Moreover they said that certain Bishops and other brethren had been
   banished for no other reason than to compel them against their will to
   communicate with Gregory and his Arian associates. We have heard also
   from others, what is confirmed by the testimony of the Bishop
   Marcellus, that a number of outrages, similar to those which were
   committed at Alexandria, have occurred also at Ancyra in Galatia [576]
   . And in addition to all this, those who came to the Council reported
   against some of you (for I will not mention names) certain charges of
   so dreadful a nature that I have declined setting them down in writing:
   perhaps you also have heard them from others. It was for this cause
   especially that I wrote to desire you to come, that you might be
   present to hear them, and that all irregularities might be corrected
   and differences healed. And those who were called for these purposes
   ought not to have refused, but to have come the more readily, lest by
   failing to do so they should be suspected of what was alleged against
   them, and be thought unable to prove what they had written.

   34. Now according to these representations, since the Churches are thus
   afflicted and treacherously assaulted, as our informants positively
   affirmed, who are they that have lighted up a flame of discord [577] ?
   We, who grieve for such a state of things and sympathize with the
   sufferings of the brethren, or they who have brought these things
   about? While then such extreme confusion existed in every Church, which
   was the cause why those who visited us came hither, I wonder how you
   could write that unanimity prevailed in the Churches. These things tend
   not to the edification of the Church, but to her destruction; and those
   who rejoice in them are not sons of peace, but of confusion: but our
   God is not a God of confusion, but of peace [578] . Wherefore, as the
   God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ knows, it was from a regard for
   your good name, and with prayers that the Churches might not fall into
   confusion, but might continue as they were regulated by the Apostles,
   that I thought it necessary to write thus unto you, to the end that you
   might at length put to shame those who through the effects of their
   mutual enmity have brought the Churches to this condition. For I have
   heard, that it is only a certain few [579] who are the authors of all
   these things.

   Now, as having bowels of mercy, take ye care to correct, as I said
   before, the irregularities which have been committed contrary to the
   Canon, so that if any mischief has already befallen, it may be healed
   through your zeal. And write not that I have preferred the communion of
   Marcellus and Athanasius to yours, for such like complaints are no
   indications of peace, but of contentiousness and hatred of the
   brethren. For this cause I have written the foregoing, that you may
   understand that we acted not unjustly in admitting them to our
   communion, and so may cease this strife. If you had come hither, and
   they had been condemned, and had appeared unable to produce reasonable
   evidence in support of their cause, you would have done well in writing
   thus. But seeing that, as I said before, we acted agreeably to the
   Canon, and not unjustly, in holding communion with them, I beseech you
   for the sake of Christ, suffer not the members of Christ to be torn
   asunder, neither trust to prejudices, but seek rather the peace of the
   Lord. It is neither holy nor just, in order to gratify the petty
   feeling of a few persons, to reject those who have never been condemned
   and thereby to grieve the Spirit [580] . But if you think that you are
   able to prove anything against them, and to confute them face to face
   let those of you who please come hither: for they also promised that
   they would be ready to establish completely the truth of those things
   which they have reported to us.

   35. Give us notice therefore of this, dearly beloved, that we may write
   both to them, and to the Bishops who will have again to assemble, so
   that the accused may be condemned in the presence of all, and confusion
   no longer prevail in the Churches. What has already taken place is
   enough: it is enough surely that Bishops have been sentenced to
   banishment in the presence of Bishops; of which it behoves me not to
   speak at length, lest I appear to press too heavily on those who were
   present on those occasions. But if one must speak the truth, matters
   ought not to have proceeded so far; their petty feeling ought not to
   have been suffered to reach the present pitch. Let us grant the
   "removal," as you write, of Athanasius and Marcellus, from their own
   places, yet what must one say of the case of the other Bishops and
   Presbyters who, as I said before, came hither from various parts, and
   who complained that they also had been forced away, and had suffered
   the like injuries? O beloved, the decisions of the Church are no longer
   according to the Gospel, but tend only to banishment and death [581] .
   Supposing, as you assert, that some offence rested upon those persons,
   the case ought to have been conducted against them, not after this
   manner, but according to the Canon of the Church. Word should have been
   written of it to us all [582] , that so a just sentence might proceed
   from all. For the sufferers were Bishops, and Churches of no ordinary
   note, but those which the Apostles themselves had governed in their own
   persons [583] .

   And why was nothing said to us concerning the Church of the
   Alexandrians in particular? Are you ignorant that the custom has been
   for word to be written first to us, and then for a just decision to be
   passed from this place [584] ? If then any such suspicion rested upon
   the Bishop there, notice thereof ought to have been sent to the Church
   of this place; whereas, after neglecting to inform us, and proceeding
   on their own authority as they pleased, now they desire to obtain our
   concurrence in their decisions, though we never condemned him. Not so
   have the constitutions [585] of Paul, not so have the traditions of the
   Fathers directed; this is another form of procedure, a novel practice.
   I beseech you, readily bear with me: what I write is for the common
   good. For what we have received from the blessed Apostle Peter [586] ,
   that I signify to you; and I should not have written this, as deeming
   that these things were manifest unto all men, had not these proceedings
   so disturbed us. Bishops are forced away from their sees and driven
   into banishment, while others from different quarters are appointed in
   their place; others are treacherously assailed, so that the people have
   to grieve for those who are forcibly taken from them, while, as to
   those who are sent in their room, they are obliged to give over seeking
   the man whom they desire, and to receive those they do not.

   I ask of you, that such things may no longer be, but that you will
   denounce in writing those persons who attempt them; so that the
   Churches may no longer be afflicted thus, nor any Bishop or Presbyter
   be treated with insult, nor any one be compelled to act contrary to his
   judgment, as they have represented to us, lest we become a
   laughing-stock among the heathen, and above all, lest we excite the
   wrath of God against us. For every one of us shall give account in the
   Day of judgment [587] of the things which he has done in this life. May
   we all be possessed with the mind of God! so that the Churches may
   recover their own Bishops, and rejoice evermore in Jesus Christ our
   Lord; through Whom to the Father be glory, for ever and ever. Amen.

   I pray for your health in the Lord, brethren dearly beloved and greatly
   longed for.

   36. Thus wrote the Council of Rome by Julius, Bishop of Rome.

   without any right of initiative, in Can. 3; Can. 5 simply regulates the

   [539] By Danius, which had been considered the same name as Dianius,
   Bishop of CÃ¦sarea in Cappadocia, Montfaucon in loc. understands the
   notorious Arian Bishop of NicÃ¦a, called variously Diognius (supr.
   Â§13.), Theognius (infr Â§28.), Theognis (Philost. Hist. ii. 7.),
   Theogonius, (Theod. Hist. i. 19.), and assigns some ingenious and
   probable reasons for his supposition. [Danius' was the Bishop of
   CÃ¦sarea in Cappad., he also signs at Philippopolis. See D.C.B. under
   Dianius and Basil.] Flacillus, Arian Bishop of Antioch, as Athan. names
   him, is called Placillus (in S. Jerome's Chronicon, p. 785.), Placitus
   (Soz. iii. 5.), Flacitus (Theod. Hist. i. 21.). Theodorus was Arian
   Bishop of Heraclea, whose Comments on the Psalms are supposed to be
   those which bear his name in Corderius's Catena. [He was not a thorough
   Arian.]

   [540] Some of the topics contained in the Eusebian Letter are specified
   in Julius's answer. It acknowledged, besides, the high dignity of the
   [church] of Rome, as being a "School (phrontisterion) of Apostles and a
   Metropolis of orthodoxy from the beginning," but added that "doctors
   came to it from the east; and they ought not themselves to hold the
   second place, for they were superior in virtue, though not in their
   Church." And they said that they would hold communion with Julius if he
   would agree to their depositions and substitutions in the Eastern Sees.

   [542] As this determination does not find a place among the now

   great moment in the argument in favour of the twenty Canons extant in
   Greek being but a portion of those passed at NicÃ¦a. vid. Alber.
   Dissert. in Hist. Eccles. vii. Abraham Ecchellensis has argued on the
   same side (apud Colet. Concil. t. ii. p. 399. Ed. Ven. 1728), also
   Baronius, though not so strongly, Ann. 325. nn. 157 &c. and Montfaucon
   in loc. Natalis Alexander, SÃ¦c. 4. Dissert. 28 argues against the
   larger number, and Tillemont, Mem. vi. 674. [But it is far more likely

   [584] Socrates says somewhat differently, "Julius wrote back....that

   Council, the Ecclesiastical Canon commanding that the Churches ought
   not to make Canons beside the will of the Bishop of Rome." Hist. ii.

   invalid whatever was transacted beside the will of the Bishop of the
   Romans." Hist. iii. 10. vid. Pope Damasus ap. Theod. Hist. v. 10. Leon.
   Epist. 14. &c. In the passage in the text the prerogative of the Roman
   see is limited, as Coustant observes, to the instance of Alexandria;
   and we actually find in the third century a complaint lodged against
   its Bishop Dionysius with the Pope. [Prolegg. ch. iv. Â§4.]

   Apostles, as a collection of regulation and usages, which more or less
   represented, or claimed to represent, what may be called St. Paul's

   Chapter III.--Letters of the Council of Sardica to the Churches of
   Egypt and of Alexandria, and to all Churches.

   But when, notwithstanding, Eusebius and his fellows proceeded without
   shame, disturbing the Churches, and plotting the ruin of many, the most
   religious Emperors Constantius and Constans being informed of this,
   commanded the Bishops from both the West and East to meet together in
   the city of Sardica. In the meantime Eusebius [588] died: but a great
   number assembled from all parts, and we challenged the associates of
   Eusebius and his fellows to submit to a trial. But they, having before
   their eyes the things that they had done, and perceiving that their
   accusers had come up to the Council, were afraid to do this; but, while
   all besides met with honest intentions, they again brought with them
   the Counts [589] Musonianus [590] and Hesychius the Castrensian [591] ,
   that, as their custom was, they might effect their own aims by their
   authority. But when the Council met without Counts, and no soldiers
   were permitted to be present, they were confounded, and
   conscience-stricken, because they could no longer obtain the judgment
   they wished, but such only as reason and truth required. We, however,
   frequently repeated our challenge, and the Council of Bishops called
   upon them to come forward, saying, "You have come for the purpose of
   undergoing a trial; why then do you now withdraw yourselves? Either you
   ought not to have come, or having come, not to conceal yourselves. Such
   conduct will prove your greatest condemnation. Behold, Athanasius and
   his fellows are here, whom you accused while absent; if therefore you
   think that you have any thing against them, you may convict them face
   to face. But if you pretend to be unwilling to do so, while in truth
   you are unable, you plainly shew yourselves to be calumniators, and
   this is the decision the Council will give you." When they heard this
   they were self-condemned (for they were conscious of their machinations
   and fabrications against us), and were ashamed to appear, thereby
   proving themselves to have been guilty of many base calumnies.

   The holy Council therefore denounced their indecent and suspicious
   flight [592] , and admitted us to make our defence; and when we had
   related their conduct towards us, and proved the truth of our
   statements by witnesses and other evidence, they were filled with
   astonishment, and all acknowledged that our opponents had good reason
   to be afraid to meet the Council, lest their guilt should be proved
   before their faces. They said also, that probably they had come from
   the East, supposing that Athanasius and his fellows would not appear,
   but that, when they saw them confident in their cause, and challenging
   a trial, they fled. They accordingly received us as injured persons who
   had been falsely accused, and confirmed yet more towards us their
   fellowship and love. But they deposed Eusebius's associates in
   wickedness, who had become even more shameless than himself, viz.,
   Theodorus [593] of Heraclea, Narcissus of Neronias, Acacius [594] of
   CÃ¦sarea, Stephanus [595] of Antioch, Ursacius and Valens of Pannonia,
   Menophantus of Ephesus, and George [596] of Laodicaea; and they wrote
   to the Bishops in all parts of the world, and to the diocese of each of
   the injured persons, in the following terms.

   Letter of the Council of Sardica to the Church of Alexandria.

   The Holy Council, by the grace of God assembled at Sardica, from [597]
   Rome, Spain, Gaul, Italy, Campania, Calabria, Apulia, Africa, Sardinia,
   Pannonia, Moesia, Dacia, Noricum, Siscia, Dardania, the other Dacia,
   Macedonia, Thessaly, Achaia, Epirus, Thrace, Rhodope, Palestine,
   Arabia, Crete, and Egypt, to their beloved brothers, the Presbyters and
   Deacons, and to all the Holy Church of God abiding at Alexandria, sends
   health in the Lord.

   37. We were not ignorant, but the fact was well known to us, even
   before we received the letters of your piety, that the supporters of
   the abominated heresy of the Arians were practising many dangerous
   machinations, rather to the destruction of their own souls, than to the
   injury of the Church. For this has ever been the object of their
   unprincipled craft; this is the deadly design in which they have been
   continually engaged; viz. how they may best expel from their places and
   persecute all who are to be found anywhere of orthodox sentiments, and
   maintaining the doctrine of the Catholic Church, which was delivered to
   them from the Fathers. Against some they have laid false accusations;
   others they have driven into banishment; others they have destroyed by
   the punishments inflicted on them. At any rate they endeavoured by
   violence and tyranny to surprise the innocence of our brother and
   fellow-Bishop Athanasius, and therefore conducted their enquiry into
   his case without any care, without any faith, without any sort of
   justice. Accordingly having no confidence in the part they had played
   on that occasion, nor yet in the reports they had circulated against
   him, but perceiving that they were unable to produce any certain
   evidence respecting the case, when they came to the city of Sardica,
   they were unwilling to meet the Council of all the holy Bishops. From
   this it became evident that the decision of our brother and
   fellow-Bishop Julius was a just one [598] ; for after cautious
   deliberation and care he had determined, that we ought not to hesitate
   at all about communion with our brother Athanasius. For he had the
   credible testimony of eighty Bishops, and was also able to advance this
   fair argument in his support that by the mere means of our dearly
   beloved brethren his own Presbyters, and by correspondence, he had
   defeated the design of Eusebius and his fellows, who relied more upon
   violence than upon a judicial enquiry.

   Wherefore all the Bishops from all parts determined upon holding
   communion with Athanasius on the ground that he was innocent. And let
   your charity also observe, that when he came to the holy Council
   assembled at Sardica, the Bishops of the East were informed of the
   circumstance, as we said before, both by letter, and by injunctions
   conveyed by word of mouth, and were invited by us to be present. But,
   being condemned by their own conscience, they had recourse to
   unbecoming excuses, and set themselves to avoid the enquiry. They
   demanded that an innocent man should be rejected from our communion, as
   a culprit, not considering how unbecoming, or rather how impossible,
   such a proceeding was. And as for the Reports which were framed in the
   Mareotis by certain most wicked and most abandoned youths [599] , to
   whose hands one would not commit the very lowest office of the
   ministry, it is certain that they were ex parte statements. For neither
   was our brother the Bishop Athanasius present on the occasion, nor the
   Presbyter Macarius who was accused by them. And besides, their enquiry,
   or rather their falsification of facts, was attended by the most
   disgraceful circumstances. Sometimes heathens, sometimes Catechumens,
   were examined, not that they might declare what they knew, but that
   they might assert those falsehoods which they had been taught by
   others. And when you Presbyters, who were in charge in the absence of
   your Bishop, desired to be present at the enquiry, in order that you
   might shew the truth, and disprove the falsehoods, no regard was paid
   to you; they would not permit you to be present, but drove you away
   with insult.

   Now although their calumnies have been most plainly exposed before all
   men by these circumstances; yet we found also, on reading the Reports,
   that the most iniquitous Ischyras, who has obtained from them the empty
   title of Bishop as his reward for the false accusation, had convicted
   himself of calumny. He declares in the Reports that at the very time
   when, according to his positive assertions, Macarius entered his cell,
   he lay there sick; whereas Eusebius and his fellows had the boldness to
   write that Ischyras was standing up and offering when Macarius came in.

   38. The base and slanderous charge which they next alleged against him,
   has become well-known to all men. They raised a great outcry, affirming
   that Athanasius had committed murder, and had made away with one
   Arsenius a Meletian Bishop, whose loss they pretended to deplore with
   feigned lamentations and fictitious tears, and demanded that the body
   of a living man, as if a dead one, should be given up to them. But
   their fraud was not undetected; one and all knew that the person was
   alive, and was numbered among the living. And when these men, who are
   ready upon any opportunity, perceived their falsehoods detected (for
   Arsenius shewed himself alive, and so proved that he had not been made
   away with, and was not dead), yet they would not rest, but proceeded to
   add other to their former calumnies [600] , and to slander the man by a
   fresh expedient. Well; our brother Athanasius, dearly beloved, was not
   confounded, but again in the present case also with great boldness
   challenged them to the proof, and we too prayed and exhorted them to
   come to the trial, and if they were able, to establish their charge
   against him. O great arrogance! O dreadful pride! or rather, if one
   must say the truth, O evil and accusing conscience! for this is the
   view which all men take of it.

   Wherefore, beloved brethren, we admonish and exhort you, above all
   things to maintain the right faith of the Catholic Church. You have
   undergone many severe and grievous trials; many are the insults and
   injuries which the Catholic Church has suffered, but he that endureth
   to the end, the same shall be saved [601] .' Wherefore even though they
   still recklessly assail you, let your tribulation be unto you for joy.
   For such afflictions are a sort of martyrdom, and such confessions and
   tortures as yours will not be without their reward, but ye shall
   receive the prize from God. Therefore strive above all things in
   support of the sound faith, and of the innocence of your Bishop and our
   fellow-minister Athanasius. We also have not held our peace, nor been
   negligent of what concerns your comfort, but have deliberated and done
   whatsoever the claims of charity demand. We sympathize with our
   suffering brethren, and their affliction we consider as our own.

   39. Accordingly we have written to beseech our most religious and godly
   Emperors, that their kindness would give orders for the release of
   those who are still suffering from affliction and oppression, and would
   command that none of the magistrates, whose duty it is to attend only
   to civil causes, give judgment upon Clergy [602] , nor henceforward in
   any way, on pretence of providing for the Churches, attempt anything
   against the brethren; but that every one may live, as he prays and
   desires to do, free from persecution, from violence and fraud, and in
   quietness and peace may follow the Catholic and Apostolic Faith. As for
   Gregory, who has the reputation of being illegally appointed by the
   heretics, and has been sent by them to your city, we wish your
   unanimity to understand, that he has been deposed by a judgment of the
   whole sacred Council, although indeed he has never at any time been
   considered to be a Bishop at all. Wherefore receive gladly your Bishop
   Athanasius, for to this end we have dismissed him in peace. And we
   exhort all those who either through fear, or through the intrigues of
   certain persons, have held communion with Gregory, that now being
   admonished, exhorted, and persuaded by us, they withdraw from that his
   detestable communion, and straightway unite themselves to the Catholic
   Church.

   40. But forasmuch as we have learnt that Aphthonius, Athanasius the son
   of Capito, Paul, and Plutio, our fellow Presbyters [603] , have also
   suffered from the machinations of Eusebius and his fellows, so that
   some of them have had trial of exile, and others have fled on peril of
   their lives, we have in consequence thought it necessary to make this
   known unto you, that you may understand that we have received and
   acquitted them also, being aware that whatever has been done by
   Eusebius and his fellows against the orthodox has tended to the glory
   and commendation of those who have been attacked by them. It were
   fitting that your Bishop and our brother Athanasius should make this
   known to you respecting them, to his own respecting his own; but as for
   more abundant testimony he wished the holy Council also to write to
   you, we deferred not to do so, but hastened to signify this unto you,
   that you may receive them as we have done, for they also are deserving
   of praise, because through their piety towards Christ they have been
   thought worthy to endure violence at the hands of the heretics.

   What decrees have been passed by the holy Council against those who are
   at the head of the Arian heresy, and have offended against you, and the
   rest of the Churches, you will learn from the subjoined documents [604]
   . We have sent them to you, that you may understand from them that the
   Catholic Church will not overlook those who offend against her.

   Letter of the Council of Sardica to the Bishops of Egypt and Libya.

   The holy Council, by the grace of God assembled at Sardica, to the
   Bishops of Egypt and Libya, their fellow-ministers and dearly beloved
   brethren, sends health in the Lord.

   41. We were not ignorant [605] , but the fact was well known to us,
   even before we received the letters of your piety, that the supporters
   of the abominated heresy of the Arians were practising many dangerous

   and villainy: this is the deadly design in which they have been

   have mingled our tears with yours. And you, brethren, are not the only
   persons who have suffered: many others also of our brethren in ministry
   have come hither, bitterly lamenting these things.

   43. Accordingly, we have written to beseech our most religious and
   godly Emperors, that their kindness would give orders for the release
   of those who are still suffering from affliction and oppression, and

   What decrees have been passed by the holy Council against Theodorus,
   Narcissus, Stephanus, Acacius, Menophantus, Ursacius, Valens, and
   George [607] , who are the heads of the Arian heresy, and have offended
   against you and the rest of the Churches, you will learn from the
   subjoined documents. We have sent them to you, that your piety may
   assent to our decisions, and that you may understand from them, that
   the Catholic Church will not overlook those who offend against her.

   Encyclical Letter of the Council of Sardica.

   The holy Council [608] , by the grace of God, assembled at Sardica, to
   their dearly beloved brethren, the Bishops and fellow-Ministers of the
   Catholic Church every where, sends health in the Lord.

   44. The Arian madmen have dared repeatedly to attack the servants of
   God, who maintain the right faith; they attempted to substitute a
   spurious doctrine, and to drive out the orthodox; and at last they made
   so violent an assault against the Faith, that it became known even to
   the piety of our most religious Emperors. Accordingly, the grace of God
   assisting them, our most religious Emperors have themselves assembled
   us together out of different provinces and cities, and have permitted
   this holy Council to be held in the city of Sardica; to the end that
   all dissension may be done away, and all false doctrine being driven
   from us, Christian godliness may alone be maintained by all men. The
   Bishops of the East also attended, being exhorted to do so by the most
   religious Emperors, chiefly on account of the reports they have so
   often circulated concerning our dearly beloved brethren and
   fellow-ministers Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria, and Marcellus,
   Bishop of Ancyro-Galatia. Their calumnies have probably already reached
   you, and perhaps they have attempted to disturb your ears, that you may
   be induced to believe their charges against the innocent, and that they
   may obliterate from your minds any suspicions respecting their own
   wicked heresy. But they have not been permitted to effect this to any
   great extent; for the Lord is the Defender of His Churches, Who endured
   death for their sakes and for us all, and provided access to heaven for
   us all through Himself. When therefore Eusebius and his fellows wrote
   long ago to Julius our brother and Bishop of the Church of the Romans,
   against our forementioned brethren, that is to say, Athanasius,
   Marcellus, and Asclepas [609] , the Bishops from the other parts wrote
   also, testifying to the innocence of our fellow-minister Athanasius,
   and declaring that the representations of Eusebius and his fellows were
   nothing else but mere falsehood and calumny.

   And indeed their calumnies were clearly proved by the fact that, when
   they were invited to a Council by our dearly beloved fellow-minister
   Julius, they would not come, and also by what was written to them by
   Julius himself. For had they had confidence in the measures and the
   acts in which they were engaged against our brethren, they would have
   come. And besides, they gave a still more evident proof of their
   conspiracy by their conduct in this great and holy Council. For when
   they arrived at the city of Sardica, and saw our brethren Athanasius,
   Marcellus, Asclepas, and the rest, they were afraid to come to a trial
   and though they were repeatedly invited to attend, they would not obey
   the summons. Although all we Bishops met together, and above all that
   man of most happy old age, Hosius, one who on account of his age, his
   confession, and the many labours he has undergone, is worthy of all
   reverence; and although we waited and urged them to come to the trial,
   that in the presence of our fellow-ministers they might establish the
   truth of those charges which they had circulated and written against
   them in their absence; yet they would not come, when they were thus
   invited, as we said before, thus giving proof of their calumnies, and
   almost proclaiming to the world by this their refusal, the plot and
   conspiracy in which they have been engaged. They who are confident of
   the truth of their assertions are able to make them good against their
   opponents face to face. But as they would not meet us, we think that no
   one can now doubt, however they may again have recourse to their bad
   practices, that they possess no proof against our fellow-ministers, but
   calumniate them in their absence, while they avoid their presence.

   45. They fled, beloved brethren, not only on account of the calumnies
   they had uttered, but because they saw that those had come who had
   various charges to advance against them. For chains and irons were
   brought forward which they had used; persons appeared who had returned
   from banishment; there came also our brethren, kinsmen of those who
   were still detained in exile, and friends of such as had perished
   through their means. And what was the most weighty ground of
   accusation, Bishops were present, one [610] of whom brought forward the
   irons and chains which they had caused him to wear, and others appealed
   to the death which had been brought about by their calumnies. For they
   had proceeded to such a pitch of madness, as even to attempt to destroy
   Bishops; and would have destroyed them, had they not escaped their
   hands. Our fellow-ministers, Theodulus of blessed memory [611] , died
   during his flight from their false accusations, orders having been
   given in consequence of these to put him to death. Others also
   exhibited sword-wounds; and others complained that they had been
   exposed to the pains of hunger through their means. Nor were they
   ordinary persons who testified to these things, but whole Churches, in
   whose behalf legates appeared [612] , and told us of soldiers sword in
   hand, of multitudes armed with clubs, of the threats of judges, of the
   forgery of false letters. For there were read certain false letters of
   Theognius and his fellows against our fellow-ministers Athanasius,
   Marcellus, and Asclepas, written with the design of exasperating the
   Emperors against them; and those who had then been Deacons of Theognius
   proved the fact. From these men, we heard of virgins stripped naked,
   churches burnt, ministers in custody, and all for no other end, but
   only for the sake of the accursed heresy of the Arian madmen, whose
   communion whoso refused was forced to suffer these things.

   When they perceived then how matters lay, they were in a strait what
   course to choose. They were ashamed to confess what they had done, but
   were unable to conceal it any longer. They therefore came to the city
   of Sardica, that by their arrival they might seem to remove suspicion
   from themselves of such offences. But when they saw those whom they had
   calumniated, and those who had suffered at their hands; when they had
   before their eyes their accusers and the proofs of their guilt, they
   were unwilling to come forward, though invited by our fellow-ministers
   Athanasius, Marcellus, and Asclepas, who with great freedom complained
   of their conduct, and urged and challenged them to the trial, promising
   not only to refute their calumnies, but also to bring proof of the
   offences which they had committed against their Churches. But they were
   seized with such terrors of conscience, that they fled; and in doing so
   they exposed their own calumnies and confessed by running away the
   offences of which they had been guilty.

   46. But although their malice and their calumnies have been plainly
   manifested on this as well as on former occasions, yet that they may
   not devise means of practising a further mischief in consequence of
   their flight, we have considered it advisable to examine the part they
   have played according to the principles of truth; this has been our
   purpose, and we have found them calumniators by their acts, and authors
   of nothing else than a plot against our brethren in ministry. For
   Arsenius, who they said had been murdered by Athanasius, is still
   alive, and is numbered among the living; from which we may infer that
   the reports they have spread abroad on other subjects are fabrications
   also. And whereas they spread abroad a rumour concerning a cup, which
   they said had been broken by Macarius the Presbyter of Athanasius,
   those who came from Alexandria, the Mareotis, and the other parts,
   testified that nothing of the kind had taken place. And the Egyptian
   Bishops [613] who wrote to Julius our fellow-minister, positively
   affirmed that there had not arisen among them even any suspicion
   whatever of such a thing.

   Moreover, the Reports, which they say they have to produce against him,
   are, as is notorious, ex parte statements; and even in the formation of
   these very Reports, Heathens and Catechumens were examined; one of
   whom, a Catechumen, said [614] in his examination that he was present
   in the room when Macarius broke in upon them; and another declared,
   that Ischyras of whom they speak so much, lay sick in his cell at the
   time; from which it appears that the Mysteries were never celebrated at
   all, because Catechumens were present, and also that Ischyras was not
   present, but was lying sick on his bed. Besides, this most worthless
   Ischyras, who has falsely asserted, as he was convicted of doing, that
   Athanasius had burnt some of the sacred books, has himself confessed
   that he was sick, and was lying in his bed when Macarius came; from
   which it is plain that he is a slanderer. Nevertheless, as a reward for
   these his calumnies, they have given to this very Ischyras the title of
   Bishop, although he is not even a Presbyter. For two Presbyters, who
   were once associated with Meletius, but were afterwards received by the
   blessed Alexander, Bishop of Alexandria, and are now with Athanasius,
   appeared before the Council, and testified that he was not even a
   Presbyter of Meletius, and that Meletius never had either Church or
   Minister in the Mareotis. And yet this man, who has never been even a
   Presbyter, they have now brought forward as a Bishop, that by this name
   they may have the means of overpowering those who are within hearing of
   his calumnies.

   47. The book of our fellow-minister Marcellus was also read, by which
   the fraud of Eusebius and his fellows was plainly discovered. For what
   Marcellus had advanced by way of enquiry [615] , they falsely
   represented as his professed opinion; but when the subsequent parts of
   the book were read, and the parts preceding the queries themselves, his
   faith was found to be correct. He had never pretended, as they
   positively affirmed [616] , that the Word of God had His beginning from
   holy Mary, nor that His kingdom had an end; on the contrary he had
   written that His kingdom was both without beginning and without end.
   Our fellow-minister Asclepas also produced Reports which had been drawn
   up at Antioch in the presence of his accusers and Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea,
   and proved that he was innocent by the declarations of the Bishops who
   judged his cause [617] . They had good reason therefore, dearly beloved
   brethren, for not hearkening to our frequent summons, and for deserting
   the Council. They were driven to this by their own consciences; but
   their flight only confirmed the proof of their own calumnies, and
   caused those things to be believed against them, which their accusers,
   who were present, were asserting and arguing. But besides all these
   things, they had not only received those who were formerly degraded and
   ejected on account of the heresy of Arius, but had even promoted them
   to a higher station, advancing Deacons to the Presbytery, and of
   Presbyters making Bishops, for no other end, but that they might
   disseminate and spread abroad impiety, and corrupt the orthodox faith.

   48. Their leaders are now, after Eusebius and his fellows, Theodorus of
   Heraclea, Narcissus of Neronias in Cilicia, Stephanus of Antioch,
   George of Laodicea, Acacius of CÃ¦sarea in Palestine, Menophantus of
   Ephesus in Asia, Ursacius of Singidunum in Moesia, and Valens of Mursa
   in Pannonia [618] . These men would not permit those who came with them
   from the East to meet the holy Council, nor even to approach the Church
   of God; but as they were coming to Sardica, they held Councils in
   various places by themselves, and made an engagement under threats,
   that when they came to Sardica, they would not so much as appear at the
   trial, nor attend the assembling of the holy Council, but simply coming
   and making known their arrival as a matter of form, would speedily take
   to flight. This we have been able to ascertain from our
   fellow-ministers, Macarius of Palestine and Asterius of Arabia [619] ,
   who after coming in their company, separated themselves from their
   unbelief. These came to the holy Council, and complained of the
   violence they had suffered, and said that no right act was being done
   by them; adding that there were many among them who adhered to
   orthodoxy, but were prevented by those men from coming hither, by means
   of the threats and promises which they held out to those who wished to
   separate from them. On this account it was that they were so anxious
   that all should abide in one dwelling, and would not suffer them to be
   by themselves even for the shortest space of time.

   49. Since then it became us not to hold our peace, nor to pass over
   unnoticed their calumnies, imprisonments, murders, wounds, conspiracies
   by means of false letters, outrages, stripping of the virgins,
   banishments, destruction of the Churches, burnings, translations from
   small cities to larger dioceses, and above all, the rising of the
   ill-named Arian heresy by their means against the orthodox faith; we
   have therefore pronounced our dearly beloved brethren and
   fellow-ministers Athanasius, Marcellus, and Asclepas, and those who
   minister to the Lord with them, to be innocent and clear of offence,
   and have written to the diocese of each, that the people of each Church
   may know the innocence of their own Bishop, and may esteem him as their
   Bishop and expect his coming.

   And as for those who like wolves [620] have invaded their Churches,
   Gregory at Alexandria, Basil at Ancyra, and Quintianus at Gaza, let
   them neither give them the title of Bishop, nor hold any communion at
   all with them, nor receive letters [621] from them, nor write to them.
   And for Theodorus, Narcissus, Acacius, Stephanus, Ursacius, Valens,
   Menophantus, and George, although the last from fear did not come from
   the East, yet because he was deposed by the blessed Alexander, and
   because both he and the others were connected with the Arian madness,
   as well as on account of the charges which lie against them, the holy
   Council has unanimously deposed them from the Episcopate, and we have
   decided that they not only are not Bishops, but that they are unworthy
   of holding communion with the faithful.

   For they who separate the Son and alienate the Word from the Father,
   ought themselves to be separated from the Catholic Church and to be
   alien from the Christian name. Let them therefore be anathema to you,
   because they have corrupted the word of truth [622] .' It is an
   Apostolic injunction [623] , If any man preach any other Gospel unto
   you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.' Charge your
   people that no one hold communion with them, for there is no communion
   of light with darkness; put away from you all these, for there is no
   concord of Christ in Belial [624] . And take heed, dearly beloved, that
   ye neither write to them, nor receive letters from them; but desire
   rather, brethren and fellow-ministers, as being present in spirit [625]
   with our Council, to assent to our judgments by your subscriptions
   [626] , to the end that concord may be preserved by all our
   fellow-ministers everywhere. May Divine Providence protect and keep
   you, dearly beloved brethren, in sanctification and joy.

   I, Hosius, Bishop, have subscribed this, and all the rest likewise.

   of Tyre, which Athan. also attended, but only by compulsion. According
   to the Eusebians at Philippopolis, they had deposed him [17 years
   previously, but the number must be corrupt, or the statement
   incorrect]. They state, however, at the same time, that he had been
   condemned by Athanasius and Marcellus, vid. Hilar. Fragm. iii. 13.
   Sozomen, Hist. iii. 8. says that they deposed him on the charge of
   having overturned an altar; and, after Athan. infr. Â§47, that he was
   acquitted at Sardica on the ground that Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea and others

   of as deceased, seems to have suffered this persecution from the
   Eusebians upon their retreat from Sardica, vid. Athan. Hist. Arian.

   "a vast multitude had congregated at Sardica, of wicked and abandoned
   persons, from Constantinople and Alexandria; who lay under charges of
   murder, blood, slaughter, robbery, plunder, spoiling, and all nameless
   sacrileges and crimes; who had broken altars, burnt Churches, ransacked

   Chapter IV.--Imperial and Ecclesiastical Acts in Consequence of the
   Decision of the Council of Sardica.

   51. When the most religious Emperor Constantius heard of these things,
   he sent for me, having written privately to his brother Constans of
   blessed memory, and to me three several times in the following terms.

   Constantius Victor Augustus to Athanasius [642] . Our benignant
   clemency will not suffer you to be any longer tempest-tossed by the
   wild waves of the sea; for our unwearied piety has not lost sight of
   you, while you have been bereft of your native home, deprived of your
   goods, and have been wandering in savage wildernesses. And although I
   have for a long time deferred expressing by letter the purpose of my
   mind concerning you, principally because I expected that you would
   appear before us of your own accord, and would seek a relief of your
   sufferings; yet forasmuch as fear, it may be, has prevented you from
   fulfilling your intentions, we have therefore addressed to your
   fortitude letters full of our bounty, to the end that you may use all
   speed and without fear present yourself in our presence, thereby to
   obtain the enjoyment of your wishes, and that, having experience of our
   kindness, you may be restored again to your own. For this purpose I
   have besought my lord and brother Constans Victor Augustus, in your
   behalf, that he would give you permission to come, in order that you
   may be restored to your country with the consent of us both, receiving
   this as a pledge of our favour.

   The Second Letter.

   Although we made it very plain to you in a former letter that you may
   without hesitation come to our Court, because we greatly wished to send
   you home, yet, we have further sent this present letter to your
   fortitude to exhort you without any distrust or apprehension, to place
   yourself in the public conveyances [643] , and to hasten to us, that
   you may enjoy the fulfilment of your wishes.

   The Third Letter.

   Our pleasure was, while we abode at Edessa, and your Presbyters were
   there, that, on one of them being sent to you, you should make haste to
   come to our Court, in order that you might see our face, and
   straightway proceed to Alexandria. But as a very long period has
   elapsed since you received letters from us, and you have not yet come,
   we therefore hasten to remind you again, that you may endeavour even
   now to present yourself before us with speed, and so may be restored to
   your country, and obtain the accomplishment of your prayers. And for
   your fuller information we have sent Achitas the Deacon, from whom you
   will be able to learn the purpose of our soul, that you may now secure
   the objects of your prayers.

   Such was the tenor of the Emperor's letters; on receiving which I went
   up to Rome to bid farewell to the Church and the Bishop: for I was at
   Aquileia [644] when the above was written. The Church was filled with
   all joy, and the Bishop Julius rejoiced with me in my return and wrote
   to the Church [645] ; and as we passed along, the Bishops of every
   place sent us on our way in peace. The letter of Julius was as follows.

   52. Julius to the Presbyters, Deacons, and people residing at
   Alexandria [646] .

   I congratulate you, beloved brethren, that you now behold the fruit of
   your faith before your eyes; for any one may see that such indeed is
   the case with respect to my brother and fellow-Bishop Athanasius, whom
   for the innocency of his life, and by reason of your prayers, God is
   restoring to you again. Wherefore it is easy to perceive, that you have
   continually offered up to God pure prayers and full of love. Being
   mindful of the heavenly promises, and of the conversation that leads to
   them, which you have learnt from the teaching of my brother aforesaid,
   you knew certainly and understood by the right faith that is in you,
   that he, whom you always had as present in your most pious minds, would
   not be separated from you for ever. Wherefore there is no need that I
   should use many words in writing to you; for your faith has already
   anticipated whatever I could say to you, and has by the grace of God
   procured the accomplishment of the common prayers of you all.
   Therefore, I repeat again, I congratulate you, because you have
   preserved your souls unconquered in the faith; and I also congratulate
   no less my brother Athanasius, in that, though he is enduring many
   afflictions, he has at no time been forgetful of your love and earnest
   desires towards him. For although for a season he seemed to be
   withdrawn from you in body, yet he has continued to live as always
   present with you in spirit [647] .

   53. Wherefore he returns to you now more illustrious than when he went
   away from you. Fire tries and purifies the precious materials, gold and
   silver: but how can one describe the worth of such a man, who, having
   passed victorious through the perils of so many tribulations, is now
   restored to you, being pronounced innocent not by our voice only, but
   by the voice of the whole Council [648] ? Receive therefore, beloved
   brethren, with all godly honour and rejoicing, your Bishop Athanasius,
   together with those who have been partners with him in so many labours.
   And rejoice that you now obtain the fulfilment of your prayers, after
   that in your salutary letter you have given meat and drink to your
   Pastor, who, so to speak, longed and thirsted after your godliness. For
   while he sojourned in a foreign land, you were his consolation; and you
   refreshed him during his persecutions by your most faithful minds and
   spirits. And it delights me now to conceive and figure to my mind the
   joy of every one of you at his return, and the pious greetings of the
   concourse, and the glorious festivity of those that run to meet him.
   What a day will that be to you, when my brother comes back again, and
   your former sufferings terminate, and his much-prized and desired
   return inspires you all with an exhilaration of perfect joy! The like
   joy it is ours to feel in a very great degree, since it has been
   granted us by God, to be able to make the acquaintance of so eminent a
   man. It is fitting therefore that I should conclude my letter with a
   prayer. May Almighty God, and His Son our Lord and Saviour Jesus
   Christ, afford you continual grace, giving you a reward for the
   admirable faith which you displayed in your noble confession in behalf
   of your Bishop, that He may impart unto you and unto them that are with
   you, both here and hereafter, those better things, which the eye hath
   not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath entered into the heart of man,
   the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him [649] ,'
   through our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom to Almighty God be glory
   for ever and ever. Amen. I pray, dearly beloved brethren, for your
   health and strength in the Lord.

   54. The Emperor, when I came to him [650] with these letters, received
   me kindly, and sent me forth to my country and Church addressing the
   following to the Bishops, Presbyters, and People.

   Constantius, Victor, Maximus, Augustus, to the Bishops and Presbyters
   of the Catholic Church.

   The most reverend Athanasius has not been deserted by the grace of God,
   but although for a brief season he was subjected to trial to which
   human nature is liable, he has obtained from the all-surveying
   Providence such an answer to his prayers as was meet, and is restored
   by the will of the Most High, and by our sentence, at once to his
   country and to the Church, over which by divine permission he presided.
   Wherefore, in accordance with this, it is fitting that it should be
   provided by our clemency, that all the decrees which have heretofore
   been passed against those who held communion with him, be now consigned
   to oblivion, and that all suspicions respecting them be henceforward
   set at rest, and that immunity, such as the Clergy who are associated
   with him formerly enjoyed, be duly confirmed to them. Moreover to our
   other acts of favour towards him we have thought good to add the
   following, that all persons of the sacred catalogue [651] should
   understand, that an assurance of safety is given to all who adhere to
   him, whether Bishops, or other Clergy. And union with him will be a
   sufficient guarantee, in the case of any person, of an upright
   intention. For whoever, acting according to a better judgment and part,
   shall choose to hold communion with him, we order, in imitation of that
   Providence which has already gone before, that all such should have the
   advantage of the grace which by the will of the Most High is now
   offered to them from us. May God preserve you.

   The Second Letter.

   Constantius, Victor, Maximus, Augustus, to the people of the Catholic
   Church at Alexandria.

   55. Having in view your welfare in all respects, and knowing that you
   have for a long time been deprived of episcopal superintendence, we
   have thought good to send back to you your Bishop Athanasius, a man
   known to all men for the uprightness that is in him, and for the good
   disposition of his personal character. Receive him, as you are wont to
   receive every one, in a suitable manner, and, using his advocacy as
   your succour in your prayers to God, endeavour to preserve continually
   that unanimity and peace according to the order of the Church which is
   at the same time becoming in you, and most advantageous for us. For it
   is not becoming that any dissension or faction should be raised among
   you, contrary to the prosperity of our times. We desire that this
   offence may be altogether removed from you, and we exhort you to
   continue stedfastly in your accustomed prayers, and to make him, as we
   said before, your advocate and helper towards God. So that, when this
   your determination, beloved, has influenced the prayers of all men,
   even those heathen who are still addicted to the false worship of idols
   may eagerly desire to come to the knowledge of our sacred religion.
   Again therefore we exhort you to continue in these things, and gladly
   to receive your Bishop, who is sent back to you by the decree of the
   Most High, and by our decision, and determine to greet him cordially
   with all your soul and with all your mind. For this is what is both
   becoming in you, and agreeable to our clemency. In order that all
   occasions of disturbance and sedition may be taken away from those who
   are maliciously disposed, we have by letter commanded the magistrates
   who are among you to subject to the vengeance of the law all whom they
   find to be factious. Wherefore taking into consideration both these
   things, our decision in accordance with the will of the Most High, and
   our regard for you and for concord among you, and the punishment that
   awaits the disorderly, observe such things as are proper and suitable
   to the order of our sacred religion, and receiving the afore-mentioned
   Bishop with all reverence and honour, take care to offer up with him
   your prayers to God, the Father of all, in behalf of yourselves, and
   for the well-being of your whole lives.

   56. Having written these letters, he also commanded that the decrees,
   which he had formerly sent out against me in consequence of the
   calumnies of Eusebius and his fellows, should be cancelled and struck
   out from the Orders of the Duke and the Prefect of Egypt; and Eusebius
   the Decurion [652] was sent to withdraw them from the Order-books. His
   letter on this occasion was as follows.

   Constantius, Victor, Augustus, to Nestorius [653] . (And in the same
   terms, to the Governors of Augustamnica, the Thebais, and Libya.)

   Whatever Orders are found to have been passed heretofore, tending to
   the injury and dishonour of those who hold communion with the Bishop
   Athanasius, we wish them to be now erased. For we desire that whatever
   immunities his Clergy possessed before, they should again possess the
   same. And we wish this our Order to be observed, that when the Bishop
   Athanasius is restored to his Church, those who hold communion with him
   may enjoy the immunities which they have always enjoyed, and which the
   rest of the Clergy enjoy; so that they may have the satisfaction of
   being on an equal footing with others.

   57. Being thus set forward on my journey, as I passed through Syria, I
   met with the Bishops of Palestine, who when they had called a Council
   [654] at Jerusalem, received me cordially, and themselves also sent me
   on my way in peace, and addressed the following letter to the Church
   and the Bishops.

   The Holy Council, assembled at Jerusalem, to the fellow-ministers in
   Egypt and Libya, and to the Presbyters, Deacons, and People at
   Alexandria, brethren beloved and greatly longed for, sends health in
   the Lord.

   We cannot give worthy thanks to the God of all, dearly beloved, for the
   wonderful things which He has done at all times, and especially at this
   time for your Church, in restoring to you your pastor and lord, and our
   fellow-minister Athanasius. For who ever hoped that his eyes would see
   what you are now actually obtaining? Of a truth, your prayers have been
   heard by the God of all, Who cares for His Church, and has looked upon
   your tears and groans, and has therefore heard your petitions. For ye
   were as sheep scattered and fainting, not having a shepherd [655] .
   Wherefore the true Shepherd, Who careth for His own sheep, has visited
   you from heaven, and has restored to you him whom you desire. Behold,
   we also, being ready to do all things for the peace of the Church, and
   being prompted by the same affection as yourselves, have saluted him
   before you; and communicating with you through him, we send you these
   greetings, and our offering of thanksgiving, that you may know that we
   also are united in the bond of love that joins you to him. You are
   bound to pray also for the piety of our most God-beloved Emperors, who,
   when they knew your earnest longings after him, and his innocency,
   determined to restore him to you with all honour. Wherefore receive him
   with uplifted hands, and take good heed that you offer up due
   thanksgiving on his behalf to God Who has bestowed these blessings upon
   you; so that you may continually rejoice with God and glorify our Lord,
   in Christ Jesus our Lord, through Whom to the Father be glory for ever.
   Amen.

   I have set down here the names of those who subscribed this letter,
   although I have mentioned them before [656] . They are these; Maximus,
   Aetius, Arius, Theodorus [657] , Germanus, Silvanus, Paulus, Patricius,
   Elpidius, Germanus, Eusebius, Zenobius, Paulus, Macrinus [658] ,
   Petrus, Claudius.

   58. When Ursacius and Valens saw all this, they forthwith condemned
   themselves for what they had done, and going up to Rome, confessed
   their crime, declared themselves penitent, and sought forgiveness [659]
   , addressing the following letters to Julius, Bishop of ancient Rome,
   and to ourselves. Copies of them were sent to me from Paulinus, Bishop
   of Treveri [660] .

   A Translation from the Latin of a Letter [661] to Julius, concerning
   the recantation of Ursacius and Valens [662] .

   Ursacius and Valens to the most blessed lord, pope Julius.

   Whereas it is well known that we have heretofore in letters laid many
   grievous charges against the Bishop Athanasius, and whereas when we
   were corrected by the letters of your Goodness, we were unable to
   render an account of the statement we had made; we do now confess
   before your Goodness, and in the presence of all the Presbyters our
   brethren, that all the reports which have heretofore come to your
   hearing respecting the case of the aforesaid Athanasius, are falsehoods
   and fabrications, and are utterly inconsistent with his character.
   Wherefore we earnestly desire communion with the aforesaid Athanasius,
   especially since your Piety, with your characteristic generosity, has
   vouchsafed to pardon our error. But we also declare, that if at any
   time the Eastern Bishops, or even Athanasius himself, ungenerously
   should wish to bring us to judgment for this matter, we will not depart
   contrary to your judgment. And as for the heretic Arius and his
   supporters, who say that once the Son was not, and that the Son was
   made of that which was not, and who deny that Christ is God and the Son
   of God before the worlds, we anathematize them both now and for
   evermore, as also we have set forth in our former declaration at Milan
   [663] . We have written this with our own hands, and we profess again,
   that we have renounced for ever, as we said before, the Arian heresy
   and its authors.

   I Ursacius subscribed this my confession in person; and likewise I
   Valens.

   Ursacius and Valens, Bishops, to their lord and brother, the Bishop
   Athanasius.

   Having an opportunity of sending by our brother and fellow Presbyter
   MusÃ¦us, who is coming to your Charity, we salute you affectionately,
   beloved brother, through him, from Aquileia, and pray you, being as we
   trust in health, to read our letter. You will also give us confidence,
   if you will return to us an answer in writing. For know that we are at
   peace with you, and in communion with the Church, of which the
   salutation prefixed to this letter is a proof. May Divine Providence
   preserve you, my Lord, our beloved brother!

   Such were their letters, and such the sentence and the judgment of the
   Bishops in my behalf. But in order to prove that they did not act thus
   to ingratiate themselves, or under compulsion in any quarter, I desire,
   with your permission, to recount the whole matter from the beginning,
   so that you may perceive that the bishops wrote as they did with
   upright and just intentions, and that Ursacius and Valens, though they
   were slow to do so, at last confessed the truth.

   Part II.

   Chapter V.--Documents connected with the charges of the Meletians
   against S. Athanasius.

   59. Peter was Bishop among us before the persecution, and during the
   course of it he suffered martyrdom. When Meletius, who held the title
   of bishop in Egypt, was convicted of many crimes, and among the rest of
   offering sacrifice to idols, Peter deposed him in a general council of
   the bishops. Whereupon Meletius did not appeal to another council, or
   attempt to justify himself before those who should come after, but made
   a schism, so that they who espoused his cause are even yet called
   Meletians instead of Christians [664] . He began immediately to revile
   the bishops, and made false accusations, first against Peter himself,
   and against his successor Achillas, and after Achillas, against
   Alexander [665] . And he thus practised craftily, following the example
   of Absalom, to the end that, as he was disgraced by his deposition, he
   might by his calumnies mislead the simple. While Meletius was thus
   employed, the Arian heresy also had arisen. But in the Council of
   NicÃ¦a, while the heresy was anathematized, and the Arians were cast
   out, the Meletians on whatever grounds [666] (for it is not necessary
   now to mention the reason) were received. Five months however had not
   yet passed [667] when, the blessed Alexander having died, the
   Meletians, who ought to have remained quiet, and to have been grateful
   that they were received on any terms, like dogs unable to forget their
   vomit, were again troubling the Churches.

   Upon learning this, Eusebius, who had the lead in the Arian heresy,
   sends and buys the Meletians with large promises, becomes their secret
   friend, and arranges with them for their assistance on any occasion
   when he might wish for it. At first he sent to me, urging me to admit
   Arius and his fellows to communion [668] , and threatened me in his
   verbal communications, while in his letters he [merely] made a request.
   And when I refused, declaring that it was not right that those who had
   invented heresy contrary to the truth, and had been anathematized by
   the Ecumenical [669] Council, should be admitted to communion, he
   caused the Emperor also, Constantine, of blessed memory, to write to
   me, threatening me, in case I should not receive Arius and his fellows,
   with those afflictions, which I have before undergone, and which I am
   still suffering. The following is a part of his letter. Syncletius and
   Gaudentius, officers of the palace [670] , were the bearers of it.

   Part of a Letter from the Emperor Constantine.

   Having therefore knowledge of my will, grant free admission to all who
   wish to enter into the Church. For if I learn that you have hindered or
   excluded any who claim to be admitted into communion with the Church, I
   will immediately send some one who shall depose you by my command, and
   shall remove you from your place.

   60. When upon this I wrote and endeavoured to convince the Emperor,
   that that anti-Christian heresy had no communion with the Catholic
   Church, Eusebius forthwith, availing himself of the occasion which he
   had agreed upon with the Meletians, writes and persuades them to invent
   some pretext, so that, as they had practised against Peter and Achillas
   and Alexander, they might devise and spread reports against us also.
   Accordingly, after seeking for a long time, and finding nothing, they
   at last agree together, with the advice of Eusebius and his fellows,
   and fabricate their first accusation by means of Ision, EudÃ¦mon, and
   Callinicus [671] , respecting the linen vestments [672] , to the effect
   that I had imposed a law upon the Egyptians, and had required its
   observance of them first. But when certain Presbyters of mine were
   found to be present, and the Emperor took cognizance of the matter,
   they were condemned (the Presbyters were Apis and Macarius), and the
   Emperor wrote, condemning Ision, and ordering me to appear before him.
   His letters were as follows [673] .

   Eusebius, having intelligence of this, persuades them to wait; and when
   I arrive, they next accuse Macarius of breaking the cup, and bring
   against me the most heinous accusation possible, viz. that, being an
   enemy of the Emperor, I had sent a purse of gold to one Philumenus. The
   Emperor therefore heard us on this charge also in Psammathia [674] ,
   when they, as usual, were condemned, and driven from the presence; and,
   as I returned, he wrote the following letter to the people.

   Constantine, Maximus, Augustus, to the people of the Catholic Church at
   Alexandria.

   61. Beloved brethren, I greet you well, calling upon God, Who is the
   chief witness of my intention, and on the Only-begotten, the Author of
   our Law, Who is Sovereign over the lives of all men, and Who hates
   dissensions. But what shall I say to you? That I am in good health?
   Nay, but I should be able to enjoy better health and strength, if you
   were possessed with mutual love one towards another, and had rid
   yourselves of your enmities, through which, in consequence of the
   storms excited by contentious men, we have left the haven of brotherly
   love. Alas! what perverseness is this! What evil consequences are
   produced every day by the tumult of envy which has been stirred up
   among you! Hence it is that evil reports have settled upon the people
   of God. Whither has the faith of righteousness departed? For we are so
   involved in the mists of darkness, not only through manifold errors,
   but through the faults of ungrateful men, that we bear with those who
   favour folly, and though we are aware of them, take no heed of those
   who set aside goodness and truth. What strange inconsistency is this!
   We do not convict our enemies, but we follow the example of robbery
   which they set us, whereby the most pernicious errors, finding no one
   to oppose them, easily, if I may so speak, make a way for themselves.
   Is there no understanding among us, for the credit of our common
   nature, since we are thus neglectful of the injunctions of the law?

   But some one will say, that love is a thing brought out by nature. But,
   I ask, how is it that we who have got the law of God for our guide in
   addition to our natural advantages, thus tolerate the disturbances and
   disorders raised by our enemies, who seem inflamed, as it were, with
   firebrands? How is it, that having eyes, we see not, neither
   understand, though we are surrounded by the intelligence of the law?
   What a stupor has seized upon our life, that we are thus neglectful of
   ourselves, and that although God admonishes us! Is it not an
   intolerable evil? and ought we not to esteem such men as our enemies,
   and not the household and people of God? For they are infuriated
   against us, abandoned as they are: they lay grievous crimes to our
   charge, and make attacks upon us as enemies.

   62. And I would have you yourselves to consider with what exceeding
   madness they do this. The foolish men carry their maliciousness at
   their tongues' end. They carry about with them a sort of leaden anger,
   so that they reciprocally smite one another, and involve us by way of
   increasing their own punishment. The good teacher is accounted an
   enemy, while he who clothes himself with the vice of envy, contrary to
   all justice makes his gain of the gentle temper of the people; he
   ravages, and consumes, he decks himself out, and recommends himself
   with false praises; he subverts the truth, and corrupts the faith,
   until he finds out a hole and hiding-place for his conscience. Thus
   their very perverseness makes them wretched, while they impudently
   prefer themselves to places of honour, however unworthy they may be.
   Ah! what a mischief is this! they say "Such an one is too old; such an
   one is a mere boy; the office belongs to me; it is due to me, since it
   is taken away from him. I will gain over all men to my side, and then I
   will endeavour with my power to ruin him." Plain indeed is this
   proclamation of their madness to all the world; the sight of companies,
   and gatherings, and rowers under command [675] in their offensive
   cabals. Alas! what preposterous conduct is ours, if I may say it! Do
   they make an exhibition of their folly in the Church of God? And are
   they not yet ashamed of themselves? Do they not yet blame themselves?
   Are they not smitten in their consciences, so that they now at length
   shew that they entertain a proper sense of their deceit and
   contentiousness? Theirs is the mere force of envy, supported by those
   baneful influences which naturally belong to it. But those wretches
   have no power against your Bishop. Believe me, brethren, their
   endeavours will have no other effect than this, after they have worn
   down our days, to leave to themselves no place of repentance in this
   life. Wherefore I beseech you, lend help to yourselves; receive kindly
   our love, and with all your strength drive away those who desire to
   obliterate from among us the grace of unanimity; and looking unto God,
   love one another. I received gladly your Bishop Athanasius, and
   addressed him in such a manner, as being persuaded that he was a man of
   God. It is for you to understand these things, not for me to judge of
   them. I thought it becoming that the most reverend Athanasius himself
   should convey my salutation to you, knowing his kind care of you,
   which, in a manner worthy of that peaceable faith which I myself
   profess, is continually engaged in the good work of declaring saving
   knowledge, and will be able to exhort you as is suitable, May God
   preserve you, beloved brethren.

   Such was the letter of Constantine.

   63. After these occurrences the Meletians remained quiet for a little
   time, but afterwards shewed their hostility again, and contrived the
   following plot, with the aim of pleasing those who had hired their
   services. The Mareotis is a country district of Alexandria, in which
   Meletius was not able to make a schism. Now while the Churches still
   existed within their appointed limits, and all the Presbyters had
   congregations in them, and while the people were living in peace, a
   certain person named Ischyras [676] , who was not a clergyman, but of a
   worthless disposition, endeavoured to lead astray the people of his own
   village, declaring himself to be a clergyman. Upon learning this, the
   Presbyter of the place informed me of it when I was going through my
   visitation of the Churches, and I sent Macarius the Presbyter with him
   to summon Ischyras. They found him sick and lying in a cell, and
   charged his father to admonish his son not to continue any such
   practices as had been reported against him. But when he recovered from
   his sickness, being prevented by his friends and his father from
   pursuing the same course, he fled over to the Meletians; and they
   communicate with Eusebius and his fellows, and at last that calumny is
   invented by them, that Macarius had broken a cup, and that a certain
   Bishop named Arsenius had been murdered by me. Arsenius they placed in
   concealment, in order that he might seem made away with, when he did
   not make his appearance; and they carried about a hand, pretending that
   he had been cut to pieces. As for Ischyras, whom they did not even
   know, they began to spread a report that he was a Presbyter, in order
   that what he said about the cup might mislead the people. Ischyras,
   however, being censured by his friends, came to me weeping, and said
   that no such thing as they had reported had been done by Macarius, and
   that himself had been suborned by the Meletians to invent this calumny.
   And he wrote the following letter.

   To the Blessed pope [677] Athanasius, Ischyras sends health in the
   Lord.

   64. As when I came to you, my Lord Bishop, desiring to be received into
   the Church, you reproved me for what I formerly said, as though I had
   proceeded to such lengths of my own free choice, I therefore submit to
   you this my apology in writing, in order that you may understand, that
   violence was used towards me, and blows inflicted on me by Isaac and
   Heraclides, and Isaac of Letopolis, and those of their party. And I
   declare, and take God as my witness in this matter, that of none of the
   things which they have stated, do I know you to be guilty. For no
   breaking of a cup or overturning of the Holy Table ever took place, but
   they compelled me by violent usage to assert all this. And this defence
   I make and submit to you in writing, desiring and claiming for myself
   to be admitted among the members of your congregation. I pray that you
   may have health in the Lord.

   I submit this my handwriting to you the Bishop Athanasius in the
   presence of the Presbyters, Ammonas of Dicella, Heraclius of Phascos,
   Boccon of Chenebri, Achillas of Myrsine, Didymus of Taphosiris, and
   Justus from Bomotheus [678] ; and of the Deacons, Paul, Peter, and
   Olympius, of Alexandria, and Ammonius, Pistus, Demetrius, and Gaius, of
   the Mareotis.

   65. Notwithstanding this statement of Ischyras, they again spread
   abroad the same charges against me everywhere, and also reported them
   to the Emperor Constantine. He too had heard before of the affair of
   the cup in Psammathia [679] , when I was there, and had detected the
   falsehood of my enemies. But now he wrote to Antioch to Dalmatius [680]
   the Censor requiring him to institute a judicial enquiry respecting the
   murder. Accordingly the Censor sent me notice to prepare for my defence
   against the charge. Upon receiving his letters, although at first I
   paid no regard to the thing because I knew that nothing of what they
   said was true, yet seeing that the Emperor was moved, I wrote to my
   fellow-ministers into Egypt, and sent a deacon, desiring to learn
   something of Arsenius, for I had not seen the man for five or six
   years. Well, not to relate the matter at length, Arsenius was found in
   concealment, in the first instance in Egypt, and afterwards my friends
   discovered him again in concealment in Tyre also. And what was most
   remarkable, even when he was discovered he would not confess that he
   was Arsenius, until he was convicted in court before Paul, who was then
   Bishop of Tyre, and at last out of very shame could not deny it.

   This he did in order to fulfil his contract with Eusebius and his
   fellows, lest, if he were discovered, the game they were playing should
   at length be broken up; which in fact came to pass. For when I wrote
   the Emperor word, that Arsenius was discovered, and reminded him of
   what he had heard in Psammathia concerning Macarius the Presbyter, he
   stopped the proceedings of the Censor's court, and wrote condemning the
   proceedings against me as calumnious, and commanded Eusebius and his
   fellows, who were coming into the East to appear against me, to return.
   Now in order to shew that they accused me of having murdered Arsenius
   (not to bring forward the letters of many persons on the subject), it
   shall be sufficient only to produce one from Alexander the Bishop of
   Thessalonica, from which the tenor of the rest may be inferred. He then
   being acquainted with the reports which Archaph, who is also called
   John, circulated against me on the subject of the murder, and having
   heard that Arsenius was alive, wrote as follows.

   Letter of Alexander.

   To his dearly beloved son and fellow-minister like-minded, the lord
   Athanasius, Alexander the Bishop sends health in the Lord.

   66. I congratulate the most excellent Sarapion, that he is striving so
   earnestly to adorn himself with holy habits, and is thus advancing to
   higher praise the memory of his father. For, as the Holy Scripture
   somewhere says, though his father die, yet he is as though he were not
   dead [681] :' for he has left behind him a memorial of his life. What
   my feelings were towards the ever memorable Sozon, you yourself, my
   lord [682] , are not ignorant, for you know the sacredness of his
   memory, as well as the goodness of the young man. I have received only
   one letter from your reverence, which I had by the hands of this youth.
   I mention this to you, my lord, in order that you may know. Our dearly
   beloved brother and deacon Macarius, afforded me great pleasure by
   writing to me from Constantinople, that the false accuser Archaph had
   met with disgrace, for having given out before all men that a live man
   had been murdered. That he will receive from the righteous Judge,
   together with all the tribe of his associates, that punishment, which
   his crimes deserve, the unerring Scriptures assure us. May the Lord of
   all preserve you for very many years, my lord, in every way most kind.

   67. And they who lived with Arsenius bear witness, that he was kept in
   concealment for this purpose, that they might pretend his death; for in
   searching after him we found the person [who had done so], and he in
   consequence wrote the following letter to John, who played the chief
   part in this false accusation.

   To his dearly beloved brother John, Pinnes, Presbyter of the Monastery
   [683] of Ptemencyrcis, in the home of Anteopolis, sends greeting.

   I wish you to know, that Athanasius sent his deacon into the Thebais,
   to search everywhere for Arsenius; and Pecysius the Presbyter, and
   Silvanus the brother of Helias, and Tapenacerameus, and Paul monk of
   Hypsele, whom he first fell in with, confessed that Arsenius was with
   us. Upon learning this we caused him to be put on board a vessel, and
   to sail to the lower countries with Helias the monk. Afterwards the
   deacon returned again suddenly with certain others, and entered our
   monastery, in search of the same Arsenius, and him they found not,
   because, as I said before, we had sent him away to the lower countries;
   but they conveyed me together with Helias the monk, who took him out of
   the way, to Alexandria, and brought us before the Duke [684] ; when I
   was unable to deny, but confessed that he was alive, and had not been
   murdered: the monk also who took him out of the way confessed the same.
   Wherefore I acquaint you with these things, Father, lest you should
   determine to accuse Athanasius; for I said that he was alive, and had
   been concealed with us, and all this is become known in Egypt, and it
   cannot any longer be kept secret.

   I, Paphnutius, monk of the same monastery, who wrote this letter,
   heartily salute you. I pray for your health.

   The following also is the letter which the Emperor wrote when he learnt
   that Arsenius was found to be alive.

   Constantine, Victor, Maximus, Augustus, to the pope Athanasius.

   68. Having read the letters of your wisdom, I felt the inclination to
   write in return to your fortitude, and to exhort you that you would
   endeavour to restore the people of God to tranquillity, and to merciful
   feelings. For in my own mind I hold these things to be of the greatest
   importance, that we should cultivate truth, and ever keep righteousness
   in our thoughts, and have pleasure especially in those who walk in the
   right way of life. But as concerning those who are deserving of all
   execration, I mean the most perverse and ungodly Meletians, who have at
   last stultified themselves by their folly, and are now raising
   unreasonable commotions by envy, uproar, and tumult, thus making
   manifest their own ungodly dispositions, I will say thus much. You see
   that those who they pretended had been slain with the sword, are still
   amongst us, and in the enjoyment of life. Now what could be a stronger
   presumption against them, and one so manifestly and clearly tending to
   their condemnation, as that those whom they declared to have been
   murdered, are yet in the enjoyment of life, and accordingly will be
   able to speak for themselves?

   But this further accusation was advanced by these same Meletians. They
   positively affirmed that you, rushing in with lawless violence, had
   seized upon and broken a cup, which was deposited in the most Holy
   Place; than which there certainly could not be a more serious charge,
   nor a more grievous offence, had such a crime actually been
   perpetrated. But what manner of accusation is this? What is the meaning
   of this change and variation and difference in the circumstances of it,
   insomuch that they now transfer this same accusation to another person
   [685] , a fact which makes it clearer, so to speak, than the light
   itself, that they designed to lay a plot for your wisdom? After this,
   who can be willing to follow them, men that have fabricated such
   charges to the injury of another, seeing too that they are hurrying
   themselves on to ruin, and are conscious that they are accusing you of
   false and feigned crimes? Who then, as I said, will follow after them,
   and thus go headlong in the way of destruction; in that way in which it
   seems they alone suppose that they have hope of safety and of help? But
   if they were willing to walk according to a pure conscience, and to be
   directed by the best wisdom, and to go in the way of a sound mind, they
   would easily perceive that no help can come to them from Divine
   Providence, while they are given up to such doings, and tempt their own
   destruction. I should not call this a harsh judgment of them, but the
   simple truth.

   And finally, I will add, that I wish this letter to be read frequently
   by your wisdom in public, that it may thereby come to the knowledge of
   all men, and especially reach the ears of those who thus act, and thus
   raise disturbances; for the judgment which is expressed by me according
   to the dictates of equity is confirmed also by real facts. Wherefore,
   seeing that in such conduct there is so great an offence, let them
   understand that I have thus judged; and that I have come to this
   determination, that if they excite any further commotion of this kind,
   I will myself in person take cognizance of the matter, and that not
   according to the ecclesiastical, but according to the civil laws, and
   so I will in future find them out, because they clearly are robbers, so
   to speak, not only against human kind, but against the divine doctrine
   itself. May God ever preserve you, beloved brother!

   69. But that the wickedness of the calumniators might be more fully
   displayed, behold Arsenius also wrote to me after he was discovered in
   his place of concealment; and as the letter which Ischyras had written
   confessed the falsehood of their accusation, so that of Arsenius proved
   their maliciousness still more completely.

   To the blessed Pope Athanasius, Arsenius, Bishop of those who were
   heretofore under Meletius in the city of the Hypselites, together with
   the Presbyters and Deacons, wishes much health in the Lord.

   Being earnestly desirous of peace and union with the Catholic Church,
   over which by the grace of God you preside, and wishing to submit
   ourselves to the Canon of the Church, according to the ancient rule
   [686] , we write unto you, dearly beloved Pope, and declare in the name
   of the Lord, that we will not for the future hold communion with those
   who continue in schism, and are not yet at peace with the Catholic
   Church, whether Bishops, Presbyters, or Deacons. Neither will we take
   part with them if they wish to establish anything in a Council; neither
   will we send letters of peace [687] unto them nor receive such from
   them; neither yet without the consent of you, the bishop of the
   metropolis, will we publish any determination concerning Bishops, or on
   any other general ecclesiastical question; but we will yield obedience
   to all the canons that have heretofore been ordained, after the example
   of the Bishops [688] Ammonian, Tyrannus, Plusian, and the rest.
   Wherefore we beseech your goodness to write to us speedily in answer,
   and likewise to our fellow-ministers concerning us, informing them that
   we will henceforth abide by the fore-mentioned resolution and will be
   at peace with the Catholic Church, and at unity with our
   fellow-ministers in the [various] districts. And we are persuaded that
   your prayers, being acceptable unto God, will so prevail with Him, that
   this peace shall be firm and indissoluble unto the end, according to
   the will of God the Lord of all, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

   The sacred Ministry that is under you, we and those that are with us
   salute. Very shortly, if God permit, we will come to visit your
   goodness. I, Arsenius, pray for your health in the Lord for many years,
   most blessed Pope.

   70. But a stronger and clearer proof of the calumny against us is the
   recantation of John, of which the most God-beloved Emperor Constantine
   of blessed memory is a witness, for knowing how John had accused
   himself, and having received letters from him expressing his
   repentance, he wrote to him as follows.

   Constantine, Maximus, Augustus to John.

   The letters which I have received from your prudence were extremely
   pleasing to me, because I learned from them what I very much longed to
   hear, that you had laid aside every petty feeling, had joined the
   Communion of the Church as became you, and were now in perfect concord
   with the most reverend Bishop Athanasius. Be assured therefore that so
   far I entirely approve of your conduct; because, giving up all
   skirmishing, you have done that which is pleasing to God, and have
   embraced the unity of His Church. In order therefore that you may
   obtain the accomplishment of your wishes, I have thought it right to
   grant you permission to enter the public conveyance [689] , and to come
   to the court [690] of my clemency. Let it then be your care to make no
   delay; but as this letter gives you authority to use the public
   conveyance, come to me immediately, that you may have your desires
   fulfilled, and by appearing in my presence may enjoy that pleasure
   which it is fit for you to receive. May God preserve you continually,
   dearly beloved brother.

   Chapter VI.--Documents connected with the Council of Tyre.

   71. Thus ended the conspiracy. The Meletians were repulsed and covered
   with shame; but notwithstanding this Eusebius and his fellows still did
   not remain quiet, for it was not for the Meletians but for Arius and
   his fellows, that they cared, and they were afraid lest, if the
   proceedings of the former should be stopped, they should no longer find
   persons to play the parts [691] , by whose assistance they might bring
   in that heresy. They therefore again stirred up the Meletians, and
   persuaded the Emperor to give orders that a Council should be held
   afresh at Tyre, and Count Dionysius was despatched thither, and a
   military guard was given to Eusebius and his fellows. Macarius also was
   sent as a prisoner to Tyre under a guard of soldiers; and the Emperor
   wrote to me, and laid a peremptory command upon me, so that, however
   unwilling, I set out. The whole conspiracy may be understood from the
   letters which the Bishops of Egypt wrote; but it will be necessary to
   relate how it was contrived by them in the outset, that so may be
   perceived the malice and wickedness that was exercised against me.
   There are in Egypt, Libya, and Pentapolis, nearly one hundred Bishops;
   none of whom laid anything to my charge; none of the Presbyters found
   any fault with me; none of the people spoke aught against me; but it
   was the Meletians who were ejected by Peter, and the Arians, that
   divided the plot between them, while the one party claimed to
   themselves the right of accusing me, the other of sitting in judgment
   on the case. I objected to Eusebius and his fellows as being my enemies
   on account of the heresy; next, I shewed in the following manner that
   the person who was called my accuser was not a Presbyter at all. When
   Meletius was admitted into communion (would that he had never been so
   admitted [692] !) the blessed Alexander who knew his craftiness
   required of him a schedule of the Bishops whom he said he had in Egypt,
   and of the presbyters and deacons that were in Alexandria itself, and
   if he had any in the country district. This the Pope Alexander has
   done, lest Meletius, having received the freedom of the Church, should
   tender [693] many, and thus continually, by a fraudulent procedure,
   foist upon us whomsoever he pleased. Accordingly he has made out the
   following schedule of those in Egypt.

   A schedule presented by Meletius to the Bishop Alexander.

   I, Meletius of Lycopolis, Lucius of Antinopolis, Phasileus of
   Hermopolis, Achilles of CusÃ¦, Ammonius of Diospolis.

   In Ptolemais, Pachymes of TentyrÃ¦.

   In Maximianopolis, Theodorus of Coptus.

   In Thebais, Cales of Hermethes, Colluthus of Upper Cynopolis, Pelagius
   of Oxyrynchus, Peter of Heracleopolis, Theon of Nilopolis, Isaac [694]
   of Letopolis, Heraclides of Niciopolis [695] , Isaac of Cleopatris,
   Melas of Arsenoitis.

   In Heliopolis, Amos of Leontopolis, Ision of Athribis.

   In Pharbethus, Harpocration of Bubastus, Moses of PhacusÃ¦, Callinicus
   [696] of Pelusium, EudÃ¦mon of Tanis [697] , Ephraim of Thmuis.

   In Sais, HermÃ¦on of Cynopolis and Busiris, Soterichus of Sebennytus,
   Pininuthes of Phthenegys, Cronius of Metelis, Agathammon of the
   district of Alexandria.

   In Memphis, John who was ordered by the Emperor to be with the
   Archbishop [698] . These are those of Egypt.

   And the Clergy that he had in Alexandria were Apollonius Presbyter,
   IrenÃ¦us Presbyter, Dioscorus Presbyter, Tyrannus Presbyter. And
   Deacons; Timotheus Deacon, Antinous Deacon, HephÃ¦stion Deacon. And
   Macarius Presbyter of Parembole [699] .

   72. These Meletius presented actually in person [700] to the Bishop
   Alexander, but he made no mention of the person called Ischyras, nor
   ever professed at all that he had any Clergy in the Mareotis.
   Notwithstanding our enemies did not desist from their attempts, but
   still he that was no Presbyter was feigned to be one, for there was the
   Count ready to use compulsion towards us, and soldiers were hurrying us
   about. But even then the grace of God prevailed: for they could not
   convict Macarius in the matter of the cup; and Arsenius, whom they
   reported to have been murdered by me, stood before them alive and
   shewed the falseness of their accusation. When therefore they were
   unable to convict Macarius, Eusebius and his fellows, who became
   enraged that they had lost the prey of which they had been in pursuit,
   persuaded the Count Dionysius, who is one of them, to send to the
   Mareotis, in order to see whether they could not find out something
   there against the Presbyter, or rather that they might at a distance
   patch up their plot as they pleased in our absence: for this was their
   aim. However,--when we represented that the journey to the Mareotis was
   a superfluous undertaking (for that they ought not to pretend that
   statements were defective which they had been employed upon so long,
   and ought not now to defer the matter; for they had said whatever they
   thought they could say, and now being at a loss what to do, they were
   making pretences); or if they must needs go to the Mareotis, that at
   least the suspected parties should not be sent,--the Count was
   convinced by my reasoning, with respect to the suspected persons; but
   they did anything rather than what I proposed, for the very persons
   whom I objected against on account of the Arian heresy, these were they
   who promptly went off, viz. Diognius, Maris, Theodorus, Macedonius,
   Ursacius, and Valens. Again, letters were written to the Prefect of
   Egypt and a military guard was provided; and, what was remarkable and
   altogether most suspicious, they caused Macarius the accused party to
   remain behind under a guard of soldiers, while they took with them the
   accuser [701] . Now who after this does not see through this
   conspiracy? Who does not clearly perceive the wickedness of Eusebius
   and his fellows? For if a judicial enquiry must needs take place in the
   Mareotis, the accused also ought to have been sent thither. But if they
   did not go for the purpose of such an enquiry, why did they take the
   accuser? It was enough that he had not been able to prove the fact. But
   this they did in order that they might carry on their designs against
   the absent Presbyter, whom they could not convict when present, and
   might concoct a plan as they pleased. For when the Presbyters of
   Alexandria and of the whole district found fault with them because they
   were there by themselves, and required that they too might be present
   at their proceedings (for they said that they knew both the
   circumstances of the case, and the history of the person named
   Ischyras), they would not allow them; and although they had with them
   Philagrius the Prefect of Egypt [702] , who was an apostate, and
   heathen soldiers, during an enquiry which it was not becoming even for
   Catechumens to witness, they would not admit the Clergy, lest there as
   well as at Tyre there might be those who would expose them.

   73. But in spite of these precautions they were not able to escape
   detection: for the Presbyters of the City and of the Mareotis,
   perceiving their evil designs, addressed to them the following protest.

   To Theognius, Maris, Macedonius, Theodorus, Ursacius, and Valens, the
   Bishops who have come from Tyre, these from the Presbyters and Deacons
   of the Catholic Church of Alexandria under the most reverend Bishop
   Athanasius.

   It was incumbent upon you when you came hither and brought with you the
   accuser, to bring also the Presbyter Macarius; for trials are appointed
   by Holy Scripture to be so constituted, that the accuser and accused
   may stand up together. But since neither you brought Macarius, nor our
   most reverend Bishop Athanasius came hither with you, we claimed for
   ourselves the right of being present at the investigation, that we
   might see that the enquiry was conducted impartially, and might
   ourselves be convinced of the truth. But when you refused to allow
   this, and wished, in company only with the Prefect of Egypt and the
   accuser, to do whatever you pleased, we confess that we saw a suspicion
   of evil in the affair, and perceived that your coming was only the act
   of a cabal and a conspiracy. Wherefore we address to you this letter,
   to be a testimony before a genuine Council, that it may be known to all
   men, that you have carried on an ex parte proceeding and for your own
   ends, and have desired nothing else but to form a conspiracy against
   us. A copy of this, lest it should be kept secret by you, we have
   handed in to Palladius also the Controller [703] of Augustus. For what
   you have already done causes us to suspect you, and to reckon on the
   like conduct from you hereafter.

   I Dionysius Presbyter have handed in this letter. Alexander Presbyter,
   Nilaras Presbyter, Longus Presbyter, Aphthonius Presbyter, Athanasius
   Presbyter, Amyntius Presbyter, Pistus Presbyter, Plution Presbyter,
   Dioscorus Presbyter, Apollonius Presbyter, Sarapion Presbyter, Ammonius
   Presbyter, Gaius Presbyter, Rhinus Presbyter, Ã†thales Presbyter.

   Deacons; Marcellinus Deacon, Appianus Deacon, Theon Deacon, Timotheus
   Deacon, a second Timotheus Deacon.

   74. This is the letter, and these the names of the Clergy of the city;
   and the following was written by the Clergy of the Mareotis, who know
   the character of the accuser, and who were with me in my visitation.

   To the holy Council of blessed Bishops of the Catholic Church, all the
   Presbyters and Deacons of the Mareotis send health in the Lord.

   Knowing that which is written, Speak that thine eyes have seen,' and, A
   false witness shall not be unpunished [704] ', we testify what we have
   seen, especially since the conspiracy which has been formed against our
   Bishop Athanasius has made our testimony necessary. We wonder how
   Ischyras ever came to be reckoned among the number of the Ministers of
   the Church, which is the first point we think it necessary to mention.
   Ischyras never was a Minister of the Church; but when formerly he
   represented himself to be a Presbyter of Colluthus, he found no one to
   believe him, except only his own relations [705] . For he never had a
   Church, nor was ever considered a Clergyman by those who lived but a
   short distance from his village, except only, as we said before, by his
   own relations. But, notwithstanding he assumed this designation, he was
   deposed in the presence of our Father Hosius at the Council which
   assembled at Alexandria [706] , and was admitted to communion as a
   layman, and so he continued subsequently, having fallen from his
   falsely reputed rank of presbyter. Of his character we think it
   unnecessary to speak, as all men have it in their power to become
   acquainted therewith. But since he has falsely accused our Bishop
   Athanasius of breaking a cup and overturning a table, we are
   necessarily obliged to address you on this point. We have said already
   that he never had a Church in the Mareotis; and we declare before God
   as our witness, that no cup was broken, nor table overturned by our
   Bishop, nor by any one of those who accompanied him; but all that is
   alleged respecting this affair is mere calumny. And this we say, not as
   having been absent from the Bishop, for we are all with him when he
   makes his visitation of the Mareotis, and he never goes about alone,
   but is accompanied by all of us Presbyters and Deacons, and by a
   considerable number of the people. Wherefore we make these assertions
   as having been present with him in every visitation which he has made
   amongst us, and testify that neither was a cup ever broken, nor table
   overturned, but the whole story is false, as the accuser himself also
   witnesses under his own hand [707] . For when, after he had gone off
   with Meletians, and had reported these things against our Bishop
   Athanasius, he wished to be admitted to communion, he was not received,
   although he wrote and confessed under his own hand that none of these
   things were true, but that he had been suborned by certain persons to
   say so.

   75. Wherefore also Theognius, Theodorus, Maris, Macedonius, Ursacius,
   Valens, and their fellows came into the Mareotis, and when they found
   that none of these things were true, but it was likely to be discovered
   that they had framed a false accusation against our Bishop Athanasius,
   Theognius and his fellows being themselves his enemies, caused the
   relations of Ischyras and certain Arian madmen to say whatever they
   wished. For none of the people spoke against the Bishop; but these
   persons, through fear of Philagrius the Prefect of Egypt, and by
   threats and with the support of the Arian madmen, accomplished whatever
   they desired. For when we came to disprove the calumny, they would not
   permit us, but cast us out, while they admitted whom they pleased to a
   participation in their schemes, and concerted matters with them,
   influencing them by fear of the Prefect Philagrius. Through his means
   they prevented us from being present, that we might discover whether
   those who were suborned by them were members of the Church or Arian
   madmen. And you also, dearly beloved Fathers, know, as you teach us,
   that the testimony of enemies avails nothing. That what we say is the
   truth the handwriting [708] of Ischyras testifies, as do also the facts
   themselves, because when we were conscious that no such thing as was
   pretended had taken place, they took with them Philagrius, that through
   fear of the sword and by threats they might frame whatever plots they
   wished. These things we testify as in the presence of God; we make
   these assertions as knowing that there will be a judgment held by God;
   desiring indeed all of us to come to you, but being content with
   certain of our number, so that the letters may be instead of the
   presence of those who have not come.

   I, Ingenius Presbyter, pray you health in the Lord, beloved fathers.

   To Flavius Philagrius, and to Flavius Palladius, Ducenary [709] ,

   Commissary of Provisions, and Centenary of my lords the most
   illustrious Prefects of the sacred PrÃ¦torium, these from the Presbyters
   and Deacons of the Mareotis, a nome of the Catholic Church which is
   under the most Reverend Bishop Athanasius, we address this testimony by
   those whose names are underwritten:--

   Whereas Theognius, Maris, Macedonius, Theodorus, Ursacius, and Valens,
   as if sent by all the Bishops who assembled at Tyre, came into our
   Diocese alleging that they had received orders to investigate certain
   ecclesiastical affairs, among which they spoke of the breaking of a cup
   of the Lord, of which information was given them by Ischyras, whom they
   brought with them, and who says that he is a Presbyter, although he is
   not,--for he was ordained by the Presbyter Colluthus who pretended to
   the Episcopate, and was afterwards ordered by a whole Council, by
   Hosius and the Bishops that were with him, to take the place of a
   Presbyter, as he was before; and accordingly all that were ordained by
   Colluthus resumed the same rank which they held before, and so Ischyras
   himself proved to be a layman,--and the church which he says he has,
   never was a church at all, but a quite small private house belonging to
   an orphan boy of the name of Ision;--for this reason we have offered
   this testimony, adjuring you by Almighty God, and by our Lords
   Constantine Augustus, and the most illustrious CÃ¦sars his sons, to
   bring these things to the knowledge of their piety. For neither is he a
   Presbyter of the Catholic Church nor does he possess a church, nor has
   a cup ever been broken, but the whole story is false and an invention.

   Dated in the Consulship of Julius Constantius the most illustrious
   Patrician [710] , brother of the most religious Emperor Constantine
   Augustus, and of Rufinus Albinus, most illustrious men, on the tenth
   day of the month Thoth [711] .

   These were the letters of the Presbyters.

   77. The following also are the letters and protests of the Bishops who
   came with us to Tyre, when they became aware of the conspiracy and
   plot.

   To the Bishops assembled at Tyre, most honoured Lords, those of the
   Catholic Church who have come from Egypt with Athanasius send greeting
   in the Lord.

   We suppose that the conspiracy which has been formed against us by
   Eusebius, Theognius, Maris, Narcissus, Theodorus, Patrophilus, and
   their fellows is no longer uncertain. From the very beginning we all
   demurred, through our fellow-minister Athanasius, to the holding of the
   enquiry in their presence, knowing that the presence of even one enemy
   only, much more of many, is able to disturb and injure the hearing of a
   cause. And you also yourselves know the enmity which they entertain,
   not only towards us, but towards all the orthodox, how that for the
   sake of the madness of Arius, and his impious doctrine, they direct
   their assaults, they form conspiracies against all. And when, being
   confident in the truth, we desired to shew the falsehood, which the
   Meletians had employed against the Church, Eusebius and his fellows
   endeavoured by some means or other to interrupt our representations,
   and strove eagerly to set aside our testimony, threatening those who
   gave an honest judgment, and insulting others, for the sole purpose of
   carrying out the design they had against us. Your godly piety, most
   honoured Lords, was probably ignorant of their conspiracy, but we
   suppose that it has now been made manifest. For indeed they have
   themselves plainly disclosed it; for they desired to send to the
   Mareotis those of their party who are suspected by us, so that, while
   we were absent and remained here, they might disturb the people and
   accomplish what they wished. They knew that the Arian madmen, and
   Colluthians [712] and Meletians, were enemies of the Catholic Church
   and therefore they were anxious to send them, that in the presence of
   our enemies they might devise against us whatever schemes they pleased.
   And those of the Meletians who are here, even four days previously (as
   they knew that this enquiry was about to take place), despatched at
   evening certain of their party, as couriers, for the purpose of
   collecting Meletians out of Egypt into the Mareotis, because there were
   none at all there, and Colluthians and Arian madmen, from other parts,
   and to prepare them to speak against us. For you also know that
   Ischyras himself confessed before you, that he had not more than seven
   persons in his congregation. When therefore we heard that, after they
   had made what preparations they pleased against us, and had sent these
   suspected persons, they were going about to each of you, and requiring
   your subscriptions, in order that it might appear as if this had been
   done with the consent of you all; for this reason we hastened to write
   to you, and to present this our testimony; declaring that we are the
   objects of a conspiracy under which we are suffering by and through
   them, and demanding that having the fear of God in your minds, and
   condemning their conduct in sending whom they pleased without our
   consent, you would refuse your subscriptions, lest they pretend that
   those things are done by you, which they are contriving only among
   themselves. Surely it becomes those who are in Christ, not to regard
   human motives, but to prefer the truth before all things. And be not
   afraid of their threatenings, which they employ against all, nor of
   their plots, but rather fear God. If it was at all necessary that
   persons should be sent to the Mareotis, we also ought to have been
   there with them, in order that we might convict the enemies of the
   Church, and point out those who were aliens, and that the investigation
   of the matter might be impartial. For you know that Eusebius and his
   fellows contrived that a letter should be presented, as coming from the
   Collutians, the Meletians, and Arians, and directed against us: but it
   is evident that these enemies of the Catholic Church speak nothing that
   is true concerning us, but say everything against us. And the law of
   God forbids an enemy to be either a witness or a judge. Wherefore as
   you will have to give an account in the day of judgment, receive this
   testimony, and recognising the conspiracy which has been framed against
   us, beware, if you are requested by them, of doing anything against us,
   and of taking part in the designs of Eusebius and his fellows. For you
   know, as we said before, that they are our enemies, and you are aware
   why Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea became such last year [713] . We pray that you
   may be in health, greatly beloved Lords.

   78. To the most illustrious Count Flavius Dionysius, from the Bishops
   of the Catholic Church in Egypt who have come to Tyre.

   We suppose that the conspiracy which has been formed against us by
   Eusebius, Theognius, Maris, Narcissus, Theodorus, Patrophilus and their
   fellows, is no longer uncertain. From the very beginning we all
   demurred, through our fellow-minister Athanasius, to the holding of the
   enquiry in their presence, knowing that the presence of even one enemy
   only, much more of many, is able to disturb and injure the hearing of a
   cause. For their enmity is manifest which they entertain, not only
   towards us, but also towards all the orthodox, because they direct
   their assaults, they form conspiracies against all. And when, being
   confident in the truth, we desired to shew the falsehood which the
   Meletians had employed against the Church, Eusebius and his fellows
   endeavoured by some means or other to interrupt our representations,
   and strove eagerly to set aside our testimony, threatening those who
   gave an honest judgment and insulting others, for the sole purpose of
   carrying out the design they had against us. Your goodness was probably
   ignorant of the conspiracy which they have formed against us, but we
   suppose that it has now been made manifest. For indeed they have
   themselves plainly disclosed it; for they desired to send to the
   Mareotis those of their party who are suspected by us, so that, while
   we were absent and remained here, they might disturb the people and
   accomplish what they wished. They knew that Arian madmen, Colluthians,
   and Meletians were enemies of the Church, and therefore they were
   anxious to send them, that in the presence of our enemies, they might
   devise against us whatever schemes they pleased. And those of the
   Meletians who are here, even four days previously (as they knew that
   this enquiry was about to take place), despatched at evening two
   individuals of their own party, as couriers, for the purpose of
   collecting Meletians out of Egypt into the Mareotis, because there were
   none at all there, and Colluthians, and Arian madmen, from other parts,
   and to prepare them to speak against us. And your goodness knows that
   he himself confessed before you, that he had not more than seven
   persons in his congregation. When therefore we heard that, after they
   had made what preparations they pleased against us, and had sent these
   suspected persons, they were going about to each of the Bishops and
   requiring their subscriptions, in order that it might appear that this
   was done with the consent of them all; for this reason we hastened to
   refer the matter to your honour, and to present this our testimony,
   declaring that we are the objects of a conspiracy, under which we are
   suffering by and through them, and demanding of you that having in your
   mind the fear of God, and the pious commands of our most religious
   Emperor, you would no longer tolerate these persons, but condemn their
   conduct in sending whom they pleased without our consent.

   Another from the same.

   79. The Bishops of the Catholic Church who have come from Egypt to
   Tyre, to the most illustrious Count Flavius Dionysius.

   Perceiving that many conspiracies and plots are being formed against us
   through the machinations of Eusebius, Narcissus, Flacillus, Theognius,
   Maris, Theodorus, Patrophilus, and their fellows (against whom we
   wished at first to enter an objection, but were not permitted), we are
   constrained to have recourse to the present appeal. We observe also
   that great zeal is exerted in behalf of the Meletians, and that a plot
   is laid against the Catholic Church in Egypt in our persons. Wherefore
   we present this letter to you, beseeching you to bear in mind the
   Almighty Power of God, who defends the kingdom of our most religious
   and godly Emperor Constantine, and to reserve the hearing of the
   affairs which concern us for the most religious Emperor himself. For it
   is but reasonable, since you were commissioned by his Majesty, that you
   should reserve the matter for him upon our appealing to his piety. We
   can no longer endure to be the objects of the treacherous designs of
   the fore-mentioned Eusebius and his fellows, and therefore we demand
   that the case be reserved for the most religious and God-beloved
   Emperor, before whom we shall be able to set forth our own and the
   Church's just claims. And we are convinced that when his piety shall
   have heard our cause, he will not condemn us. Wherefore we again adjure
   you by Almighty God, and by our most religious Emperor, who, together
   with the children of his piety, has thus ever been victorious [714] and
   prosperous these many years, that you proceed no further, nor suffer
   yourselves to move at all in the Council in relation to our affairs,
   but reserve the hearing of them for his piety. We have likewise made
   the same representations to my Lords the orthodox Bishops.

   80. Alexander [715] , Bishop of Thessalonica, on receiving these
   letters, wrote to the Count Dionysius as follows.

   The Bishop Alexander to my master Dionysius.

   I see that a conspiracy has evidently been formed against Athanasius;
   for they have determined, I know not on what grounds, to send all those
   to whom he has objected, without giving any information to us, although
   it was agreed that we should consider together who ought to be sent.
   Take care therefore that nothing be done rashly (for they have come to
   me in great alarm, saying that the wild beasts have already roused
   themselves, and are going to rush upon them; for they had heard it
   reported, that John had sent certain [716] ), lest they be beforehand
   with us, and concoct what schemes they please. For you know that the
   Colluthians who are enemies of the Church, and the Arians, and
   Meletians, are all of them leagued together, and are able to work much
   evil. Consider therefore what is best to be done, lest some mischief
   arise, and we be subject to censure, as not having judged the matter
   fairly. Great suspicions are also entertained of these persons, lest,
   as being devoted to the Meletians, they should go through those
   Churches whose Bishops are here [717] , and raise an alarm amongst
   them, and so disorder the whole of Egypt. For they see that this is
   already taking place to a great extent.

   Accordingly the Count Dionysius wrote to Eusebius and his fellows as
   follows.

   81. This is what I have already mentioned to my lords, Flacillus [718]
   and his fellows, that Athanasius has come forward and complained that
   those very persons have been sent whom he objected to; and crying out
   that he has been wronged and deceived. Alexander the lord of my soul
   [719] has also written to me on the subject; and that you may perceive
   that what his Goodness has said is reasonable, I have subjoined his
   letter to be read by you. Remember also what I wrote to you before: I
   impressed upon your Goodness, my lords, that the persons who were sent
   ought to be commissioned by the general vote and decision of all. Take
   care therefore lest our proceedings fall under censure, and we give
   just grounds of blame to those who are disposed to find fault with us.
   For as the accuser's side ought not to suffer any oppression, so
   neither ought the defendant's. And I think that there is no slight
   ground of blame against us, when my lord Alexander evidently
   disapproves of what we have done.

   82. While matters were proceeding thus we withdrew from them, as from
   an assembly of treacherous men [720] , for whatsoever they pleased they
   did, whereas there is no man in the world but knows that ex parte
   proceedings cannot stand good. This the divine law determines; for when
   the blessed Apostle was suffering under a similar conspiracy and was
   brought to trial, he demanded, saying, The Jews from Asia ought to have
   been here before thee, and object, if they had aught against me [721]
   .' On which occasion Festus also, when the Jews wished to lay such a
   plot against him, as these men have now laid against me, said, It is
   not the manner of Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he
   which is accused have the accuser face to face, and have licence to
   answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him [722] .' But
   Eusebius and his fellows both had the boldness to pervert the law, and
   have proved more unjust even than those wrong-doers. For they did not
   proceed privately at the first, but when in consequence of our being
   present they found themselves weak, then they straightway went out,
   like the Jews, and took counsel together alone, how they might destroy
   us and bring in their heresy, as those others demanded Barabbas. For
   this purpose it was, as they have themselves confessed, that they did
   all these things.

   83. Although these circumstances were amply sufficient for our
   vindication, yet in order that the wickedness of these men and the
   freedom of the truth might be more fully exhibited, I have not felt
   averse to repeat them again, in order to shew that they have acted in a
   manner inconsistently with themselves, and as men scheming in the dark
   have fallen foul of their own friends, and while they desired to
   destroy us have like insane persons wounded themselves. For in their
   investigation of the subject of the Mysteries, they questioned Jews,
   they examined Catechumens [723] ; Where were you,' they said, when
   Macarius came and overturned the Table?' They answered, We were
   within;' whereas there could be no oblation if Catechumens were
   present. Again, although they had written word everywhere, that
   Macarius came and overthrew everything, while the Presbyter was
   standing and celebrating the Mysteries, yet when they questioned
   whomsoever they pleased, and asked them, Where was Ischyras when
   Macarius rushed in?' those persons answered that he was lying sick in a
   cell. Well, then, he that was lying was not standing, nor was he that
   lay sick in his cell offering the oblation. Besides whereas Ischyras
   said that certain books had been burnt by Macarius, they who were
   suborned to give evidence, declared that nothing of the kind had been
   done, but that Ischyras spoke falsely. And what is most remarkable,
   although they had again written word everywhere, that those who were
   able to give evidence had been concealed by us, yet these persons made
   their appearance, and they questioned them, and were not ashamed when
   they saw it proved on all sides that they were slanderers, and were
   acting in this matter clandestinely, and according to their pleasure.
   For they prompted the witnesses by signs, while the Prefect threatened
   them, and the soldiers pricked them with their swords; but the Lord
   revealed the truth, and shewed them to be slanderers. Therefore also
   they concealed the minutes of their proceedings, which they retained
   themselves, and charged those who wrote them to put out of sight, and
   to commit to no one whomsoever. But in this also they were
   disappointed; for the person who wrote them was Rufus, who is now
   public executioner in the Augustalian [724] prefecture, and is able to
   testify to the truth of this; and Eusebius and his fellows sent them to
   Rome by the hands of their own friends, and Julius the Bishop
   transmitted them to me. And now they are mad, because we obtained and
   read what they wished to conceal.

   84. As such was the character of their machinations, so they very soon
   shewed plainly the reasons of their conduct. For when they went away,
   they took the Arians with them to Jerusalem, and there admitted them to
   communion, having sent out a letter concerning them, part [725] of
   which, and the beginning, is as follows.

   The holy Council by the grace of God assembled at Jerusalem, to the
   Church of God which is in Alexandria, and to the Bishops, Presbyters,
   and Deacons, in all Egypt, the Thebais, Libya, Pentapolis, and
   throughout the world, sends health in the Lord.

   Having come together out of different Provinces to a great meeting
   which we have held for the consecration of the Martyry [726] of the
   Saviour, which has been appointed to the service of God the King of all
   and of His Christ, by the zeal of our most God-beloved Emperor
   Constantine, the grace of God hath afforded us more abundant rejoicing
   of heart; which our most God-beloved Emperor himself hath occasioned us
   by his letters, wherein he hath stirred us up to do that which is
   right, putting away all envy from the Church of God, and driving far
   from us all malice, by which the members of God have been heretofore
   torn asunder, and that we should with simple and peaceable minds
   receive Arius and his fellows, whom envy, that enemy of all goodness,
   has caused for a season to be excluded from the Church. Our most
   religious Emperor has also in his letter testified to the correctness
   of their faith, which he has ascertained from themselves, himself
   receiving the profession of it from them by word of mouth, and has now
   made manifest to us by subjoining to his own letters the men's orthodox
   opinion in writing.

   85. Every one that hears of these things must see through their
   treachery. For they made no concealment of what they were doing; unless
   perhaps they confessed the truth without wishing it. For if I was the
   hindrance to the admittance of Arius and his fellows into the Church,
   and if they were received while I was suffering from their plots, what
   other conclusion can be arrived at, than that these things were done on
   their account, and that all their proceedings against me, and the story
   which they fabricated about the breaking of the cup and the murder of
   Arsenius, were for the sole purpose of introducing impiety into the
   Church, and of preventing their being condemned as heretics? For this
   was what the Emperor threatened formerly in his letters to me. And they
   were not ashamed to write in the manner they did, and to affirm that
   those persons whom the whole Ecumenical Council anathematized held
   orthodox sentiments. And as they undertook to say and do anything
   without scruple, so they were not afraid to meet together in a corner,'
   in order to overthrow, as far as was in their power, the authority of
   so great a Council.

   Moreover, the price which they paid for false testimony yet more fully
   manifests their wickedness and impious intentions. The Mareotis, as I
   have already said, is a country district of Alexandria, in which there
   has never been either a Bishop or a Chorepiscopus [727] ; but the
   Churches of the whole district are subject to the Bishop of Alexandria,
   and each Presbyter has under his charge one of the largest villages,
   which are about ten or more in number [728] . Now the village in which
   Ischyras lives is a very small one, and possesses so few inhabitants,
   that there has never been a church built there, but only in the
   adjoining village. Nevertheless, they determined, contrary to ancient
   usage [729] , to nominate a Bishop for this place, and not only so, but
   even to appoint one, who was not so much as a Presbyter. Knowing as
   they did the unusual nature of such a proceeding, yet being constrained
   by the promises they had given in return for his false impeachment of
   me, they submitted even to this, lest that abandoned person, if he were
   ungratefully treated by them, should disclose the truth, and thereby
   shew the wickedness of Eusebius and his fellows. Notwithstanding this
   he has no church, nor a people to obey him, but is scouted by them all,
   like a dog [730] , although they have even caused the Emperor to write
   to the Receiver-General (for everything is in their power), commanding
   that a church should be built for him, that being possessed of that,
   his statement may appear credible about the cup and the table. They
   caused him immediately to be nominated a Bishop also, because if he
   were without a church, and not even a Presbyter, he would appear to be
   a false accuser, and a fabricator of the whole matter. At any rate he
   has no people, and even his own relations are not obedient to him, and
   as the name which he retains is an empty one, so also the following
   letter is ineffectual, which he keeps, making a display of it as an
   exposure of the utter wickedness of himself and of Eusebius and his
   fellows.

   The Letter of the Receiver-General. [731]

   Flavius Hemerius sends health to the Tax-collector of the Mareotis.

   Ischyras the Presbyter having petitioned the piety of our Lords,
   Augusti and CÃ¦sars, that a Church might be built in the district of
   Irene, belonging to Secontarurus [732] , their divinity has commanded
   that this should be done as soon as possible. Take care therefore, as
   soon as you receive the copy of the sacred Edict, which with all due
   veneration is placed above, and the Reports which have been formed
   before my devotion, that you quickly make an abstract of them, and
   transfer them to the Order book, so that the sacred command may be put
   in execution.

   86. While they were thus plotting and scheming, I went up [733] and
   represented to the Emperor the unjust conduct of Eusebius and his
   fellows, for he it was who had commanded the Council to be held, and
   his Count presided at it. When he heard my report, he was greatly
   moved, and wrote to them as follows.

   Constantine, Victor [734] , Maximus, Augustus, to the Bishops assembled
   at Tyre.

   I know not what the decisions are which you have arrived at in your
   Council amidst noise and tumult: but somehow the truth seems to have
   been perverted in consequence of certain confusions and disorders, in
   that you, through your mutual contentiousness, which you are resolved
   should prevail, have failed to perceive what is pleasing to God.
   However, it will rest with Divine Providence to disperse the mischiefs
   which manifestly are found to arise from this contentious spirit, and
   to shew plainly to us, whether you, while assembled in that place, have
   had any regard for the truth, and whether you have made your decisions
   uninfluenced by either favour or enmity. Wherefore I wish you all to
   assemble with all speed before my piety in order that you may render in
   person a true account of your proceedings.

   The reason why I have thought good to write thus to you, and why I
   summon you before me by letter, you will learn from what I am going to
   say. As I was entering on a late occasion our all-happy home of
   Constantinople, which bears our name (I chanced at the time to be on
   horseback), on a sudden the Bishop Athanasius, with certain others whom
   he had with him, approached me in the middle of the road, so
   unexpectedly, as to occasion me much amazement. God, who knoweth all
   things, is my witness, that I should have been unable at first sight
   even to recognise him, had not some of my attendants, on my naturally
   inquiring of them, informed me both who it was, and under what
   injustice he was suffering. I did not however enter into any
   conversation with him at that time, nor grant him an interview; but
   when he requested to be heard I was refusing, and all but gave orders
   for his removal; when with increasing boldness he claimed only this
   favour, that you should be summoned to appear, that he might have an
   opportunity of complaining before me in your presence, of the
   ill-treatment he has met with. As this appeared to me to be a
   reasonable request, and suitable to the times, I willingly ordered this
   letter to be written to you, in order that all of you, who constituted
   the Council which was held at Tyre, might hasten without delay to the
   Court [735] of my clemency, so as to prove by facts that you had passed
   an impartial and uncorrupt judgment. This, I say, you must do before
   me, whom not even you will deny to be a true servant of God.

   For indeed through my devotion to God, peace is preserved everywhere,
   and the Name of God is truly worshipped even by the barbarians, who
   have hitherto been ignorant of the truth. And it is manifest, that he
   who is ignorant of the truth, does not know God either. Nevertheless,
   as I said before, even the barbarians have now come to the knowledge of
   God, by means of me, His true servant [736] , and have learned to fear
   Him Whom they perceive from actual facts to be my shield and protector
   everywhere. And from this chiefly they have come to know God, Whom they
   fear through the dread which they have of me. But we, who are supposed
   to set forth (for I will not say to guard) the holy mysteries of His
   Goodness, we, I say, engage in nothing but what tends to dissension and
   hatred, and, in short, whatever contributes to the destruction of
   mankind. But hasten, as I said before, and all of you with all speed
   come to us, being persuaded that I shall endeavour with all my might to
   amend what is amiss, so that those things specially may be preserved
   and firmly established in the law of God, to which no blame nor
   dishonour may attach; while the enemies of the law, who under pretence
   of His holy Name bring in manifold and divers blasphemies, shall be
   scattered abroad, and entirely crushed, and utterly destroyed.

   87. When Eusebius and his fellows read this letter, being conscious of
   what they had done, they prevented the rest of the Bishops from going
   up, and only themselves went, viz. Eusebius, Theognius, Patrophilus,
   the other Eusebius, Ursacius, and Valens. And they no longer said
   anything about the cup and Arsenius (for they had not the boldness to
   do so), but inventing another accusation which concerned the Emperor
   himself, they declared before him, that Athanasius had threatened that
   he would cause the corn to be withheld which was sent from Alexandria
   to his own home [737] . The Bishops Adamantius, Anubion, Agathammon,
   Arbethion, and Peter, were present and heard this. It was proved also
   by the anger of the Emperor; for although he had written the preceding
   letter, and had condemned their injustice, as soon as he heard such a
   charge as this, he was immediately incensed, and instead of granting me
   a hearing, he sent me away into Gaul. And this again shews their
   wickedness further; for when the younger Constantine, of blessed
   memory, sent me back home, remembering what his father had written
   [738] , he also wrote as follows.

   Constantine CÃ¦sar, to the people of the Catholic Church of the city of
   Alexandria.

   I suppose that it has not escaped the knowledge of your pious minds,
   that Athanasius, the interpreter of the adorable Law, was sent away
   into Gaul for a time, with the intent that, as the savageness of his
   bloodthirsty and inveterate enemies persecuted him to the hazard of his
   sacred life, he might thus escape suffering some irremediable calamity,
   through the perverse dealing of those evil men. In order therefore to
   escape this, he was snatched out of the jaws of his assailants, and was
   ordered to pass some time under my government, and so was supplied
   abundantly with all necessaries in this city, where he lived, although
   indeed his celebrated virtue, relying entirely on divine assistance,
   sets at nought the sufferings of adverse fortune. Now seeing that it
   was the fixed intention of our master Constantine Augustus, my Father,
   to restore the said Bishop to his own place, and to your most beloved
   piety, but he was taken away by that fate which is common to all men,
   and went to his rest before he could accomplish his wish; I have
   thought proper to fulfil that intention of the Emperor of sacred memory
   which I have inherited from him. When he comes to present himself
   before you, you will learn with what reverence he has been treated.
   Indeed it is not wonderful, whatever I have done on his behalf; for the
   thoughts of your longing desire for him, and the appearance of so great
   a man, moved my soul, and urged me thereto. May Divine Providence
   continually preserve you, beloved brethren.

   Dated from Treveri the 15th before the Calends of July [739] .

   88. This being the reason why I was sent away into Gaul, who, I ask
   again, does not plainly perceive the intention of the Emperor, and the
   murderous spirit of Eusebius and his fellows, and that the Emperor had
   done this in order to prevent their forming some more desperate scheme?
   for he listened to them in simplicity [740] . Such were the practices
   of Eusebius and his fellows, and such their machinations against me.
   Who that has witnessed them will deny that nothing has been done in my
   favour out of partiality, but that that great number of Bishops both
   individually and collectively wrote as they did in my behalf and
   condemned the falsehood of my enemies justly, and in accordance with
   the truth? Who that has observed such proceedings as these will deny
   that Valens and Ursacius had good reason to condemn themselves, and to
   write [741] as they did, to accuse themselves when they repented,
   choosing rather to suffer shame for a short time, than to undergo the
   punishment of false accusers for ever and ever [742] ?

   89. Wherefore also my blessed fellow-ministers, acting justly and
   according to the laws of the Church, while certain affirmed that my
   case was doubtful, and endeavoured to compel them to annul the sentence
   which was passed in my favour, have now endured all manner of
   sufferings, and have chosen rather to be banished than to see the
   judgment of so many Bishops reversed. Now if those genuine Bishops had
   withstood by words only those who plotted against me, and wished to
   undo all that had been done in my behalf; or if they had been ordinary
   men, and not the Bishops of illustrious cities, and the heads of great
   Churches, there would have been room to suspect that in this instance
   they too had acted contentiously and in order to gratify me. But when
   they not only endeavoured to convince by argument, but also endured
   banishment, and one of them is Liberius, Bishop of Rome, (for although
   he did not endure [743] to the end the sufferings of banishment, yet he
   remained in his exile for two years, being aware of conspiracy formed
   against us), and since there is also the great Hosius, together with
   the Bishops of Italy, and of Gaul, and others from Spain, and from
   Egypt, and Libya, and all those from Pentapolis (for although for a
   little while, through fear of the threats of Constantius, he seemed not
   to resist them [744] yet the great violence and tyrannical power
   exercised by Constantius, and the many insults and stripes inflicted
   upon him, proved that it was not because he gave up my cause, but
   through the weakness of old age, being unable to bear the stripes, that
   he yielded to them for a season), therefore I say, it is altogether
   right that all, as being fully convinced, should hate and abominate the
   injustice and the violence which they have used towards me; especially
   as it is well known that I have suffered these things on account of
   nothing else but the Arian impiety.

   90. Now if anyone wishes to become acquainted with my case, and the
   falsehood of Eusebius and his fellows, let him read what has been
   written in my behalf, and let him hear the witnesses, not one, or two,
   or three, but that great number of Bishops; and again let him attend to
   the witnesses of these proceedings, Liberius and Hosius, and their
   fellows, who when they saw the attempts made against us, chose rather
   to endure all manner of sufferings than to give up the truth, and the
   judgment which had been pronounced in our favour. And this they did
   with an honourable and righteous intention, for what they suffered
   proves to what straits the other Bishops were reduced. And they are
   memorials and records against the Arian heresy, and the wickedness of
   false accusers, and afford a pattern and model for those who come
   after, to contend for the truth unto death [745] , and to abominate the
   Arian heresy which fights against Christ, and is a forerunner of
   Antichrist, and not to believe those who attempt to speak against me.
   For the defence put forth, and the sentence given, by so many Bishops
   of high character, are a trustworthy and sufficient testimony in our
   behalf.

   List of Bishops Present at Sardica.

   The materials for an authentic list are (1) the names given by
   Athanasius, Apol. c. Ar. 50, previous to the lists of bishops from
   various provinces who signed the letter of the council when in
   circulation. These names, given with no specification of their sees,
   are 77 in number. (2) The list of signatures to the letter of the
   council to Julius, given by Hilary, Fragm. ii., 59 in number. The
   signatures to the letters discovered by Maffei and printed in Migne,
   Patr. Gr. xxvi. 1331, sqq. Of these, 26 sign (3) the council's letter
   to the Mareotic Churches, and 61, in part the same, sign (4) the letter
   of Athanasius to the same (Letter 46 in this volume). These signatures
   comprise 30 names not given by Hilary, while those in (1) add six which
   are absent from (2) and (3) alike. This raises the total to 95. We add
   (5) Gratus of Carthage, present according to the Greek text of the
   Canons, although he afterward signed the letter in a local council of
   his own, like Maximin of Treveri, Verissimus of Lyons, and Arius of
   Palestine, who are therefore given by Athanasius in his second list
   (the former two being omitted from the first): also Euphrates of
   Cologne, who was sent by Constans to Antioch with the council's
   decisions (Prolegg. ch. ii. Â§6), and was therefore most likely present
   at the council itself. We thus get 97 in all.

   This total is confirmed if we subtract from the 170 more or less' of
   Hist. Arian. 15 the 76 seceders to Philippopolis (Sabinus in Socr. ii.
   16), 73 of whom sign their letter, given by Hilary. This leaves 94 more
   or less,' so that the list now to be given, in elucidation of that of
   Athanasius, has strong claims to rank as approximately correct. The
   numbers after the names refer to the sources (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) specified
   above. 1. Adolius (1), See unknown; 2. Aetius (1, 3), Thessalonica in
   Macedonia; 3. Alexander (1, 4), Cypara (i.e. Cyparissus?) in Achaia; 4.

   whose work (in Leonis M. Opp. vol. iii. pp. xlii. sqq.) our list is
   founded. In some cases the names of the see are clearly corrupt beyond
   all recognition. The signatures appended to the canons in the
   collections of councils, are taken (with certain uncritical
   adaptations) from the Hilarian list, with the addition, in some copies,
   of Alexander (3 supra), whose name, therefore, has probably dropped out
   of the Hilarian text in course of transmission.]

   Introduction to de Decretis or Defence of the Nicene Definition.

   ------------------------

   This letter must have been written in the interval between the return
   of Athanasius in 346 and his flight in 356. Acacius was already (Â§3)
   Bishop of CÃ¦sarea 339; Eusebius of Nicomedia is not referred to as
   though still living (he died 342). Moreover the language of Â§2 ("for in
   no long time they will turn to outrage," &c.) implies a period of
   actual peace, but with a prospect of the repetition of the scenes of
   the year 339. This actually occurred in 356. Accordingly we must
   probably place the tract under the sole reign of Constantius, between
   351 and the end of 355.

   It is written in answer to a friend who in disputing with Arians had
   been posed by their objection to the use of non-scriptural terms in the
   Nicene Definition. He accordingly asks for some account of what the
   council had done.

   Athanasius begins his answer by stigmatising the evasions and
   inconsistency of the Arianisers, and describing their conduct at the
   council, and how they eventually subscribed to the terms now complained
   of (1-5). He then investigates the meaning of the divine Sonship
   (6-14), and how its true meaning is brought out by the other titles of
   the Son (15-17). Coming to the non-scriptural expressions he shews how
   they were forced upon the council by the evasions of the Arians
   (18-20), and that they express no sense not to be found in Scripture
   (21-24). Moreover, they had already been in use in the Church, as is
   shewn by extracts from Theognostus, the two Dionysii, and Origen
   (25-27). Lastly (28-32) he discusses the term agenetos, applied by the
   Arians (especially Asterius) to the Father, in contrast, not to the
   creation, but to the Son, who is thereby implied to be genetos. He
   insists on Father' not agenetos' as the divine title authorised by
   Scripture. Lastly he appends, in proof of what he states in Â§3, the
   letter of Eusebius to the people of CÃ¦sarea, containing the creed of
   the council, which, for reasons there stated, we have inserted above,
   pp. 73-76.

   The interest of the letter is principally threefold; first on account
   of its notice of the proceedings at NicÃ¦a (cf. ad Afr. 5), one of the
   few primary sources of our knowledge of what took place there:
   secondly, on account of its fragments of early writers, especially the
   Dionysii, of whom more will be said in the introduction to the next
   tract. With regard to Theognostus, the quotations in this tract and in
   Serap. iv. 9 are important in view of the somewhat damaging accounts of
   his teaching in the few other writers (Gregory of Nyssa, Photius) who
   mention him.

   Thirdly, the term agenetos demands attention. It is impossible to give
   its exact force in idiomatic English: the rendering Ingenerate' adopted
   by Newman is perhaps the most unfortunate one imaginable. Uncreated,' a
   possible substitute, is also open to objection, firstly, as not
   distinguishing the word from the derivatives of ktizein, poiein,
   demiourgein, secondly, as giving it a passive sense, which does not
   inherently attach to it. For lack of a better word, Unoriginate' may
   perhaps be adopted. That which has not (or cannot) come to be,' that
   which is not the result of a process,'--is what the word strictly
   signifies'--das Ungewordene.' It was therefore strictly applicable to
   the Son as well as to the Father. But throughout the earlier stages of
   the Arian controversy the question was embarrassed by the homophones
   gennetos and agennetos, generate or begotten, and unbegotten. The
   confusion of thought due to the resemblance of sound is reflected in
   the confusion of readings in the mss. Athanasius himself (Orat. i. 56)
   perceives the distinctive sense of agennetos. In the present tract and
   in Orat. i. 30, he has agenetos only in view, the idea of begetting
   being absent. Here (and cf. de Syn. 46, note 5) he is denying that the
   Father is alone agenetos, uncreated or without a becoming.' Accordingly
   although the word gennethenta was consecrated and safeguarded in the
   Creed of NicÃ¦a (Begotten not made), and although the distinctness of
   the derivatives of the two verbs was felt by Athanasius, and pointed
   out by others (Epiph. HÃ¦r. 64, 8), the use of either group of words was
   avoided by Catholics as dangerous. A clear distinction of the words and
   of their respective applicability is made by John Damascene Fid. Orth.
   I. viii. (see Lightfoot, Ignat. vol. 2, excursus on Eph. Â§7, Thilo, ubi
   supra, Introd. p. 14, and Harnack, Dg. 2, p. 193 note).

   De Decretis or Defence of the Nicene Definition

   ------------------------

   Chapter I.--Introduction. The complaint of the Arians against the
   Nicene Council; their fickleness; they are like Jews; their employment
   of force instead of reason.

   1. Thou hast done well, in signifying to me the discussion thou hast
   had with the advocates of Arianism, among whom were certain of the
   friends of Eusebius, as well as very many of the brethren who hold the
   doctrine of the Church. I hailed thy vigilance for the love of Christ,
   which excellently exposed the irreligion [746] of their heresy; while I
   marvelled at the effrontery which led the Arians, after all the past
   detection of unsoundness and futility in their arguments, nay, after
   the general conviction of their extreme perverseness, still to complain
   like the Jews, "Why did the Fathers at NicÃ¦a use terms not in Scripture
   [747] , Of the essence' and One in essence?'" Thou then, as a man of
   learning, in spite of their subterfuges, didst convict them of talking
   to no purpose; and they in devising them were but acting suitably to
   their own evil disposition. For they are as variable and fickle in
   their sentiments, as chameleons in their colours [748] ; and when
   exposed they look confused, and when questioned they hesitate, and then
   they lose shame, and betake themselves to evasions. And then, when
   detected in these, they do not rest till they invent fresh matters
   which are not, and, according to the Scripture, imagine a vain thing
   [749] '; and all that they may be constant to their irreligion.

   Now such endeavours [750] are nothing else than an obvious token of
   their defect of reason [751] , and a copying, as I have said, of Jewish
   malignity. For the Jews too, when convicted by the Truth, and unable to
   confront it, used evasions, such as, What sign doest Thou, that we may
   see and believe Thee? What dost Thou work [752] ? though so many signs
   were given, that they said themselves, What do we? for this man doeth
   many miracles [753] .' In truth, dead men were raised, lame walked,
   blind saw afresh, lepers were cleansed, and the water became wine, and
   five loaves satisfied five thousand, and all wondered and worshipped
   the Lord, confessing that in Him were fulfilled the prophecies, and
   that He was God the Son of God; all but the Pharisees, who, though the
   signs shone brighter than the sun, yet complained still, as ignorant
   men, Why dost Thou, being a man, make Thyself God [754] ?' Insensate,
   and verily blind in understanding! they ought contrariwise to have
   said, "Why hast Thou, being God, become man?" for His works proved Him
   God, that they might both worship the goodness of the Father, and
   admire the Son's Economy for our sakes. However, this they did not say;
   no, nor liked to witness what He was doing; or they witnessed indeed,
   for this they could not help, but they changed their ground of
   complaint again, "Why healest Thou the paralytic, why makest Thou the
   born-blind to see, on the sabbath day?" But this too was an excuse, and
   mere murmuring; for on other days as well did the Lord heal all manner
   of sickness, and all manner of disease [755] ,' but they complained
   still according to their wont, and by calling Him Beelzebub, preferred
   the suspicion of Atheism [756] , to a recantation of their own
   wickedness. And though in such sundry times and divers manners the
   Saviour shewed His Godhead and preached the Father to all men,
   nevertheless, as kicking against the pricks, they contradicted in the
   language of folly, and this they did, according to the divine proverb,
   that by finding occasions, they might separate themselves from the
   truth [757] .

   2. As then the Jews of that day, for acting thus wickedly and denying
   the Lord, were with justice deprived of their laws and of the promise
   made to their fathers, so the Arians, Judaizing now, are, in my
   judgment, in circumstances like those of Caiaphas and the contemporary
   Pharisees. For, perceiving that their heresy is utterly unreasonable,
   they invent excuses, "Why was this defined, and not that?" Yet wonder
   not if now they practise thus; for in no long time they will turn to
   outrage, and next will threaten the band and the captain [758] .'
   Forsooth in these their heterodoxy has its support, as we see; for
   denying the Word of God, reason have they none at all, as is equitable.
   Aware then of this, I would have made no reply to their interrogations:
   but, since thy friendliness [759] has asked to know the transactions of
   the Council, I have without any delay related at once what then took
   place, shewing in few words, how destitute Arianism is of a religious
   spirit, and how their one business is to frame evasions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [746] eusebeia, asebeia, &c., here translated "religion, irreligion,
   religious, &c. &c." are technical words throughout, being taken from S.
   Paul's text, "Great is the mystery of godliness," eusebeias, i.e.
   orthodoxy. Such too seems to be the meaning of "godly admonitions," and
   "godly judgments," and "this godly and well-learned man," in our
   Ordination Services. The Latin translation is "pius," "pietas." It
   might be in some respects suitably rendered by "devout" and its
   derivatives. On its familiar use in the controversy depends the
   blasphemous jest of Eudoxius, Arian Bishop of Constantinople, which was
   received with loud laughter in the Cathedral, and remained in esteem
   down to Socrates' day, "The Father is asebes, as being without
   devotion, the Son eusebes, devout, as paying devotion to the Father."
   Socr. Hist. ii. 43. Hence Arius ends his Letter to Eusebius with
   alethos eusebie. Theod. Hist. i. 4.

   [747] It appears that the Arians did not venture to speak
   disrespectfully of the definition of the Council till the date (a.d.
   352) of this work, when Acacius headed them. Yet the plea here used,
   the unscriptural character of its symbol, had been suggested to
   Constantius on his accession, a.d. 337, by the Arian priest, the
   favourite of Constantia, to whom Constantine had entrusted his will,
   Theod. Hist. ii. 3; and Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea glances at it, at the time
   of the Council, in the letter to his Church, which is subjoined to this
   Treatise.

   [748] Alexander also calls them chameleons, Socr. i. 6. p. 12.
   Athanasius so calls the Meletians, Hist. Arian. Â§79. Cyril compares
   them to "the leopard which cannot change his spots." Dial. ii. init. t.
   v. i. Aub., Naz. Or. 28. 2. On the fickleness of the Arians, vid.
   infra, Â§4. &c. Orat. ii. 40. He says, ad Ep. Ã†g. 6. that they
   considered Creeds as yearly covenants; and de Synod. Â§3. 4. as State
   Edicts. vid. also Â§14. and passim. "What wonder that they fight against
   their fathers, when they fight against themselves?" Â§37.

   [749] Ps. ii. 1.

   [750] epicheirema. and so Orat. i. Â§44. init. but infra. Â§25.
   epicheiremata means more definitely reasonings or argumentations.

   [751] alogias; an allusion frequent in Athanasius, to the judicial
   consequence of their denying the Word of God. Thus, just below, n. 3.
   "Denying the Word" or Reason "of God, reason have they none." Also
   Orat. i. Â§35. fin. Â§40. init. Â§62. Orat. ii. Â§7. init. Hence he so
   often calls the Arians "mad" and "deranged;" e.g. "not aware how mad'
   their reason' is." Orat. i. Â§37.

   [752] John vi. 30.

   [753] Ib. xi. 47.

   [754] Ib. x. 33.

   [755] Matt. iv. 23.

   [756] Or ungodliness, atheotetos. Thus Aetius was called ho atheos, the
   ungodly. de Synod. Â§6; and Arius complains that Alexander had expelled
   him and his from Alexandria, hos anthropous atheous. Theodor. Hist. i.
   4. "Atheism" and "Atheist" imply intention, system, and profession, and
   are so far too strong a rendering of the Greek. Since Christ was God,
   to deny Him was to deny God. The force of the term, however, seems to
   be, that, whereas the Son had revealed the "unknown God," and destroyed
   the reign of idols, the denial of the Son was bringing back idolatry
   and its attendant spiritual ignorance. Thus contr. Gent. Â§29. fin. he
   speaks of "the Greek idolatry as full of all Atheism" or ungodliness,
   and contrasts with it the knowledge of "the Guide and Framer of the
   Universe, the Father's Word," "that through Him we may discern His
   Father,' and the Greeks may know how far they have separated themselves
   from the truth.'" And Orat. ii. 43. he classes Arians with the Greeks,
   who "though they have the name of God in their mouths, incur the charge
   of Atheism,' because they know not the real and true God, the Father of
   our Lord Jesus Christ.'" (vid. also Basil in Eunom. ii. 22.) Shortly
   afterwards he gives a further reason for the title, observing that
   Arianism was worse than previous heresies, such as Manicheism, inasmuch
   as the latter denied the Incarnation, but Arianism tore from God's
   substance His connatural Word, and, as far as its words went, infringed
   upon the perfections and being of the first Cause. And so ad Ep. Ã†g.
   Â§17. fin. he says, that it alone, beyond other heresies, "has been bold
   against the Godhead Itself in a mad way (manikoteron, vid. foregoing
   note), denying that there is a Word, and that the Father was always
   Father." Elsewhere he speaks more generally, as if Arianism introduced
   "an Atheism or rather Judaism against the Scriptures,' being next door
   to Heathenism, so that its disciple cannot be even named Christian; for
   all such tenets are contrary to the Scriptures;'" and he makes this the
   reason why the Nicene Fathers stopped their ears and condemned it. ad
   Ep. Ã†g. Â§13. For the same reason he calls the heathen atheoi,
   atheistical or ungodly, "who are arraigned of irreligion by Divine
   Scripture." contr. Gent. Â§14. vid. eidolon atheoteta. Â§46. init.
   Moreover, he calls the Arian persecution worse than the pagan
   cruelties,' and therefore "a Babylonian Atheism," Ep. Encycl. Â§5. as
   not allowing the Catholics the use of prayer and baptism, with a
   reference to Dan. vi. 11, &c. Thus too he calls Constantius atheist,
   for his treatment of Hosius; oute ton theon phobetheis ho atheos. Hist.
   Arian. 45. Another reason for the title seems to have lain in the
   idolatrous character of Arian worship on its own shewing,' viz. as
   worshipping One whom they yet maintained to be a creature. [Prolegg.
   ch. ii. Â§3 (2)a, sub. fin.]

   [757] A reference to Prov. xviii. 1. which runs in the LXX. "a man
   seeketh occasions, when desirous of separating himself from friends."

   [758] Apparently an allusion to Joh. xviii. 12. Elsewhere, he speaks of
   "the chief captain" and "the governor," with an allusion to Acts xxiii.
   22-24. &c. Hist. Arian. Â§66. fin. vid. also Â§2. Apol. contr. Arian. Â§8.
   also Â§10. and 45. Orat. ii. Â§43. Ep. Encycl. Â§5. Against the use of
   violence in religion, vid. Hist. Arian. Â§33. 67. (Hil. ad Const. 1. 2.)
   On the other hand, he observes, that at NicÃ¦a, "it was not necessity
   which drove the judges to" their decision, "but all vindicated the
   Truth from deliberate purpose." ad Ep. Ã†g. 13.

   [759] diathesis. vid. also Hist. Arian. Â§45. Orat. ii. Â§4. where Parker
   maintains without reason that it should be translated, "external
   condition." vid. also Theod. Hist. i. 4. init.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter II.--Conduct of the Arians towards the Nicene Council. Ignorant
   as well as irreligious to attempt to reverse an Ecumenical Council:
   proceedings at NicÃ¦a: Eusebians then signed what they now complain of:
   on the unanimity of true teachers and the process of tradition: changes
   of the Arians.

   And do thou, beloved, consider whether it be not so. If, the devil
   having sowed their hearts with this perverseness [760] , they feel
   confidence in their bad inventions, let them defend themselves against
   the proofs of heresy which have been advanced, and then will be the
   time to find fault, if they can, with the definition framed against
   them [761] . For no one, on being convicted of murder or adultery, is
   at liberty after the trial to arraign the sentence of the judge, why he
   spoke in this way and not in that [762] . For this does not exculpate
   the convict, but rather increases his crime on the score of petulance
   and audacity. In like manner, let these either prove that their
   sentiments are religious (for they were then accused and convicted, and
   their complaints are subsequent, and it is just that those who are
   under a charge should confine themselves to their own defence), or if
   they have an unclean conscience, and are aware of their own irreligion,
   let them not complain of what they do not understand, or they will
   bring on themselves a double imputation, of irreligion and of
   ignorance. Rather let them investigate the matter in a docile spirit,
   and learning what hitherto they have not known, cleanse their
   irreligious ears with the spring of truth and the doctrines of religion
   [763] .

   3. Now it happened to Eusebius and his fellows in the Nicene Council as
   follows:--while they stood out in their irreligion, and attempted their
   fight against God [764] , the terms they used were replete with
   irreligion; but the assembled Bishops who were three hundred more or
   less, mildly and charitably required of them to explain and defend
   themselves on religious grounds. Scarcely, however, did they begin to
   speak, when they were condemned [765] , and one differed from another;
   then perceiving the straits in which their heresy lay, they remained
   dumb, and by their silence confessed the disgrace which came upon their
   heterodoxy. On this the Bishops, having negatived the terms they had
   invented, published against them the sound and ecclesiastical faith;
   and, as all subscribed it, Eusebius and his fellows subscribed it also
   in those very words, of which they are now complaining, I mean, "of the
   essence" and "one in essence," and that "the Son of God is neither
   creature or work, nor in the number of things originated [766] , but
   that the Word is an offspring from the substance of the Father." And
   what is strange indeed, Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea in Palestine, who had
   denied the day before, but afterwards subscribed, sent to his Church a
   letter, saying that this was the Church's faith, and the tradition of
   the Fathers; and made a public profession that they were before in
   error, and were rashly contending against the truth. For though he was
   ashamed at that time to adopt these phrases, and excused himself to the
   Church in his own way, yet he certainly means to imply all this in his
   Epistle, by his not denying the "one in essence," and "of the essence."
   And in this way he got into a difficulty; for while he was excusing
   himself, he went on to attack the Arians, as stating that "the Son was
   not before His generation," and as thereby rejecting His existence
   before His birth in the flesh. And this Acacius is aware of also,
   though he too through fear may pretend otherwise because of the times
   and deny the fact. Accordingly I have subjoined at the end the letter
   of Eusebius, that thou mayest know from it the disrespect towards their
   own doctors shewn by Christ's enemies, and singularly by Acacius
   himself [767] .

   4. Are they not then committing a crime, in their very thought to
   gainsay so great and ecumenical a Council? are they not in
   transgression, when they dare to confront that good definition against
   Arianism, acknowledged, as it is, by those who had in the first
   instance taught them irreligion? And supposing, even after
   subscription, Eusebius and his fellows did change again, and return
   like dogs to their own vomit of irreligion, do not the present
   gain-sayers deserve still greater detestation, because they thus
   sacrifice [768] their souls' liberty to others; and are willing to take
   these persons as masters of their heresy, who are, as James [769] has
   said, double-minded men, and unstable in all their ways, not having one
   opinion, but changing to and fro, and now recommending certain
   statements, but soon dishonouring them, and in turn recommending what
   just now they were blaming? But this, as the Shepherd has said, is "the
   child of the devil [770] ," and the note of hucksters rather than of
   doctors. For, what our Fathers have delivered, this is truly doctrine;
   and this is truly the token of doctors, to confess the same thing with
   each other, and to vary neither from themselves nor from their fathers;
   whereas they who have not this character are to be called not true
   doctors but evil. Thus the Greeks, as not witnessing to the same
   doctrines, but quarrelling one with another, have no truth of teaching;
   but the holy and veritable heralds of the truth agree together, and do
   not differ. For though they lived in different times, yet they one and
   all tend the same way, being prophets of the one God, and preaching the
   same Word harmoniously [771] .

   5. And thus what Moses taught, that Abraham observed; and what Abraham
   observed, that Noah and Enoch acknowledged, discriminating pure from
   impure, and becoming acceptable to God. For Abel too in this way
   witnessed, knowing what he had learned from Adam, who himself had
   learned from that Lord, who said, when He came at the end of the ages
   for the abolishment of sin, "I give no new commandment unto you, but an
   old commandment, which ye have heard from the beginning [772] ."
   Wherefore also the blessed Apostle Paul, who had learned it from Him,
   when describing ecclesiastical functions, forbade that deacons, not to
   say bishops, should be double-tongued [773] ; and in his rebuke of the
   Galatians, he made a broad declaration, "If anyone preach any other
   Gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be anathema, as I
   have said, so say I again. If even we, or an Angel from heaven should
   preach unto you any other Gospel than that ye have received, let him be
   anathema [774] ." Since then the Apostle thus speaks, let these men
   either anathematise Eusebius and his fellows, at least as changing
   round and professing what is contrary to their subscriptions; or, if
   they acknowledge that their subscriptions were good, let them not utter
   complaints against so great a Council. But if they do neither the one
   nor the other, they are themselves too plainly the sport of every wind
   and surge, and are influenced by opinions, not their own, but of
   others, and being such, are as little worthy of deference now as
   before, in what they allege. Rather let them cease to carp at what they
   understand not; lest so be that not knowing to discriminate, they
   simply call evil good and good evil, and think that bitter is sweet and
   sweet is bitter. Doubtless, they desire that doctrines which have been
   judged wrong and have been reprobated should gain the ascendancy, and
   they make violent efforts to prejudice what was rightly defined. Nor
   should there be any reason on our part for any further explanation, or
   answer to their excuses, neither on theirs for further resistance, but
   for an acquiescence in what the leaders of their heresy subscribed; for
   though the subsequent change of Eusebius and his fellows was suspicious
   and immoral, their subscription, when they had the opportunity of at
   least some little defence of themselves, is a certain proof of the
   irreligion of their doctrine. For they would not have subscribed
   previously had they not condemned the heresy, nor would they have
   condemned it, had they not been encompassed with difficulty and shame;
   so that to change back again is a proof of their contentious zeal for
   irreligion. These men also ought therefore, as I have said, to keep
   quiet; but since from an extraordinary want of modesty, they hope
   perhaps to be able to advocate this diabolical [775] irreligion better
   than the others, therefore, though in my former letter written to thee,
   I have already argued at length against them, notwithstanding, come let
   us now also examine them, in each of their separate statements, as
   their predecessors; for now not less than then their heresy shall be
   shewn to have no soundness in it, but to be from evil spirits.

   and is very frequent in Athan., chiefly with a reference to Arianism.
   He draws it out at length, Orat. ii. Â§34. Elsewhere, he uses the image
   for the evil influences introduced into the soul upon Adam's fall,
   contr. Apoll. i. Â§15. as does S. IrenÃ¦us, HÃ¦r. iv. 40. n. 3. using it

   [761] The Council did two things, anathematise the Arian positions (at
   the end of the Creed), and establish the true doctrine by the insertion
   of the phrases, "of the substance" and "one in substance." Athan. says
   that the Arians must not criticise the latter before they had cleared
   themselves of the former. Thus he says presently, that they were at
   once irreligious in their faith and ignorant in their criticism; and
   speaks of the Council negativing their formulÃ¦, and substituting those
   which were "sound and ecclesiastical." vid. also n. 4.

   [762] And so S. Leo "passim" concerning the Council of Chalcedon,
   "Concord will be easily established, if the hearts of all concur in

   Ep. 157. c. 3. "To be seeking for what has been disclosed, to retract
   what has been perfected, to tear up what has been laid down (definita),
   what is this but to be unthankful for what we gained?" Ep. 162. vid.

   but a rebel." Ep. 164. c. l. fin. vid. also Epp. 145, and 156, where he

   Chapter III.--Two senses of the word Son, 1. adoptive; 2. essential;
   attempts of Arians to find a third meaning between these; e.g. that our
   Lord only was created immediately by God (Asterius's view), or that our
   Lord alone partakes the Father. The second and true sense; God begets
   as He makes, really; though His creation and generation are not like
   man's; His generation independent of time; generation implies an
   internal, and therefore an eternal, act in God; explanation of Prov.
   viii. 22.

   6. They say then what the others held and dared to maintain before
   them; "Not always Father, not always Son; for the Son was not before
   His generation, but, as others, came to be from nothing; and in
   consequence God was not always Father of the Son; but, when the Son
   came to be and was created, then was God called His Father. For the
   Word is a creature and a work, and foreign and unlike the Father in
   essence; and the Son is neither by nature the Father's true Word, nor
   His only and true Wisdom; but being a creature and one of the works, He
   is improperly [776] called Word and Wisdom; for by the Word which is in
   God was He made, as were all things. Wherefore the Son is not true God
   [777] ."

   Now it may serve to make them understand what they are saying, to ask
   them first this, what in fact a son is, and of what is that name
   significant [778] . In truth, Divine Scripture acquaints us with a
   double sense of this word:--one which Moses sets before us in the Law,
   When ye shall hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep all His
   commandments which I command thee this day, to do that which is right
   in the eyes of the Lord thy God, ye are children of the Lord your God
   [779] ;' as also in the Gospel, John says, But as many as received Him,
   to them gave He power to become the sons of God [780] :'--and the other
   sense, that in which Isaac is son of Abraham, and Jacob of Isaac, and
   the Patriarchs of Jacob. Now in which of these two senses do they
   understand the Son of God that they relate such fables as the
   foregoing? for I feel sure they will issue in the same irreligion with
   Eusebius and his fellows.

   If in the first, which belongs to those who gain the name by grace from
   moral improvement, and receive power to become sons of God (for this is
   what their predecessors said), then He would seem to differ from us in
   nothing; no, nor would He be Only-begotten, as having obtained the
   title of Son as others from His virtue. For granting what they say,
   that, whereas His qualifications were fore-known [781] , He therefore
   received grace from the first, the name, and the glory of the name,
   from His very first beginning, still there will be no difference
   between Him and those who receive the name after their actions, so long
   as this is the ground on which He as others has the character of son.
   For Adam too, though he received grace from the first, and upon his
   creation was at once placed in paradise, differed in no respect either
   from Enoch, who was translated thither after some time from his birth
   on his pleasing God, or from the Apostle, who likewise was caught up to
   Paradise after his actions; nay, not from him who once was a thief, who
   on the ground of his confession, received a promise that he should be
   forthwith in paradise.

   7. When thus pressed, they will perhaps make an answer which has
   brought them into trouble many times already; "We consider that the Son
   has this prerogative over others, and therefore is called
   Only-begotten, because He alone was brought to be by God alone, and all
   other things were created by God through the Son [782] ." Now I wonder
   who it was [783] that suggested to you so futile and novel an idea as
   that the Father alone wrought with His own hand the Son alone, and that
   all other things were brought to be by the Son as by an under-worker.
   If for the toil's sake God was content with making the Son only,
   instead of making all things at once, this is an irreligious thought,
   especially in those who know the words of Esaias, The everlasting God,
   the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, hungereth not, neither
   is weary; there is no searching of His understanding [784] .' Rather it
   is He who gives strength to the hungry, and through His Word refreshes
   the labouring [785] . Again, it is irreligious to suppose that He
   disdained, as if a humble task, to form the creatures Himself which
   came after the Son; for there is no pride in that God, who goes down
   with Jacob into Egypt, and for Abraham's sake corrects Abimelek because
   of Sara, and speaks face to face with Moses, himself a man, and
   descends upon Mount Sinai, and by His secret grace fights for the
   people against Amalek. However, you are false even in this assertion,
   for He made us, and not we ourselves [786] .' He it is who through His
   Word made all things small and great, and we may not divide the
   creation, and says this is the Father's, and this the Son's, but they
   are of one God, who uses His proper Word as a Hand [787] , and in Him
   does all things. This God Himself shews us, when He says, All these
   things hath My Hand made [788] ;' while Paul taught us as he had
   learned [789] , that There is one God, from whom all things; and one
   Lord Jesus Christ, through whom all things [790] .' Thus He, always as
   now, speaks to the sun and it rises, and commands the clouds and it
   rains upon one place; and where it does not rain, it is dried up. And
   He bids the earth yield her fruits, and fashions Jeremias [791] in the
   womb. But if He now does all this, assuredly at the beginning also He
   did not disdain to make all things Himself through the Word; for these
   are but parts of the whole.

   8. But let us suppose that the other creatures could not endure to be
   wrought by the absolute Hand of the Unoriginate [792] and therefore the
   Son alone was brought into being by the Father alone, and other things
   by the Son as an underworker and assistant, for this is what Asterius
   the sacrificer [793] has written, and Arius has transcribed [794] and
   bequeathed to his own friends, and from that time they use this form of
   words, broken reed as it is, being ignorant, the bewildered men, how
   brittle it is. For if it was impossible for things originate to bear
   the hand of God, and you hold the Son to be one of their number, how
   was He too equal to this formation by God alone? and if a Mediator
   became necessary that things originate might come to be, and you hold
   the Son to be originated, then must there have been some medium before
   Him, for His creation; and that Mediator himself again being a
   creature, it follows that he too needed another Mediator for his own
   constitution. And though we were to devise another, we must first
   devise his Mediator, so that we shall never come to an end. And thus a
   Mediator being ever in request, never will the creation be constituted,
   because nothing originate, as you say, can bear the absolute hand of
   the Unoriginate [795] . And if, on your perceiving the extravagance of
   this, you begin to say that the Son, though a creature, was made
   capable of being made by the Unoriginate, then it follows that other
   things also, though originated, are capable of being wrought
   immediately by the Unoriginate; for the Son too is but a creature in
   your judgment, as all of them. And accordingly the origination of the
   Word is superfluous, according to your irreligious and futile
   imagination, God being sufficient for the immediate formation of all
   things, and all things originate being capable of sustaining His
   absolute hand.

   These irreligious men then having so little mind amid their madness,
   let us see whether this particular sophism be not even more irrational
   than the others. Adam was created alone by God alone through the Word;
   yet no one would say that Adam had any prerogative over other men, or
   was different from those who came after him, granting that he alone was
   made and fashioned by God alone, and we all spring from Adam, and
   consist according to succession of the race, so long as he was
   fashioned from the earth as others, and at first not being, afterwards
   came to be.

   9. But though we were to allow some prerogative to the Protoplast as
   having been deemed worthy of the hand of God, still it must be one of
   honour not of nature. For he came of the earth, as other men; and the
   hand which then fashioned Adam, is also both now and ever fashioning
   and giving entire consistence to those who come after him. And God
   Himself declares this to Jeremiah, as I said before; Before I formed
   thee in the womb, I knew thee [796] ;' and so He says of all, All those
   things hath My hand made [797] ;' and again by Isaiah, Thus saith the
   Lord, thy redeemer, and He that formed thee from the womb, I am the
   Lord that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone;
   that spreadeth abroad the earth by Myself [798] .' And David, knowing
   this, says in the Psalm, Thy hands have made me and fashioned me [799]
   ;' and he who says in Isaiah, Thus saith the Lord who formed me from
   the womb to be His servant [800] ,' signifies the same. Therefore, in
   respect of nature, he differs nothing from us though he precede us in
   time, so long as we all consist and are created by the same hand. If
   then these be your thoughts, O Arians, about the Son of God too, that
   thus He subsists and came to be, then in your judgment He will differ
   nothing on the score of nature from others, so long as He too was not,
   and came to be, and the name was by grace united to Him in His creation
   for His virtue's sake. For He Himself is one of those, from what you
   say, of whom the Spirit says in the Psalms, He spake the word, and they
   were made; He commanded, and they were created [801] .' If so, who was
   it by whom God gave command [802] for the Son's creation? for a Word
   there must be by whom God gave command, and in whom the works are
   created; but you have no other to shew than the Word you deny, unless
   indeed you should devise again some new notion.

   "Yes," they will say, "we have another;" (which indeed I formerly heard
   Eusebius and his fellows use), "on this score do we consider that the
   Son of God has a prerogative over others, and is called Only-begotten,
   because He alone partakes the Father, and all other things partake the
   Son." Thus they weary themselves in changing and in varying their
   phrases like colours [803] ; however, this shall not save them from an
   exposure, as men that are of the earth, speaking vainly, and wallowing
   in their own conceits as in mire.

   10. For if He were called God's Son, and we the Son's sons, their
   fiction were plausible; but if we too are said to be sons of that God,
   of whom He is Son, then we too partake the Father [804] , who says, I
   have begotten and exalted children [805] .' For if we did not partake
   Him, He had not said, I have begotten;' but if He Himself begat us, no
   other than He is our Father [806] . And, as before, it matters not,
   whether the Son has something more and was made first, but we something
   less, and were made afterwards, as long as we all partake, and are
   called sons, of the same Father [807] . For the more or less does not
   indicate a different nature; but attaches to each according to the
   practice of virtue; and one is placed over ten cities, another over
   five; and some sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of
   Israel; and others hear the words, Come, ye blessed of My Father,' and,
   Well done, good and faithful servant [808] .' With such ideas, however,
   no wonder they imagine that of such a Son God was not always Father,
   and such a Son was not always in being, but was generated from nothing
   as a creature, and was not before His generation; for such an one is
   other than the True Son of God.

   But to persist in such teaching does not consist with piety [809] , for
   it is rather the tone of thought of Sadducees and the Samosatene [810]
   ; it remains then to say that the Son of God is so called according to
   the other sense, in which Isaac was son of Abraham; for what is
   naturally begotten from any one and does not accrue to him from
   without, that in the nature of things is a son, and that is what the
   name implies [811] . Is then the Son's generation one of human
   affection? (for this perhaps, as their predecessors [812] , they too
   will be ready to object in their ignorance;)--in no wise; for God is
   not as man, nor men as God. Men were created of matter, and that
   passible; but God is immaterial and incorporeal. And if so be the same
   terms are used of God and man in divine Scripture, yet the
   clear-sighted, as Paul enjoins, will study it, and thereby
   discriminate, and dispose of what is written according to the nature of
   each subject, and avoid any confusion of sense, so as neither to
   conceive of the things of God in a human way, nor to ascribe the things
   of man to God [813] . For this were to mix wine with water [814] , and
   to place upon the altar strange fire with that which is divine.

   11. For God creates, and to create is also ascribed to men; and God has
   being, and men are said to be, having received from God this gift also.
   Yet does God create as men do? or is His being as man's being? Perish
   the thought; we understand the terms in one sense of God, and in
   another of men. For God creates, in that He calls what is not into
   being, needing nothing thereunto; but men work some existing material,
   first praying, and so gaining the wit to make, from that God who has
   framed all things by His proper Word. And again men, being incapable of
   self-existence, are enclosed in place, and consist in the Word of God;
   but God is self-existent, enclosing all things, and enclosed by none;
   within all according to His own goodness and power, yet without all in
   His proper nature [815] . As then men create not as God creates, as
   their being is not such as God's being, so men's generation is in one
   way, and the Son is from the Father in another [816] . For the
   offspring of men are portions of their fathers, since the very nature
   of bodies is not uncompounded, but in a state of flux [817] , and
   composed of parts; and men lose their substance in begetting, and again
   they gain substance from the accession of food. And on this account men
   in their time become fathers of many children; but God, being without
   parts, is Father of the Son without partition or passion; for there is
   neither effluence [818] of the Immaterial, nor influx from without, as
   among men; and being uncompounded in nature, He is Father of One Only
   Son. This is why He is Only-begotten, and alone in the Father's bosom,
   and alone is acknowledged by the Father to be from Him, saying, This is
   My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased [819] .' And He too is the
   Father's Word, from which may be understood the impassible and
   impartitive nature of the Father, in that not even a human word is
   begotten with passion or partition, much less the Word of God [820] .
   Wherefore also He sits, as Word, at the Father's right hand; for where
   the Father is, there also is His Word; but we, as His works, stand in
   judgment before Him; and, while He is adored, because He is Son of the
   adorable Father, we adore, confessing Him Lord and God, because we are
   creatures and other than He.

   12. The case being thus, let who will among them consider the matter,
   so that one may abash them by the following question; Is it right to
   say that what is God's offspring and proper to Him is out of nothing?
   or is it reasonable in the very idea, that what is from God has accrued
   to Him, that a man should dare to say that the Son is not always? For
   in this again the generation of the Son exceeds and transcends the
   thoughts of man, that we become fathers of our own children in time,
   since we ourselves first were not and then came into being; but God, in
   that He ever is, is ever Father of the Son [821] . And the origination
   of mankind is brought home to us from things that are parallel; but,
   since no one knoweth the Son but the Father, and no one knoweth the
   Father but the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him [822]
   ,' therefore the sacred writers to whom the Son has revealed Him, have
   given us a certain image from things visible, saying, Who is the
   brightness of His glory, and the Expression of His Person [823] ;' and
   again, For with Thee is the well of life, and in Thy light shall we see
   light [824] ;' and when the Word chides Israel, He says, Thou hast
   forsaken the Fountain of wisdom [825] ;' and this Fountain it is which
   says, They have forsaken Me the Fountain of living waters [826] .' And
   mean indeed and very dim is the illustration [827] compared with what
   we desiderate; but yet it is possible from it to understand something
   above man's nature, instead of thinking the Son's generation to be on a
   level with ours. For who can even imagine that the radiance of light
   ever was not, so that he should dare to say that the Son was not
   always, or that the Son was not before His generation? or who is
   capable of separating the radiance from the sun, or to conceive of the
   fountain as ever void of life, that he should madly say, The Son is
   from nothing,' who says, I am the life [828] ,' or alien to the
   Father's essence,' who, says, He that hath seen Me, hath seen the
   Father [829] ?' for the sacred writers wishing us thus to understand,
   have given these illustrations; and it is unseemly and most
   irreligious, when Scripture contains such images, to form ideas
   concerning our Lord from others which are neither in Scripture, nor
   have any religious bearing.

   13. Therefore let them tell us, from what teacher or by what tradition
   they derived these notions concerning the Saviour? "We have read," they
   will say, "in the Proverbs, The Lord created me a beginning of His ways
   unto His works [830] ;'" this Eusebius and his fellows used to insist
   on [831] , and you write me word, that the present men also, though
   overthrown and confuted by an abundance of arguments, still were
   putting about in every quarter this passage, and saying that the Son
   was one of the creatures, and reckoning Him with things originated. But
   they seem to me to have a wrong understanding of this passage also; for
   it has a religious and very orthodox sense, which had they understood,
   they would not have blasphemed the Lord of glory. For on comparing what
   has been above stated with this passage, they will find a great
   difference between them [832] . For what man of right understanding
   does not perceive, that what are created and made are external to the
   maker; but the Son, as the foregoing argument has shewn, exists not
   externally, but from the Father who begat Him? for man too both builds
   a house and begets a son, and no one would reverse things, and say that
   the house or the ship were begotten by the builder [833] , but the son
   was created and made by him; nor again that the house was an image of
   the maker, but the son unlike him who begat him; but rather he will
   confess that the son is an image of the father, but the house a work of
   art, unless his mind be disordered, and he beside himself. Plainly,
   divine Scripture, which knows better than any the nature of everything,
   says through Moses, of the creatures, In the beginning God created the
   heaven and the earth [834] ;' but of the Son it introduces not another,
   but the Father Himself saying, I have begotten Thee from the womb
   before the morning star [835] ;' and again, Thou art My Son, this day
   have I begotten Thee [836] .' And the Lord says of Himself in the
   Proverbs, Before all the hills He begets me [837] ;' and concerning
   things originated and created John speaks, All things were made by Him
   [838] ;' but preaching of the Lord, he says, The Only-begotten Son, who
   is in the bosom of the Father, He declared Him [839] .' If then son,
   therefore not creature; if creature, not son; for great is the
   difference between them, and son and creature cannot be the same,
   unless His essence be considered to be at once from God, and external
   to God.

   14. Has then the passage no meaning?' for this, like a swarm of gnats,
   they are droning about us [840] . No surely, it is not without meaning,
   but has a very apposite one; for it is true to say that the Son was
   created too, but this took place when He became man; for creation
   belongs to man. And any one may find this sense duly given in the
   divine oracles, who, instead of accounting their study a secondary
   matter, investigates the time and characters [841] , and the object,
   and thus studies and ponders what he reads. Now as to the season spoken
   of, he will find for certain that, whereas the Lord always is, at
   length in fulness of the ages He became man; and whereas He is Son of
   God, He became Son of man also. And as to the object he will
   understand, that, wishing to annul our death, He took on Himself a body
   from the Virgin Mary; that by offering this unto the Father a sacrifice
   for all, He might deliver us all, who by fear of death were all our
   life through subject to bondage [842] . And as to the character, it is
   indeed the Saviour's, but is said of Him when He took a body and said,
   The Lord created me a beginning of His ways unto His works [843] .' For
   as it properly belongs to God's Son to be everlasting. and in the
   Father's bosom, so on His becoming man, the words befitted Him, The
   Lord created me.' For then it is said of Him, as also that He hungered,
   and thirsted, and asked where Lazarus lay, and suffered, and rose again
   [844] . And as, when we hear of Him as Lord and God and true Light, we
   understand Him as being from the Father, so on hearing, The Lord
   created,' and Servant,' and He suffered,' we shall justly ascribe this,
   not to the Godhead, for it is irrelevant, but we must interpret it by
   that flesh which He bore for our sakes: for to it these things are
   proper, and this flesh was none other's than the Word's. And if we wish
   to know the object attained by this, we shall find it to be as follows:
   that the Word was made flesh in order to offer up this body for all,
   and that we partaking of His Spirit, might be deified [845] , a gift
   which we could not otherwise have gained than by His clothing Himself
   in our created body [846] , for hence we derive our name of "men of
   God" and "men in Christ." But as we, by receiving the Spirit, do not
   lose our own proper substance, so the Lord, when made man for us, and
   bearing a body, was no less God; for He was not lessened by the
   envelopment of the body, but rather deified it and rendered it immortal
   [847] .

   [776] katachrestikos. This word is noticed and protested against by

   [778] Vid. Orat. i. Â§38. The controversy turned on the question what
   was meant by the word Son.' Though the Arians would not allow with the
   Catholics that our Lord was Son by nature, and maintained that the word
   implied a beginning of existence, they did not dare to say that He was
   Son merely in the sense in which we are sons, though, as Athan.
   contends, they necessarily tended to this conclusion, directly they
   receded from the Catholic view. Thus Arius said that He was a creature,
   but not as one of the creatures.' Orat. ii. Â§19. Valens at Ariminum
   said the same, Jerom. adv. Lucifer. 18. Hilary says, that not daring
   directly to deny that He was God, the Arians merely asked whether He
   was a Son.' de Trin. viii. 3. Athanasius remarks upon this reluctance
   to speak out, challenging them to present the heresy naked,' de Sent.
   Dionys. 2. init. No one,' he says elsewhere, puts a light under a
   bushel; let them shew the world their heresy naked.' Ep. Ã†g. 18. vid.
   ibid. 10. In like manner, Basil says that (though Arius was really like
   Eunomius, in faith, contr. Eunom. i. 4) Aetius his master was the first
   to teach openly (phaneros), that the Father's substance was unlike,
   anomoios, the Son's. ibid. i. 1. Epiphanius HÃ¦r. 76 p. 949. seems to
   say that the elder Arians held the divine generation in a sense in
   which Aetius did not, that is, they were not so consistent and definite
   as he. Athan. goes on to mention some of the attempts of the Arians to
   find some theory short of orthodoxy, yet short of that extreme heresy,
   on the other hand, which they felt ashamed to avow.

   [803] ad Serap. i. 3.

   [804] His argument is, that if the Son but partook the Father in the
   sense in which we partake the Son, then the Son would not impart to us
   the Father, but Himself, and would be a separating as well as uniting
   medium between the Father and us; whereas He brings us so near to the
   Father, that we are the Father's children, not His, and therefore He
   must be Himself one with the Father, or the Father must be in Him with
   an incomprehensible completeness. vid. de Synod. Â§51. contr. Gent. 46.
   fin. Hence S. Augustin says, As the Father has life in Himself, so hath
   He given also to the Son to have life in Himself, not by participating,
   but in Himself. For we have not life in ourselves, but in our God. But
   that Father, who has life in Himself, begat a Son such, as to have life
   in Himself, not to become partaker of life, but to be Himself life; and
   of that life to make us partakers.' Serm. 127. de Verb. Evang. 9.

   [805] Is. i. 2.

   [806] To say God is wholly partaken, is the same as saying that God
   begets.' Orat. i. Â§16. And in like manner, our inferior participation
   involves such sonship as is vouchsafed to us.

   [807] And so in Orat. ii. Â§19-22. Though the Son surpassed other things
   on a comparison, yet He were equally a creature with them; for even in
   those things which are of a created nature, we may find some things
   surpassing others. Star, for instance, differs from star in glory, yet
   it does not follow that some are sovereign, and others serve, &c.' ii.

   [809] i.e. since it is impossible they can persist in evasions so
   manifest as these, nothing is left but to take the other sense of the
   word.

   [810] Paul of Samosata [see Prolegg. ch. ii. Â§3 (2)a.]

   [811] The force lies in the word phusei, naturally,' which the Council
   expressed still more definitely by essence.' Thus Cyril says, the term
   "Son" denotes the essential origin from the Father.' Dial. 5. p. 573.
   And Gregory Nyssen, the title "Son" does not simply express the being
   from another' vid. infra. Â§19.), but relationship according to nature.
   contr. Eunom. ii. p. 91. Again S. Basil says, that Father is a term of
   relationship,' oikeioseos. contr. Eunom. ii. 24. init. And hence he
   remarks, that we too are properly, kurios, sons of God, as becoming
   related to Him through works of the Spirit. ii. 23. So also Cyril, loc.
   cit. Elsewhere S. Basil defines father one who gives to another the
   origin of being according to a nature like his own;' and a son one who
   possesses the origin of being from another by generation,' contr. Eun.
   ii. 22. On the other hand, the Arians at the first denied that by
   nature there was any Son of God.' Theod. H. E. i. 3. p. 732.

   [812] vid. Eusebius, in his Letter, supr. p. 73 sq.: also Socr. Hist.
   i. 8. Epiphan. HÃ¦r. 69. n. 8 and 15.

   [813] One of the characteristic points in Athanasius is his constant
   attention to the sense of doctrine, or the meaning of writers, in
   preference to the words used. Thus he scarcely uses the symbol
   homoousion, one in substance, throughout his Orations, and in the de
   Synod. acknowledges the Semiarians as brethren. Hence infr. Â§18. he
   says, that orthodox doctrine is revered by all though expressed in
   strange language, provided the speaker means religiously, and wishes to
   convey by it a religious sense.' vid. also Â§21. He says, that Catholics
   are able to speak freely,' or to expatiate, parresiazometha, out of
   Divine Scripture.' Orat. i. Â§9. vid. de Sent. Dionys. Â§20. init. Again:
   The devil spoke from Scripture, but was silenced by the Saviour; Paul
   spoke from profane writers, yet, being a saint, he has a religious
   meaning.' de Syn. Â§39, also ad Ep. Ã†g. 8. Again, speaking of the
   apparent contrariety between two Councils, It were unseemly to make the
   one conflict with the other, for all their members are fathers; and it
   were profane to decide that these spoke well and those ill, for all of
   them have slept in Christ.' Â§43. also Â§47. Again: Not the phrase, but
   the meaning and the religious life, is the recommendation of the
   faithful.' ad Ep. Ã†g. Â§9.

   [814] vid. Orat. iii. Â§35, and Isa. i. 22.

   [815] Vid. also Incarn. Â§17. This contrast is not commonly found in
   ecclesiastical writers, who are used to say that God is present
   everywhere, in substance as well as by energy or power. S. Clement,
   however, expresses himself still more strongly in the same way, In
   substance far off (for how can the originate come close to the
   Unoriginate?), but most close in power, in which the universe is
   embosomed.' Strom. 2. circ. init. but the parenthesis explains his
   meaning. Vid. Cyril. Thesaur. 6. p. 44. The common doctrine of the
   Fathers is, that God is present everywhere in substance. Vid. Petav. de
   Deo, iii. 8. and 9. It may be remarked, that S. Clement continues
   neither enclosing nor enclosed.'

   [816] In Almighty God is the perfection and first pattern of what is
   seen in shadow in human nature, according to the imperfection of the
   subject matter; and this remark applies, as to creation, so to
   generation. Athanasius is led to state this more distinctly in another
   connection in Orat. i. Â§21. fin. It belongs to the Godhead alone, that
   the Father is properly (kurios) Father, and the Son properly (kurios)
   Son; and in Them and Them only does it hold that the Father is ever
   Father, and the Son ever Son.' Accordingly he proceeds, shortly
   afterwards, as in the text, to argue, For God does not make men His
   pattern, but rather we men, for that God is properly and alone truly
   Father of His own Son, are also called fathers of our own children, for
   "of Him is every father-hood in heaven and on earth named,"' Â§23. The
   Semiarians at Ancyra quote the same text for the same doctrine.
   Epiphan. HÃ¦r. 73. 5. As do Cyril in Joan. i. p. 24. Thesaur. 32. p.
   281. and Damascene de Fid. Orth. i. 8. The same parallel, as existing
   between creation and generation is insisted on by Isidor. Pel. Ep. iii.
   355. Basil contr. Eun. iv. p. 280 A., Cyril Thesaur. 6. p. 43. Epiph.
   HÃ¦r. 69. 36. and Gregor. Naz. Orat. 20. 9. who observes that God
   creates with a word, Ps. cxlviii. 5, which evidently transcends human
   creations. Theodorus Abucara, with the same object, draws out the
   parallel of life, zoe, as Athan. that of being, einai. Opusc. iii. p.
   420-422.

   743. On the other hand, Athanasius quotes it in a passage which he

   Thesaur. 5. p. 37. Also it implies that there is but One Son. vid.
   infr. Â§16. As the Origin is one essence, so its Word and Wisdom is one,
   essential and subsisting.' Orat. iv. 1. fin.

   [821] Man,' says S. Cyril, inasmuch as he had a beginning of being,
   also has of necessity a beginning of begetting, as what is from him is
   a thing generate, but....if God's essence transcend time, or origin, or
   interval, His generation too will transcend these; nor does it deprive
   the Divine Nature of the power of generating, that it doth not this in
   time. For other than human is the manner of divine generation; and
   together with God's existing is His generating implied, and the Son was
   in Him by generation, nor did His generation precede His existence, but
   He was always, and that by generation.' Thesaur. v. p. 35.

   single, He is impassibly and indivisibly Father of the Son...for...the
   Word and Wisdom is neither creature, nor part of Him Whose Word He is,

     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter IV.--Proof of the Catholic Sense of the Word Son. Power, Word
   or Reason, and Wisdom, the names of the Son, imply eternity; as well as
   the Father's title of Fountain. The Arians reply, that these do not
   formally belong to the essence of the Son, but are names given Him;
   that God has many words, powers, &c. Why there is but one Son and Word,
   &c. All the titles of the Son coincide in Him.

   15. This then is quite enough to expose the infamy of the Arian heresy;
   for, as the Lord has granted, out of their own words is irreligion
   brought home to them [848] . But come now and let us on our part act on
   the offensive, and call on them for an answer; for now is fair time,
   when their own ground has failed them, to question them on ours;
   perhaps it may abash the perverse, and disclose to them whence they
   have fallen. We have learned from divine Scripture, that the Son of
   God, as was said above, is the very Word and Wisdom of the Father. For
   the Apostle says, Christ the power of God and the Wisdom of God [849]
   ;' and John after saying, And the Word was made flesh,' at once adds,
   And we saw His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father,
   full of grace and truth [850] ,' so that, the Word being the
   Only-begotten Son, in this Word and in Wisdom heaven and earth and all
   that is therein were made. And of this Wisdom that God is Fountain we
   have learned from [851] Baruch, by Israel's being charged with having
   forsaken the Fountain of Wisdom. If then they deny Scripture, they are
   at once aliens to their name, and may fitly be called of all men
   atheists [852] , and Christ's enemies, for they have brought upon
   themselves these names. But if they agree with us that the sayings of
   Scripture are divinely inspired, let them dare to say openly what they
   think in secret that God was once wordless and wisdomless [853] ; and
   let them in their madness [854] say, There was once when He was not,'
   and, before His generation, Christ was not [855] ;' and again let them
   declare that the Fountain begat not Wisdom from itself, but acquired it
   from without, till they have the daring to say, The Son came of
   nothing;' whence it will follow that there is no longer a Fountain, but
   a sort of pool, as if receiving water from without, and usurping the
   name of Fountain [856] .

   16. How full of irreligion this is, I consider none can doubt who has
   ever so little understanding. But since they mutter something about
   Word and Wisdom being only names of the Son [857] , we must ask then,
   If these are only names of the Son, He must be something else beside
   them. And if He is higher than the names, it is not lawful from the
   lesser to denote the higher; but if He be less than the names, yet He
   surely must have in Him the principle of this more honourable
   appellation; and this implies his advance, which is an irreligion equal
   to anything that has gone before. For He who is in the Father, and in
   whom also the Father is, who says, I and the Father are one [858] ,'
   whom he that hath seen, hath seen the Father, to say that He has been
   exalted [859] by anything external, is the extreme of madness. However,
   when they are beaten hence, and like Eusebius and his fellows, are in
   these great straits, then they have this remaining plea, which Arius
   too in ballads, and in his own Thalia [860] , fabled, as a new
   difficulty: Many words speaketh God; which then of these are we to call
   Son and Word, Only-begotten of the Father [861] ?' Insensate, and
   anything but Christians [862] ! for first, on using such language about
   God, they conceive of Him almost as a man, speaking and reversing His
   first words by His second, just as if one Word from God were not
   sufficient for the framing of all things at the Father's will, and for
   His providential care of all. For His speaking many words would argue a
   feebleness in them all, each needing the service of the other. But that
   God should have one Word, which is the true doctrine, both shews the
   power of God, and the perfection of the Word that is from Him, and the
   religious understanding of them who thus believe.

   17. O that they would consent to confess the truth from this their own
   statement! for if they once grant that God produces words, they plainly
   know Him to be a Father; and acknowledging this, let them consider
   that, while they are loth to ascribe one Word to God, they are
   imagining that He is Father of many; and while they are loth to say
   that there is no Word of God at all, yet they do not confess that He is
   the Son of God,--which is ignorance of the truth, and inexperience in
   divine Scripture. For if God is Father of a word at all, wherefore is
   not He that is begotten a Son? And again, who should be Son of God, but
   His Word? For there are not many words, or each would be imperfect, but
   one is the Word, that He only may be perfect, and because, God being
   one, His Image too must be one, which is the Son. For the Son of God,
   as may be learnt from the divine oracles themselves, is Himself the
   Word of God, and the Wisdom, and the Image, and the Hand, and the
   Power; for God's offspring is one, and of the generation from the
   Father these titles are tokens [863] . For if you say the Son, you have
   declared what is from the Father by nature; and if you think of the
   Word, you are thinking again of what is from Him, and what is
   inseparable; and, speaking of Wisdom, again you mean just as much, what
   is not from without, but from Him and in Him; and if you name the Power
   and the Hand, again you speak of what is proper to essence; and,
   speaking of the Image, you signify the Son; for what else is like God
   but the offspring from Him? Doubtless the things, which came to be
   through the Word, these are founded in Wisdom' and what are founded in
   Wisdom,' these are all made by the Hand, and came to be through the
   Son. And we have proof of this, not from external sources, but from the
   Scriptures; for God Himself says by Isaiah the Prophet; My hand also
   hath laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand hath spanned
   the heavens [864] .' And again, And I will cover thee in the shadow of
   My Hand, by which I planted the heavens, and laid the foundations of
   the earth [865] .' And David being taught this, and knowing that the
   Lord's Hand was nothing else than Wisdom, says in the Psalm, In wisdom
   hast Thou made them all; the earth is full of Thy creation [866] .'
   Solomon also received the same from God, and said, The Lord by wisdom
   founded the earth [867] ,' and John, knowing that the Word was the Hand
   and the Wisdom, thus preached, In the beginning was the Word, and the
   Word was with God, and the Word was God; the same was in the beginning
   with God: all things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything
   made [868] .' And the Apostle, seeing that the Hand and the Wisdom and
   the Word was nothing else than the Son, says, God, who at sundry times
   and in divers manners spake in time past unto the Fathers by the
   Prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by His Son, whom He
   hath appointed Heir of all things, by whom also He made the ages [869]
   .' And again, There is one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all
   things, and we through Him [870] .' And knowing also that the Word, the
   Wisdom, the Son Himself was the Image of the Father, he says in the
   Epistle to the Colossians, Giving thanks to God and the Father, which
   hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in
   light, who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath
   translated us into the kingdom of His dear Son; in whom we have
   redemption, even the remission of sins; who is the Image of the
   Invisible God, the First-born of every creature; for by Him were all
   things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and
   invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions or principalities or
   powers; all things were created by Him and for Him; and He is before
   all things, and in Him all things consist [871] .' For as all things
   are created by the Word, so, because He is the Image, are they also
   created in Him [872] . And thus anyone who directs his thoughts to the
   Lord, will avoid stumbling upon the stone of offence, but rather will
   go forward to the brightness in the light of truth; for this is really
   the doctrine of truth, though these contentious men burst with spite
   [873] , neither religious toward God, nor abashed at their confutation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [848] The main argument of the Arians was that our lord was a Son, and
   therefore was not eternal, but of a substance which had a beginning.
   [Prolegg. ch. ii. Â§3 (2) a.] Accordingly Athanasius says, Having argued
   with them as to the meaning of their own selected term "Son," let us go
   on to others, which on the very face make for us, such as Word, Wisdom,
   &c.'

   the controversy, viz. that to deprive the Father of His Son or
   substantial Word (logos), is as great a sacrilege as to deny His
   Reason, logos, from which the Son receives His name. Thus Orat. i. Â§14.
   fin. Athan. says, imputing to God's nature an absence of His Word
   (alogian or irrationality), they are most irreligious.' Vid. Â§19. fin.
   24. Elsewhere, he says, Is a man not mad himself, who even entertains
   the thought that God is word-less and wisdom-less? for such
   illustrations and such images Scripture hath proposed, that,
   considering the inability of human nature to comprehend concerning God,
   we might even from these, however poorly and dimly, discern as far as
   is attainable.' Orat. ii. 32. vid. also iii. 63. iv. 12. Serap. ii. 2.

   Nicene Anathema.

   [856] And so pege xera. Serap. ii. 2. Orat. i. Â§14 fin. also ii. Â§2,
   where Athanasius speaks as if those who deny that Almighty God is
   Father, cannot really believe in Him as a Creator. If the divine
   substance be not fruitful (karpogonos), but barren, as they say, as a
   light which enlightens not, and a dry fountain, are they not ashamed to
   maintain that He possesses the creative energy?' Vid. also pege

   so that It no longer is perfect. This then is a token of its
   perfection, and the Son who went forth from Him apart from time, is a
   pledge (sphragis) to the Father that He is perfect.' Thesaur. p. 37.

   [857] Arius said, as the Eunomians after him, that the Son was not

   [861] As the Arians took the title Son in that part of its earthly
   sense in which it did not apply to our Lord, so they misinterpreted the
   title Word also; which denoted the Son's immateriality and indivisible
   presence in the Father, but did not express His perfection. Vid. Orat.

   doctrine), says, As there are gods many, but to us one God the Father,
   and many lords, but to us one Lord Jesus Christ, so there are many
   words, but we pray that in us may exist the Word that was in the
   beginning, with God, and was God.' In Joan. tom. ii. 3. Many things, it
   is acknowledged, does the Father speak to the Son,' say the Semiarians
   at Ancyra, but the words which God speaks to the Son, are not sons.
   They are not substances of God, but vocal energies; but the Son, though
   a Word, is not such, but, being a Son, is a substance.' Epiph. HÃ¦r. 73.
   12. The Semiarians are speaking against Sabellianism, which took the
   same ground here as Arianism; so did the heresy of the Samosatene, who
   according to Epiphanius, considered our Lord as the internal Word, or
   thought. HÃ¦r. 65. The term word in this inferior sense is often in
   Greek rhema. Epiph. supr. and Cyril, de Incarn. Unig. init. t. v. i. p.

   [862] If they understood and acknowledged the characteristic idea
   (charaktera) of Christianity, they would not have said that the Lord of
   glory was a creature.' Ad Serap. ii. 7. In Orat. i. Â§2, he says, Arians
   are not Christians because they are Arians, for Christians are called,
   not from Arius, but from Christ, who is their only Master. Vid. also de

   [863] All the titles of the Son of God are consistent with each other,
   and variously represent one and the same Person. Son' and Word,' denote
   His derivation; Word' and Image,' His Similitude; Word' and Wisdom,'
   His immateriality; Wisdom' and Hand,' His coexistence. If He is not

   Chapter V.--Defence of the Council's Phrases, "from the essence," And
   "one in essence." Objection that the phrases are not scriptural; we
   ought to look at the sense more than the wording; evasion of the Arians
   as to the phrase "of God" which is in Scripture; their evasion of all
   explanations but those which the Council selected, which were intended
   to negative the Arian formulÃ¦; protest against their conveying any
   material sense.

   18. Now Eusebius and his fellows were at the former period examined at
   great length, and convicted themselves, as I said before; on this they
   subscribed; and after this change of mind they kept in quiet and
   retirement [874] ; but since the present party, in the fresh arrogance
   of irreligion, and in dizziness about the truth, are full set upon
   accusing the Council, let them tell us what are the sort of Scriptures
   from which they have learned, or who is the Saint [875] by whom they
   have been taught, that they have heaped together the phrases, out of
   nothing [876] ,' and He was not before His generation,' and once He was
   not,' and alterable,' and pre-existence,' and at the will;' which are
   their fables in mockery of the Lord. For the blessed Paul in his
   Epistle to the Hebrews says, By faith we understand that the ages were
   framed by the Word of God, so that that which is seen was not made of
   things which do appear [877] .' But nothing is common to the Word with
   the ages [878] ; for He it is who is in existence before the ages, by
   whom also the ages came to be. And in the Shepherd [879] it is written
   (since they allege this book also, though it is not of the Canon [880]
   ), First of all believe, that God is one, who created all things, and
   arranged them, and brought all things from nothing into being;' but
   this again does not relate to the Son, for it speaks concerning all
   things which came to be through Him, from whom He is distinct; for it
   is not possible to reckon the Framer of all with the things made by
   Him, unless a man is so beside himself as to say that the architect
   also is the same as the buildings which he rears.

   Why then, when they have invented on their part unscriptural phrases,
   for the purposes of irreligion, do they accuse those who are religious
   in their use of them [881] ? For irreligiousness is utterly forbidden,
   though it be attempted to disguise it with artful expressions and
   plausible sophisms; but religiousness is confessed by all to be lawful,
   even though presented in strange phrases [882] , provided only they are
   used with a religious view, and a wish to make them the expression of
   religious thoughts. Now the aforesaid grovelling phrases of Christ's
   enemies have been shewn in these remarks to be both formerly and now
   replete with irreligion; whereas the definition of the Council against
   them, if accurately examined, will be found to be altogether a
   representation of the truth, and especially if diligent attention be
   paid to the occasion which gave rise to these expressions, which was
   reasonable, and was as follows:--

   19. The Council [883] wishing to do away with the irreligious phrases
   of the Arians, and to use instead the acknowledged words of the
   Scriptures, that the Son is not from nothing but from God,' and is
   Word' and Wisdom,' and not creature or work, but a proper offspring
   from the Father, Eusebius and his fellows, led by their inveterate
   heterodoxy, understood the phrase from God' as belonging to us, as if
   in respect to it the Word of God differed nothing from us, and that
   because it is written, There is one God, from whom, all things [884] ;'
   and again, Old things are passed away, behold, all things are become
   new, and all things are from God [885] .' But the Fathers, perceiving
   their craft and the cunning of their irreligion, were forced to express
   more distinctly the sense of the words from God.' Accordingly, they
   wrote from the essence of God [886] ,' in order that from God' might
   not be considered common and equal in the Son and in things originate,
   but that all others might be acknowledged as creatures, and the Word
   alone as from the Father. For though all things be said to be from God,
   yet this is not in the sense in which the Son is from Him; for as to
   the creatures, of God' is said of them on this account, in that they
   exist not at random or spontaneously, nor come to be by chance [887] ,
   according to those philosophers who refer them to the combination of
   atoms, and to elements of similar structure,--nor as certain heretics
   speak of a distinct Framer,--nor as others again say that the
   constitution of all things is from certain Angels;--but in that
   (whereas God is), it was by Him that all things were brought into
   being, not being before, through His Word; but as to the Word, since He
   is not a creature, He alone is both called and is from the Father;' and
   it is significant of this sense to say that the Son is from the essence
   of the Father,' for to nothing originate does this attach. In truth,
   when Paul says that all things are from God,' he immediately adds, and
   one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom all things [888] ,' in order to
   shew all men, that the Son is other than all these things which came to
   be from God (for the things which came to be from God, came to be
   through His Son); and that he had used his foregoing words with
   reference to the world as framed by God [889] , and not as if all
   things were from the Father as the Son is. For neither are other things
   as the Son, nor is the Word one among others, for He is Lord and Framer
   of all; and on this account did the Holy Council declare expressly that
   He was of the essence [890] of the Father, that we might believe the
   Word to be other than the nature of things originate, being alone truly
   from God; and that no subterfuge should be left open to the
   irreligious. This then was the reason why the Council wrote of the
   essence.'

   20. Again, when the Bishops said that the Word must be described as the
   True Power and Image of the Father, in all things exact [891] and like
   the Father, and as unalterable, and as always, and as in Him without
   division (for never was the Word not, but He was always, existing
   everlastingly with the Father, as the radiance of light), Eusebius and
   his fellows endured indeed, as not daring to contradict, being put to
   shame by the arguments which were urged against them; but withal they
   were caught whispering to each other and winking with their eyes, that
   like,' and always,' and power,' and in Him,' were, as before, common to
   us and the Son, and that it was no difficulty to agree to these. As to
   like,' they said that it is written of us, Man is the image and glory
   of God [892] :' always,' that it was written, For we which live are
   alway [893] :' in Him,' In Him we live and move and have our being
   [894] :' unalterable,' that it is written, Nothing shall separate us
   from the love of Christ [895] :' as to power,' that the caterpillar and
   the locust are called power' and great power [896] ,' and that it is
   often said of the people, for instance, All the power of the Lord came
   out of the land of Egypt [897] :' and there are others also, heavenly
   ones, for Scripture says, The Lord of powers is with us, the God of
   Jacob is our refuge [898] .' Indeed Asterius, by title the sophist, had
   said the like in writing, having learned it from them, and before him
   Arius [899] having learned it also, as has been said. But the Bishops
   discerning in this too their dissimulation, and whereas it is written,
   Deceit is in the heart of the irreligious that imagine evil [900] ,'
   were again compelled on their part to collect the sense of the
   Scriptures, and to re-say and re-write what they had said before, more
   distinctly still, namely, that the Son is one in essence [901] ' with
   the Father: by way of signifying, that the Son was from the Father, and
   not merely like, but the same in likeness [902] , and of shewing that
   the Son's likeness and unalterableness was different from such copy of
   the same as is ascribed to us, which we acquire from virtue on the
   ground of observance of the commandments. For bodies which are like
   each other may be separated and become at distances from each other, as
   are human sons relatively to their parents (as it is written concerning
   Adam and Seth, who was begotten of him that he was like him after his
   own pattern [903] ); but since the generation of the Son from the
   Father is not according to the nature of men, and not only like, but
   also inseparable from the essence of the Father, and He and the Father
   are one, as He has said Himself, and the Word is ever in the Father and
   the Father in the Word, as the radiance stands towards the light (for
   this the phrase itself indicates), therefore the Council, as
   understanding this, suitably wrote one in essence,' that they might
   both defeat the perverseness of the heretics, and shew that the Word
   was other than originated things. For, after thus writing, they at once
   added, But they who say that the Son of God is from nothing, or
   created, or alterable, or a work, or from other essence, these the Holy
   Catholic Church anathematizes [904] .' And by saying this, they shewed
   clearly that of the essence,' and one in essence,' are destructive of
   those catchwords of irreligion, such as created,' and work,' and
   originated,' and alterable,' and He was not before His generation.' And
   he who holds these, contradicts the Council; but he who does not hold
   with Arius, must needs hold and intend the decisions of the Council,
   suitably regarding them to signify the relation of the radiance to the
   light, and from thence gaining the illustration of the truth.

   21. Therefore if they, as the others, make an excuse that the terms are
   strange, let them consider the sense in which the Council so wrote, and
   anathematize what the Council anathematized; and then if they can, let
   them find fault with the expressions. But I well know that, if they
   hold the sense of the Council, they will fully accept the terms in
   which it is conveyed; whereas if it be the sense which they wish to
   complain of, all must see that it is idle in them to discuss the
   wording, when they are but seeking handles for irreligion. This then
   was the reason of these expressions; but if they still complain that
   such are not scriptural, that very complaint is a reason why they
   should be cast out, as talking idly and disordered in mind. And let
   them blame themselves in this matter, for they set the example,
   beginning their war against God with words not in Scripture. However,
   if a person is interested in the question, let him know, that, even if
   the expressions are not in so many words in the Scriptures, yet, as was
   said before, they contain the sense of the Scriptures, and expressing
   it, they convey it to those who have their hearing unimpaired for
   religious doctrine. Now this circumstance it is for thee to consider,
   and for those ill-instructed men to give ear to. It has been shewn
   above, and must be believed as true, that the Word is from the Father,
   and the only Offspring [905] proper to Him and natural. For whence may
   one conceive the Son to be, who is the Wisdom and the Word, in whom all
   things came to be, but from God Himself? However, the Scriptures also
   teach us this, since the Father says by David, My heart uttered a good
   Word [906] ,' and, From the womb before the morning star I begat Thee
   [907] ;' and the Son signifies to the Jews about Himself, If God were
   your Father, ye would love Me; for I proceeded forth from the Father
   [908] .' And again; Not that anyone has seen the Father, save He which
   is from God, He hath seen the Father [909] .' And moreover, I and My
   Father are one,' and, I in the Father and the Father in Me [910] ,' is
   equivalent to saying, I am from the Father, and inseparable from Him.'
   And John in saying, The Only-begotten Son which is in the bosom of the
   Father, He hath declared Him, [911] ' spoke of what He had learned from
   the Saviour. Besides, what else does in the bosom' intimate, but the
   Son's genuine generation from the Father?

   22. If then any man conceives God to be compound, as accident [912] is
   in essence, or to have any external envelopement [913] , and to be
   encompassed, or as if there is aught about Him which completes the
   essence, so that when we say God,' or name Father,' we do not signify
   the invisible and incomprehensible essence, but something about it,
   then let them complain of the Council's stating that the Son was from
   the essence of God; but let them reflect, that in thus considering they
   utter two blasphemies; for they make God corporeal, and they falsely
   say that the Lord is not Son of the very Father, but of what is about
   Him. But if God be simple, as He is, it follows that in saying God' and
   naming Father,' we name nothing as if about Him, but signify his
   essence itself. For though to comprehend what the essence of God is be
   impossible, yet if we only understand that God is, and if Scripture
   indicates Him by means of these titles, we, with the intention of
   indicating Him and none else, call Him God and Father and Lord. When
   then He says, I am that I am,' and I am the Lord God [914] ,' or when
   Scripture says, God,' we understand nothing else by it but the
   intimation of His incomprehensible essence Itself, and that He Is, who
   is spoken of [915] . Therefore let no one be startled on hearing that
   the Son of God is from the Essence of the Father; but rather let him
   accept the explanation of the Fathers, who in more explicit but
   equivalent language have for from God' written of the essence.' For
   they considered it the same thing to say that the Word was of God' and
   of the essence of God,' since the word God,' as I have already said,
   signifies nothing but the essence of Him Who Is. If then the Word is
   not in such sense from God, as a son, genuine and natural, from a
   father, but only as creatures because they are framed, and as all
   things are from God,' then neither is He from the essence of the
   Father, nor is the Son again Son according to essence, but in
   consequence of virtue, as we who are called sons by grace. But if He
   only is from God, as a genuine Son, as He is, then the Son may
   reasonably be called from the essence of God.

   23. Again, the illustration of the Light and the Radiance has this
   meaning. For the Saints have not said that the Word was related to God
   as fire kindled from the heat of the sun, which is commonly put out
   again, for this is an external work and a creature of its author, but
   they all preach of Him as Radiance [916] , thereby to signify His being
   from the essence, proper and indivisible, and His oneness with the
   Father. This also will secure His true unchangableness and
   immutability; for how can these be His, unless He be proper Offspring
   of the Father's essence? for this too must be taken to confirm His
   identity with His own Father. Our explanation then having so religious
   an aspect, Christ's enemies should not be startled at the One in
   essence,' either, since this term also has a sound sense and good
   reasons. Indeed, if we say that the Word is from the essence of God
   (for after what has been said this must be a phrase admitted by them),
   what does this mean but the truth and eternity of the essence from
   which He is begotten? for it is not different in kind, lest it be
   combined with the essence of God as something foreign and unlike it.
   Nor is He like only outwardly, lest He seem in some respect or wholly
   to be other in essence, as brass shines like gold and silver like tin.
   For these are foreign and of other nature, are separated off from each
   other in nature and virtues, nor is brass proper to gold, nor is the
   pigeon born from the dove [917] ; but though they are considered like,
   yet they differ in essence. If then it be thus with the Son, let Him be
   a creature as we are, and not One in essence; but if the Son is Word,
   Wisdom, Image of the Father, Radiance, He must in all reason be One in
   essence. For unless it be proved that He is not from God, but an
   instrument different in nature and different in essence, surely the
   Council was sound in its doctrine and correct in its decree [918] .

   24. Further, let every corporeal reference be banished on this subject;
   and transcending every imagination of sense, let us, with pure
   understanding and with mind alone, apprehend the genuine relation of
   son to father, and the Word's proper relation towards God, and the
   unvarying likeness of the radiance towards the light: for as the words
   Offspring' and Son' bear, and are meant to bear, no human sense, but
   one suitable to God, in like manner when we hear the phrase one in
   essence,' let us not fall upon human senses, and imagine partitions and
   divisions of the Godhead, but as having our thoughts directed to things
   immaterial, let us preserve undivided the oneness of nature and the
   identity of light; for this is proper to a son as regards a father, and
   in this is shewn that God is truly Father of the Word. Here again, the
   illustration of light and its radiance is in point [919] . Who will
   presume to say that the radiance is unlike and foreign to the sun?
   rather who, thus considering the radiance relatively to the sun, and
   the identity of the light, would not say with confidence, Truly the
   light and the radiance are one, and the one is manifested in the other,
   and the radiance is in the sun, so that whoso sees this, sees that
   also?' but such a oneness and natural property, what should it be named
   by those who believe and see aright, but Offspring one in essence? and
   God's Offspring what should we fittingly and suitably consider, but
   Word, and Wisdom, and Power? which it were a sin to say was foreign to
   the Father, or a crime even to imagine as other than with Him
   everlastingly. For by this Offspring the Father made all things, and
   extended His Providence unto all things; by Him He exercises His love
   to man, and thus He and the Father are one, as has been said; unless
   indeed these perverse men make a fresh attempt, and say that the
   essence of the Word is not the same as the Light which is in Him from
   the Father, as if the Light in the Son were one with the Father, but He
   Himself foreign in essence as being a creature. Yet this is simply the
   belief of Caiaphas and the Samosatene, which the Church cast out, but
   these now are disguising; and by this they fell from the truth, and
   were declared to be heretics. For if He partakes in fulness the light
   from the Father, why is He not rather that which others partake [920] ,
   that there be no medium introduced between Him and the Father?
   Otherwise, it is no longer clear that all things were generated by the
   Son, but by Him, of whom He too partakes [921] . And if this is the
   Word, the Wisdom of the Father, in whom the Father is revealed and
   known, and frames the world, and without whom the Father doth nothing,
   evidently He it is who is from the Father: for all things originated
   partake of Him, as partaking of the Holy Ghost. And being such, He
   cannot be from nothing, nor a creature at all, but rather a proper
   Offspring from the Father, as the radiance from light.

   [878] By aion, age, seems to be meant duration, or the measure of
   duration, before or independent of the existence of motion, which is in
   measure of time. As motion, and therefore time, are creatures, so are
   the ages. Considered as the measure of duration, an age has a sort of
   positive existence, though not an ousia or substance, and means the
   same as world,' or an existing system of things viewed apart from time
   and motion. Vid. Theodt. in Hebr. i. 2. Our Lord then is the Maker of
   the ages thus considered, as the Apostle also tells us, Hebr. xi. 3.
   and God is the King of the ages, 1 Tim. i. 17. or is before all ages,
   as being eternal, or proaionios. However, sometimes the word is
   synonymous with eternity; as time is to things which are under time, so
   ages to things which are everlasting.' Damasc. Fid. Orth. ii. 1, and
   ages of ages' stands for eternity; and then the ages' or measures of
   duration may be supposed to stand for the ideai or ideas in the Divine
   Mind, which seems to have been a Platonic or Gnostic notion. Hence
   Synesius, Hymn iii. addresses the Almighty as aionotoke, parent of the
   ages. Hence sometimes God Himself is called the Age, Clem. Alex. Hymn.
   PÃ¦d. iii. fin. or, the Age of ages, Pseudo-Dion. de Div. Nom. 5. p.
   580. or again, ai& 240;nios. Theodoret sums up what has been said thus:
   Age is not any subsisting substance, but is an interval indicative of
   time, now infinite, when God is spoken of, now commensurate with
   creation, now with human life.' HÃ¦r. v. 6. If then, as Athan. says in
   the text, the Word is Maker of the ages, He is independent of duration
   altogether; He does not come to be in time, but is above and beyond it,
   or eternal. Elsewhere he says, The words addressed to the Son in the
   144th Psalm, Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all ages,' forbid any one to
   imagine any interval at all in which the Word did not exist. For if
   every interval is measured by ages, and of all the ages the Word is
   King and Maker, therefore, whereas no interval at all exists prior to
   Him, it were madness to say, "There was once when the Everlasting (ai&
   240;nios) was not." Orat. i. 12. And so Alexander; Is it not
   unreasonable that He who made times, and ages, and seasons, to all of
   which belongs was not,' should be said not to be? for, if so, that
   interval in which they say the Son was not yet begotten by the Father,
   precedes that Wisdom of God which framed all things.' Theod. Hist. i.

   [881] Athan. here retorts, as it was obvious to do, the charge brought
   against the Council which gave occasion for this Treatise. If the
   Council went beyond Scripture in the use of the word essence' (which
   however can hardly be granted), who made this necessary, but they who
   had already introduced the phrases, the Son was out of nothing,' &c.,
   &c.? Of the essence,' and one in essence,' were directly intended to
   contradict and supplant the Arian unscriptural innovations, as he says
   below, Â§20. fin. 21. init. vid. also ad Afros. 6. de Synod. Â§36, 37. He

   [886] Hence it stands in the Creed, from the Father, that is, from the
   essence of the Father.' vid. Eusebius's Letter, infr. According to the
   received doctrine of the Church all rational beings, and in one sense
   all beings whatever, are from God,' over and above the fact of their
   creation; and of this truth the Arians made use to deny our Lord's
   proper divinity. Athan. lays down elsewhere that nothing remains in
   consistence and life, except from a participation of the Word, which is
   to be considered a gift from Him, additional to that of creation, and
   separable in idea from it; vid. above, Â§17, note 5. contr. Gent. 42. de
   Incarn. 5. Man thus considered is, in his first estate, a son of God
   and born of God, or, to use the term which occurs so frequently in the
   Arian controversy, in the number, not only of the creatures, but of
   things generate, genneta. This was the sense in which the Arians said
   that our Lord was Son of God; whereas, as Athan. says, things
   originate, being works, cannot be called generate, except so far as,
   after their making, they partake of the begotten Son, and are therefore
   said to have been generated also; not at all in their own nature, but
   because of their participation of the Son in the Spirit.' Orat. i. 56.
   The question then was, as to the distinction of the Son's divine
   generation over that of holy men; and the Catholics answered that He
   was ex ousias, from the essence of God; not by participation of grace,
   not by resemblance, not in a limited sense, but really and simply, and
   therefore by an internal divine act. vid. below, Â§22. and infr. Â§31.

   [889] When characteristic attributes and prerogatives are ascribed to
   God, or to the Father, this is done only to the exclusion of creatures,
   or of false gods, not to the exclusion of His Son who is implied in the
   mention of Himself. Thus when God is called only wise, or the Father
   the only God, or God is said to be unoriginate, agenetos, this is not
   in contrast to the Son, but to all things which are distinct from God.
   vid. Orat. iii. 8. Naz. Orat. 30, 13. Cyril. Thesaur. p 142. The words
   "one" and "only" ascribed to God in Scripture,' says S. Basil, are not
   used in contrast to the Son or the Holy Spirit, but with reference to
   those who are not God, and falsely called so.' Ep. 8. n. 3. On the
   other hand, when the Father is mentioned, the other Divine Persons are
   implied in Him, The Blessed and Holy Trinity,' says S. Athan. is
   indivisible and one in itself; and when the Father is mentioned, His
   Word is added, and the Spirit in the Son; and if the Son is named, in
   the Son is the Father, and the Spirit is not external to the Word.' ad
   Serap. i. 14.

   [890] Vid. also ad Afros. 4. Again, "I am," to on, is really proper to
   God and is a whole, bounded or mutilated neither by aught before Him,
   nor after Him, for He neither was, nor shall be.' Naz. Orat. 30. 18
   fin. Also Cyril Dial. i. p. 392. Damasc. Fid. Orth. i. 9. and the

   however, or, substance' of God, the Council did not mean any thing
   distinct from God, vid. note 3 infr. but God Himself viewed in His
   self-existing nature (vid. Tert. in Hermog, 3.), nay, it expressly
   meant to negative the contrary notion of the Arians, that our Lord was
   from something distinct from God, and in consequence of created
   substance. Moreover the term expresses the idea of God positively, in
   contradistinction to negative epithets, such as infinite, immense,
   eternal, &c. Damasc. Fid. Orthod. i. 4. and as little implies any thing
   distinct from God as those epithets do.

   Letter written by Eusebius of Nicomedia, in which he said, If we call
   Him true Son of the Father and uncreate, then are we granting that He
   is one in essence, homoousion,' determined the Council on the adoption
   of the term. de Fid. iii. n. 125. He had disclaimed of the essence,' in
   his Letter to Paulinus. Theod. Hist. i. 4. Arius, however, had
   disclaimed homoousion already, Epiph. HÃ¦r. 69. 7. It was a word of old
   usage in the Church, as Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea confesses in his Letter,
   infr. Tertullian in Prax. 13 fin. has the translation unius
   substantiÃ¦:' (vid. Lucifer de non Parc. p. 218.) as he has de
   substantia Patris,' in Prax. 4. and Origen perhaps used the word, vid.
   Pamph. Apol. 5. and Theognostus and the two Dionysii, infr. Â§25, 26.
   And before them Clement had spoken of the henosis tes monadikes ousias,
   the union of the single essence,' vid. Le Quien in Damasc. Fid. Orth.
   i. 8. Novatian too has per substantiÃ¦ communionem,' de Trinit. 31.

   [902] The Arians allowed that our Lord was like and the image of the
   Father, but in the sense in which a picture is like the original,
   differing from it in substance and in fact. In this sense they even
   allowed the strong word aparallaktos unvarying [or rather exact] image,
   vid. beginning of Â§20. which had been used by the Catholics (vid.
   Alexander, ap. Theod. Hist. i. 3. p. 740.) as by the Semiarians
   afterwards, who even added the words kat' ousian, or according to
   substance.' Even this strong phrase, however, kat' ousian aparallaktos
   eikon, or aparallaktos homoios, did not appear to the Council an
   adequate safeguard of the doctrine. Athan. notices de Syn. that like'
   applies to qualities rather than to essence, Â§53. Also Basil. Ep. 8. n.
   3. while in itself,' says the same Father, it is frequently used of
   faint similitudes and falling very far short of the original.' Ep. 9.
   n. 3. Accordingly, the Council determined on the word homoousion as
   implying, as the text expresses it, the same in likeness,' tauton te
   homoiosei, that the likeness might not be analogical. vid. the passage

   [905] gennema, offspring; this word is of very frequent occurrence in
   Athan. He speaks of it, Orat. iv. 3. as virtually Scriptural. Yet
   Basil, contr. Eunom. ii. 6-8. explicitly disavows the word, as an
   unscriptural invention of Eunomius. That the Father begat we are taught
   in many places: that the Son is an offspring we never heard up to this
   day, for Scripture says, "unto us a child is born, unto us a son is
   given."' c. 7. He goes on to say that it is fearful to give Him names
   of our own to whom God has given a name which is above every name;' and
   observes that offspring is not the word which even a human father would
   apply to his son, as for instance we read, Child, (teknon,) go into the
   vineyard,' and Who art thou, my son?' moreover that fruits of the earth
   are called offspring (I will not drink of the offspring of this vine'),
   rarely animated things, except indeed in such instances as, O
   generation (offspring) of vipers.' Nyssen defends his brother, contr.
   Eunom. Orat. iii. p 105. In the Arian formula an offspring, but not as
   one of the offsprings,' it is synonymous with work' or creature.' On
   the other hand Epiphanius uses it, e.g. HÃ¦r. 76. n. 8. and Naz. Orat.

   [912] sumbebekos. Cf. Orat. iv. 2. also Orat. i. 36. The text embodies
   the common doctrine of the Fathers. Athenagoras, however, speaks of
   God's goodness as an accident, as colour to the body,' as flame is
   ruddy and the sky blue,' Legat. 24. This, however is but a verbal
   difference, for shortly before he speaks of His being, to ontos on, and
   His unity of nature, to monophues, as in the number of episumbebekota
   auto. Eusebius uses the word sumbebekos in the same way [but see Orat.
   iv. 2, note 8], Demonstr. Evang. iv. 3. And hence S. Cyril, in
   controversy with the Arians, is led by the course of their objections
   to observe, There are cogent reasons for considering these things as
   accidents sumbebekota in God, though they be not.' Thesaur. p. 263.
   vid. the following note.

   [913] peribole, and so de Syn. Â§34. which is very much the same
   passage. Some Fathers, however, seem to say the reverse. E.g. Nazianzen
   says that neither the immateriality of God nor ingenerateness, present
   to us His essence.' Orat. 28. 9. And S. Augustine, arguing on the word
   ingenitus, says, that not every thing which is said to be in God is
   said according to essence.' de Trin. v. 6. And hence, while Athan. in
   the text denies that there are qualities or the like belonging to Him,
   peri auton, it is still common in the Fathers to speak of qualities, as
   in the passage of S. Gregory just cited, in which the words peri theon
   occur. There is no difficulty in reconciling these statements, though
   it would require more words than could be given to it here. Petavius
   has treated the subject fully in his work de Deo. i. 7-11. and
   especially ii. 3. When the Fathers say that there is no difference
   between the divine proprietates' and essence, they speak of the fact,
   considering the Almighty as He is; when they affirm a difference, they
   speak of Him as contemplated by us, who are unable to grasp the idea of
   Him as one and simple, but view His Divine Nature as if in projection
   (if such a word may be used), and thus divided into substance and
   quality as man may be divided into genus and difference.

   [914] Ex. iii. 14, 15.

   [915] In like manner de Synod. Â§34. Also Basil, The essence is not any
   one of things which do not attach, but is the very being of God.'
   contr. Eun. i. 10 fin. The nature of God is no other than Himself, for
   He is simple and uncompounded.' Cyril Thesaur. p. 59. When we say the
   power of the Father, we say nothing else than the essence of the
   Father.' August. de Trin. vii. 6. And so Numenius in Eusebius, Let no
   one deride, if I say that the name of the Immaterial is essence and
   being.' PrÃ¦p. Evang. xi. 10.

   [916] Athan.'s ordinary illustration is, as here, not from fire,' but
   from radiance,' apaugasma, after S. Paul [i.e. Hebrews] and the Author
   of the Book of Wisdom, meaning by radiance the light which a light
   diffuses by means of the atmosphere. On the other hand Arius in his
   letter to Alexander, Epiph. HÃ¦r. 69. 7. speaks against the doctrine of
   Hieracas that the Son was from the Father as a light from a light or as
   a lamp divided into two, which after all was Arian doctrine. Athanasius
   refers to fire, Orat. iv. Â§2 and 10, but still to fire and its
   radiance. However we find the illustration of fire from fire, Justin.
   Tryph. 61. Tatian contr. GrÃ¦c. 5. At this early day the illustration of
   radiance might have a Sabellian bearing, as that of fire in Athan.'s
   had an Arian. Hence Justin protests against those who considered the
   Son as like the sun's light in the heaven,' which when it sets, goes
   away with it,' whereas it is as fire kindled from fire.' Tryph. 128.
   Athenagoras, however, like Athanasius, says as light from fire,' using
   also the word apo& 207;rhoia, effluence: vid. also Orig. Periarch. i.
   2. n. 4. Tertull. Ap. 21. Theognostus, quoted infr. Â§25.

   [917] vid. de Syn. Â§41.

   [918] As of the essence' declared that our Lord was uncreate, so one in
   essence' declared that He was equal with the Father; no term derived
   from likeness,' even like in essence' answering for this purpose, for
   such phrases might all be understood of resemblance or representation.
   vid. Â§20, notes 8, 9.

   [919] Athan. has just used the illustration of radiance in reference to
   of the essence:' and now he says that it equally illustrates one in
   essence;' the light diffused from the sun being at once contemporaneous
   and homogeneous with its original.

   [920] Vid. Â§10 init. note 4.

   [921] The point in which perhaps all the ancient heresies concerning
   our Lord's divine nature agreed, was in considering His different
   titles to be those of different beings or subjects, or not really and
   properly to belong to one and the same person; so that the Word was not
   the Son, or the Radiance not the Word, or our Lord was the Son, but
   only improperly the Word, not the true Word, Wisdom, or Radiance. Paul
   of Samosata, Sabellius [?], and Arius, agreed in considering that the
   Son was a creature, and that He was called, made after, or inhabited by
   the impersonal attribute called the Word or Wisdom. When the Word or
   Wisdom was held to be personal, it became the doctrine of Nestorius.

   Dionysius of Alexandria; Dionysius of Rome; Origen.

   25. This then is the sense in which they who met at NicÃ¦a made use of
   these expressions. But next that they did not invent them for
   themselves (since this is one of their excuses), but spoke what they
   had received from their predecessors, proceed we to prove this also, to
   cut off even this excuse from them. Know then, O Arians, foes of
   Christ, that Theognostus [922] , a learned man, did not decline the
   phrase of the essence,' for in the second book of his Hypotyposes, he
   writes thus of the Son:--

   "The essence of the Son is not one procured from without, nor accruing
   out of nothing [923] , but it sprang from the Father's essence, as the
   radiance of light, as the vapour [924] of water; for neither the
   radiance, nor the vapour, is the water itself or the sun itself, nor is
   it alien; but it is an effluence of the Father's essence, which,
   however, suffers no partition. For as the sun remains the same, and is
   not impaired by the rays poured forth by it, so neither does the
   Father's essence suffer change, though it has the Son as an Image of
   Itself [925] ."

   Theognostus then, after previously investigating in the way of an
   exercise [926] , proceeds to lay down his sentiments in the foregoing
   words. Next, Dionysius, who was Bishop of Alexandria, upon his writing
   against Sabellius and expounding at large the Saviour's Economy
   according to the flesh, and thence proving against the Sabellians that
   not the Father but His Word became flesh, as John has said, was
   suspected of saying that the Son as a thing made and originated, and
   not one in essence with the Father; on this he writes to his namesake
   Dionysius, Bishop of Rome, to allege in his defence that this was a
   slander upon him. And he assured him that he had not called the Son
   made, nay, did confess Him to be even one in essence. And his words ran
   thus:--

   "And I have written in another letter a refutation of the false charge
   they bring against me, that I deny that Christ was one in essence with
   God. For though I say that I have not found this term anywhere in Holy
   Scripture, yet my remarks which follow, and which they have not
   noticed, are not inconsistent with that belief. For I instanced human
   birth as being evidently homogeneous, and I observed that undeniably
   parents differed from their children only in not being the same
   individuals, otherwise there could be neither parents nor children. And
   my letter, as I said before, owing to present circumstances I am unable
   to produce; or I would have sent you the very words I used, or rather a
   copy of it all, which, if I have an opportunity, I will do still. But I
   am sure from recollection that I adduced parallels of things kindred
   with each other; for instance, that a plant grown from seed or from
   root, was other than that from which it sprang, yet was altogether one
   in nature with it [927] : and that a stream flowing from a fountain,
   gained a new name, for that neither the fountain was called stream, nor
   the stream fountain, and both existed, and the stream was the water
   from the fountain"

   26. And that the Word of God is not a work or creature, but an
   offspring proper to the Father's essence and indivisible, as the great
   Council wrote, here you may see in the words of Dionysius, Bishop of
   Rome, who, while writing against the Sabellians, thus inveighs against
   those who dared to say so:--

   "Next, I may reasonably turn to those who divide and cut to pieces and
   destroy that most sacred doctrine of the Church of God, the Divine
   Monarchy [928] , making it as it were three powers and partitive
   subsistences [929] and god-heads three. I am told that some among you
   who are catechists and teachers of the Divine Word, take the lead in
   this tenet, who are diametrically opposed, so to speak, to Sabellius's
   opinions; for he blasphemously says that the Son is the Father, and the
   Father the Son, but they in some sort preach three Gods, as dividing
   the sacred Monad into three subsistences foreign to each other and
   utterly separate. For it must needs be that with the God of the
   Universe, the Divine Word is united, and the Holy Ghost must repose
   [930] and habitate in God; thus in one as in a summit, I mean the God
   of the Universe, must the Divine Triad [931] be gathered up and brought
   together. For it is the doctrine of the presumptuous Marcion, to sever
   and divide the Divine Monarchy into three origins,--a devil's teaching,
   not that of Christ's true disciples and lovers of the Saviour's
   lessons. For they know well that a Triad is preached by divine
   Scripture, but that neither Old Testament nor New preaches three Gods.
   Equally must one censure those who hold the Son to be a work, and
   consider that the Lord has come into being, as one of things which
   really came to be; whereas the divine oracles witness to a generation
   suitable to Him and becoming, but not to any fashioning or making. A
   blasphemy then is it, not ordinary, but even the highest, to say that
   the Lord is in any sort a handiwork. For if He came to be Son, once He
   was not; but He was always, if (that is) He be in the Father, as He
   says Himself, and if the Christ be Word and Wisdom and Power (which, as
   ye know, divine Scripture says), and these attributes be powers of God.
   If then the Son came into being, once these attributes were not;
   consequently there was a time, when God was without them; which is most
   absurd. And why say more on these points to you, men full of the Spirit
   and well aware of the absurdities which come to view from saying that
   the Son is a work? Not attending, as I consider, to this circumstance,
   the authors of this opinion have entirely missed the truth, in
   explaining, contrary to the sense of divine and prophetic Scripture in
   the passage, the words, The Lord created me a beginning of His ways
   unto His works [932] .' For the sense of He created,' as ye know, is
   not one, for we must understand He created' in this place, as He set
   over the works made by Him,' that is, made by the Son Himself.' And He
   created' here must not be taken for made,' for creating differs from
   making. Is not He thy Father that hath bought thee? hath He not made
   thee and created thee [933] ?'says Moses in his great song in
   Deuteronomy. And one may say to them, O reckless men, is He a work, who
   is the First-born of every creature, who is born from the womb before
   the morning star [934] ,' who said, as Wisdom, Before all the hills He
   begets me [935] ?' And in many passages of the divine oracles is the
   Son said to have been [936] generated, but nowhere to have [937] come
   into being; which manifestly convicts those of misconception about the
   Lord's generation, who presume to call His divine and ineffable
   generation a making [938] . Neither then may we divide into three
   Godheads the wonderful and divine Monad; nor disparage with the name of
   work' the dignity and exceeding majesty of the Lord; but we must
   believe in God the Father Almighty, and in Christ Jesus His Son, and in
   the Holy Ghost, and hold that to the God of the universe the Word is
   united [939] . For I,' says He, and the Father are one;' and, I in the
   Father and the Father in Me.' For thus both the Divine Triad, and the
   holy preaching of the Monarchy, will be preserved."

   27. And concerning the everlasting co-existence of the Word with the
   Father, and that He is not of another essence or subsistence, but
   proper to the Father's, as the Bishops in the Council said, you may
   hear again from the labour-loving [940] Origen also. For what he has
   written as if inquiring and by way of exercise, that let no one take as
   expressive of his own sentiments, but of parties who are contending in
   investigation, but what he [941] definitely declares, that is the
   sentiment of the labour-loving man. After his prolusions then (so to
   speak) against the heretics, straightway he introduces his personal
   belief, thus:--

   "If there be an Image of the Invisible God, it is an invisible Image;
   nay, I will be bold to add, that, as being the likeness of the Father,
   never was it not. For when was that God, who, according to John, is
   called Light (for God is Light'), without a radiance of His proper
   glory, that a man should presume to assert the Son's origin of
   existence, as if before He was not? But when was not that Image of the
   Father's Ineffable and Nameless and Unutterable subsistence, that
   Expression and Word, and He that knows the Father? for let him
   understand well who dares to say, Once the Son was not,' that he is
   saying, Once Wisdom was not,' and Word was not,' and Life was not.'"

   And again elsewhere he says:--

   "But it is not innocent nor without peril, if because of our weakness
   of understanding we deprive God, as far as in us lies, of the
   Only-begotten Word ever co-existing with Him; and the Wisdom in which
   He rejoiced; else He must be conceived as not always possessed of joy."

   See, we are proving that this view has been transmitted from father to
   father; but ye, O modern Jews and disciples of Caiaphas, how many
   fathers can ye assign to your phrases? Not one of the understanding and
   wise; for all abhor you, but the devil alone [942] ; none but he is
   your father in this apostasy, who both in the beginning sowed you with
   the seed of this irreligion, and now persuades you to slander the
   Ecumenical Council [943] , for committing to writing, not your
   doctrines, but that which from the beginning those who were
   eye-witnesses and ministers of the Word have handed down to us [944] .
   For the faith which the Council has confessed in writing, that is the
   faith of the Catholic Church; to assert this, the blessed Fathers so
   expressed themselves while condemning the Arian heresy; and this is a
   chief reason why these apply themselves to calumniate the Council. For
   it is not the terms which trouble them [945] , but that those terms
   prove them to be heretics, and presumptuous beyond other heresies.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [922] Athanasius elsewhere calls him the admirable and excellent.' ad
   Serap. iv. 9. He was Master of the Catechetical school of Alexandria
   towards the end of the third century, being a scholar, or at least a
   follower of Origen. His seven books of Hypotyposes treated of the Holy
   Trinity, of angels, and evil spirits, of the Incarnation, and the
   Creation. Photius, who gives this account, Cod. 106, accuses him of
   heterodoxy on these points; which Athanasius in a measure admits, as
   far as the wording of his treatise went, when he speaks of his
   investigating by way of exercise.' Eusebius does not mention him at
   all. [His remains in Routh, Rell. iii. 409-414.]

   [923] Vid. above Â§15. fin. God was alone,' says Tertullian, because
   there was nothing external to Him, extrinsecus; yet not even then
   alone, for He had with Him, what He had in Himself, His Reason.' in
   Prax. 5. Non per adoptionem spiritus filius fit extrinsecus, sed naturÃ¢
   filius est. Origen. Periarch. i. 2. n. 4.

   [924] From Wisdom vii. 25. and so Origen, Periarch. i. 2. n. 5. and 9.
   and Athan. de Sent. Dionys. 15.

   [925] It is sometimes erroneously supposed that such illustrations as
   this are intended to explain how the Sacred Mystery in question is
   possible, whereas they are merely intended to shew that the words we
   use concerning it are not self-contradictory, which is the objection
   most commonly brought against them. To say that the doctrine of the
   Son's generation does not intrench upon the Father's perfection and
   immutability, or negative the Son's eternity, seems at first sight
   inconsistent with what the words Father and Son mean, till another
   image is adduced, such as the sun and radiance, in which that alleged
   inconsistency is seen to exist in fact. Here one image corrects
   another; and the accumulation of images is not, as is often thought,
   the restless and fruitless effort of the mind to enter into the
   Mystery, but is a safeguard against any one image, nay, any collection
   of images being supposed sufficient. If it be said that the language
   used concerning the sun and its radiance is but popular not
   philosophical, so again the Catholic language concerning the Holy
   Trinity may, nay must be, economical, not adequate, conveying the
   truth, not in the tongues of angels, but under human modes of thought
   and speech.

   [926] en gumnasi& 139; exetasas. And so Â§27. of Origen, xeton kai
   gumnazon. Constantine too, writing to Alexander and Arius, speaks of
   altercation, phusikes tinos gumnasias heneka. Socr. i. 7. In somewhat a
   similar way, Athanasius speaks of Dionysius writing kat' oikonomian,
   economically, or with reference to certain persons addressed or objects
   contemplated, de Sent. D. 6. and 26.

   [927] The Arians at NicÃ¦a objected to this image, Socr. i. 8. as
   implying that the Son was a probole, issue or development, as
   Valentinus taught. Epiph. HÃ¦r. 69. 7. Athanasius elsewhere uses it
   himself.

   [928] By the Monarchy is meant the doctrine that the Second and Third
   Persons in the Ever-blessed Trinity are ever to be referred in our
   thoughts to the First as the Fountain of Godhead, vid. Â§15. note 9, and
   Â§19, note 6. It is one of the especial senses in which God is said to
   be one. Cf. Orat. iii. Â§15. vid. also iv. Â§1. The Father is union,
   henosis,' says S. Greg. Naz. from whom and unto whom are the others.'
   Orat. 42. 15. also Orat. 20. 7. and Epiph. HÃ¦r. 57. 5. Tertullian,
   before Dionysius, uses the word Monarchia, which Praxeas had perverted
   into a kind of Unitarianism or Sabellianism, in Prax. 3. IrenÃ¦us too
   wrote on the Monarchy, i.e. against the doctrine that God is the author
   of evil. Eus. Hist. v. 20. [see S. Iren. fragment 33, Ante-Nic. Lib.]
   And before him was Justin's work de Monarchia, where the word is used
   in opposition to Polytheism. The Marcionites, whom Dionysius presently
   mentions, are also specified in the above extract by Athan. vid. also
   Cyril. Hier. Cat. xvi. 3. Epiphanius says that their three origins were
   God, the Creator, and the evil spirit. HÃ¦r. 42, 3. or as Augustine
   says, the good, the just, and the wicked, which may be taken to mean
   nearly the same thing. HÃ¦r. 22. The Apostolical Canons denounce those
   who baptize into Three Unoriginate; vid. also Athan. Tom. ad Antioch.
   5. Naz. Orat. 20. 6. Basil denies treis archikai hupostaseis, de Sp. S.
   38. which is a Platonic phrase.

   [929] And so Dionysius Alex. in a fragment preserved by S. Basil, If
   because the subsistences are three, they say that they are partitive,
   memerismenas, still three there are, though these persons dissent, or
   they utterly destroy the Divine Trinity.' de Sp. S. n. 72. Athan.
   expresses the same more distinctly, ou treis hupostaseis memerismenas,
   Expos. Fid. Â§2. In S. Greg. Naz. we find ameristos en memerismenois he
   theotes. Orat. 31. 14. Elsewhere for mem. he substitutes aper&
   191;egmenas. Orat. 20. 6. apexenomenas allelon kai diespasmenas. Orat.
   23. 6. as infr. xenas allelon pantapasi kechorismenas. The passage in
   the text comes into question in the controversy about the ex
   hupostaseos e ousias of the Nicene Creed, of which infr. on the Creed
   itself in Eusebius's Letter.

   [930] emphilochorein

   [931] The word trias, usually translated Trinity, is first used by
   Theophilus, ad Autol. ii. 15. Gibbon remarks that the doctrine of a
   numerical rather than a generical unity,' which has been explicitly put
   forth by the Latin Church, is favoured by the Latin language; trias
   seems to excite the idea of substance, trinitas of qualities.' ch. 21.
   note 74. It is certain that the Latin view of the sacred truth, when
   perverted, becomes Sabellianism; and that the Greek, when perverted,
   becomes Arianism; and we find Arius arising in the East, Sabellius in
   the West. It is also certain that the word Trinitas is properly
   abstract; and expresses trias or a three,' only in an ecclesiastical
   sense. But Gibbon does not seem to observe that Unitas is abstract as
   well as Trinitas; and that we might just as well say in consequence,
   that the Latins held an abstract unity or a unity of qualities, while
   the Greeks by monas taught the doctrine of a one' or a numerical unity.
   Singularitatem hanc dico (says S. Ambrose), quod GrÃ¦ce monotes dicitur;
   singularitas ad personam pertinet, unitas ad naturam.' de Fid. v. 1. It
   is important, however, to understand, that Trinity' does not mean the
   state or condition of being three, as humanity is the condition of
   being man, but is synonymous with three persons. Humanity does not
   exist and cannot be addressed, but the Holy Trinity is a three, or a
   unity which exists in three. Apparently from not considering this,
   Luther and Calvin objected to the word Trinity, It is a common prayer,'
   says Calvin: Holy Trinity, one God, have mercy on us. It displeases me,
   and savours throughout of barbarism.' Ep. ad Polon. p. 796.

   [939] This extract discloses to us (in connexion with the passages from
   Dionysius Alex. here and in the de Sent. D.) a remarkable anticipation
   of the Arian controversy in the third century. 1. It appears that the
   very symbol of en hote ouk en, once He was not,' was asserted or
   implied; vid. also the following extract from Origen, Â§27. and Origen
   Periarchon, iv. 28. where mention is also made of the ex ouk onton, out
   of nothing,' which was the Arian symbol in opposition to of the
   substance.' Allusions are made besides, to the Father not being always
   Father,' de Sent. D. 15. and the Word being brought to be by the true
   Word, and Wisdom by the true Wisdom;' ibid. 25. 2. The same special
   text is used in defence of the heresy, and that not at first sight an
   obvious one, which is found among the Arians, Prov. viii. 22. 3. The
   same texts were used by the Catholics, which occur in the Arian
   controversy. e.g. Deut. xxxii. 6. against Prov. viii. 22. and such as
   Ps. cx. 3. Prov. viii. 25. and the two John x. 30. and xiv. 10. 4. The
   same Catholic symbols and statements are found, e.g. begotten not
   made,' one in essence,' Trinity,' adiaireton, anarchon, aeigenes, light
   from light,' &c. Much might be said on this circumstance, as forming
   part of the proof of the very early date of the development and
   formation of the Catholic theology, which we are at first sight apt to
   ascribe to the 4th and 5th centuries. [But see Introd. to de Sent.

   opening of its Synodical Letter.

   [944] The profession under which the decrees of Councils come to us is
   that of setting forth in writing what has ever been held orally or
   implicitly in the Church. Hence the frequent use of such phrases as
   engraphos exetethe with reference to them. Thus Damasus, Theod. H. E.
   v. 10. speaks of that apostolical faith, which was set forth in writing
   by the Fathers in NicÃ¦a.' On the other hand, Ephrem of Antioch speaks
   of the doctrine of our Lord's perfect humanity being inculcated by our
   Holy Fathers, but not as yet [i.e. till the Council of Chalcedon] being
   confirmed by the decree of an ecumenical Council.' Phot. 229. p. 801.
   (engraphos, however, sometimes relates to the act of subscribing; Phot.
   ibid. or to Scripture, Clement. Strom. i. init. p. 321.) Hence Athan.
   says ad Afros. 1. and 2. that the Word of the Lord which was given
   through the ecumenical Council in NicÃ¦a remaineth for ever;' and uses
   against its opposers the texts, Remove not the ancient landmark which
   thy fathers have set' (vid. also Dionysius in Eus. H. E. vii. 7.), and
   He that curseth his father or his mother, shall surely be put to
   death.' Prov. xxii. 28. Ex. xxi. 17. vid. also Athan. ad Epict. 1. And
   the Council of Chalcedon professes to drive away the doctrines of error
   by a common decree, and renew the unswerving faith of the Fathers,'
   Act. v. p. 452. [t. iv. 1453 ed. Col.] as,' they proceed, from of old
   the prophets spoke of Christ, and He Himself instructed us, and the
   creed of the Fathers has delivered to us,' whereas other faith it is
   not lawful for any to bring forth, or to write, or to draw up, or to
   hold, or to teach.' p. 456. [1460 ed. Col.] vid. S. Leo. supr. p. 5.
   note m. This, however, did not interfere with their adding without
   undoing. For,' says Vigilius, if it were unlawful to receive aught
   further after the Nicene statutes, on what authority venture we to
   assert that the Holy Ghost is of one substance with the Father, which
   it is notorious was there omitted?' contr. Eutych. v. init.; he gives
   other instances, some in point, others not. vid. also Eulogius, apud
   Phot. Cod. 23. pp. 829. 853. Yet to add to the confession of the Church
   is not to add to the faith, since nothing can be added to the faith.
   Leo, Ep. 124. p. 1237. Nay, Athan. says that the Nicene faith is
   sufficient to refute every heresy, ad Max. 5. fin. (also Leo. Ep. 54.
   p. 956. and Naz. Ep. 102. init.) excepting, however, the doctrine of
   the Holy Spirit; which explains his meaning. The Henoticon of Zeno says
   the same, but with the intention of dealing a blow at the Council of
   Chalcedon. Evagr. iii. 14. p. 345. Aetius at Chalcedon says that at
   Ephesus and Chalcedon the Fathers did not profess to draw up an
   exposition of faith, and that Cyril and Leo did but interpret the
   Creed. Conc. t. 2. p. 428. [t. iv. 1430, 1431 ed. Col. See this whole
   subject very amply treated in Dr. Pusey's On the Clause, And the Son,
   pp. 76 sqq.] Leo even says that the Apostles' Creed is sufficient
   against all heresies, and that Eutyches erred on a point of which our
   Lord wished no one of either sex in the Church to be ignorant,' and he
   wishes Eutyches to take the plentitude of the Creed puro et simplici
   corde.' Ep. 31. p. 857, 8.

   [945] Supr. Â§21. init.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter VII.--On the Arian Symbol "Unoriginate." This term afterwards
   adopted by them; and why; three senses of it. A fourth sense.
   Unoriginate denotes God in contrast to His creatures, not to His Son;
   Father the scriptural title instead; Conclusion.

   28. This in fact was the reason, when the unsound nature of their
   phrases had been exposed at that time, and they were henceforth open to
   the charge of irreligion, that they proceeded to borrow of the Greeks
   the term Unoriginate [946] , that, under shelter of it, they might
   reckon among the things originated and the creatures, that Word of God,
   by whom these very things came to be; so unblushing are they in their
   irreligion, so obstinate in their blasphemies against the Lord. If then
   this want of shame arises from ignorance of the term, they ought to
   have learned of those who gave it them, and who have not scrupled to
   say that even intellect, which they derive from Good, and the soul
   which proceeds from intellect, though their respective origins be
   known, are notwithstanding unoriginated, for they understand that by so
   saying they do not disparage that first Origin of which the others come
   [947] . This being the case, let them say the like themselves, or else
   not speak at all of what they do not know. But if they consider they
   are acquainted with the subject, then they must be interrogated; for
   [948] the expression is not from divine Scripture [949] , but they are
   contentious, as elsewhere, for unscriptural positions. Just as I have
   related the reason and sense, with which the Council and the Fathers
   before it defined and published of the essence,' and one in essence,'
   agreeably to what Scripture says of the Saviour; so now let them, if
   they can, answer on their part what has led them to this unscriptural
   phrase, and in what sense they call God Unoriginated? In truth, I am
   told [950] , that the name has different senses; philosophers say that
   it means, first what has not yet, but may, come to be;' next, what
   neither exists, nor can come into being;' and thirdly, what exists
   indeed, but was neither originated nor had origin of being, but is
   everlasting and indestructible [951] .' Now perhaps they will wish to
   pass over the first two senses, from the absurdity which follows; for
   according to the first, things that already have come to be, and things
   that are expected to come to be, are unoriginated; and the second is
   more absurd still; accordingly they will proceed to the third sense,
   and use the word in it; though here, in this sense too, their
   irreligion will be quite as great. For if by unoriginated they mean
   what has no origin of being, nor is originated or created, but eternal,
   and say that the Word of God is contrary to this, who comprehends not
   the craft of these foes of God? who but would stone [952] such madmen?
   for, when they are ashamed to bring forward again those first phrases
   which they fabled, and which were condemned, the wretches have taken
   another way to signify them, by means of what they call unoriginate.
   For if the Son be of things originate, it follows, that He too came to
   be from nothing; and if He has an origin of being, then He was not
   before His generation; and if He is not eternal, there was once when He
   was not [953] .

   29. If these are their sentiments they ought to signify their
   heterodoxy in their own phrases, and not to hide their perverseness
   under the cloke of the Unoriginate. But instead of this, the
   evil-minded men do all things with craftiness like their father, the
   devil; for as he attempts to deceive in the guise of others, so these
   have broached the term Unoriginate, that they might pretend to speak
   piously of God, yet might cherish a concealed blasphemy against the
   Lord, and under a veil might teach it to others. However, on the
   detecting of this sophism, what remains to them? We have found
   another,' say the evildoers; and then proceed to add to what they have
   said already, that Unoriginate means what has no author of being, but
   stands itself in this relation to things originated. Unthankful, and in
   truth deaf to the Scriptures! who do everything, and say everything,
   not to honour God, but to dishonour the Son, ignorant that he who
   dishonours the Son, dishonours the Father. For first, even though they
   denote God in this way, still the Word is not proved to be of things
   originated. For again, as being an offspring of the essence of the
   Father, He is of consequence with Him eternally. For this name of
   offspring does not detract from the nature of the Word, nor does
   Unoriginated take its sense from contrast with the Son, but with the
   things which come to be through the Son; and as he who addresses an
   architect, and calls him framer of house or city, does not under this
   designation allude to the son who is begotten from him, but on account
   of the art and science which he displays in his work, calls him
   artificer, signifying thereby that he is not such as the things made by
   him, and while he knows the nature of the builder, knows also that he
   whom he begets is other than his works; and in regard to his son calls
   him father, but in regard to his works, creator and maker; in like
   manner he who says in this sense that God is unoriginate, names Him
   from His works, signifying, not only that He is not originated, but
   that He is maker of things which are so; yet is aware withal that the
   Word is other than the things originate, and alone a proper offspring
   of the Father, through whom all things came to be and consist [954] .

   30. In like manner, when the Prophets spoke of God as All-ruling, they
   did not so name Him, as if the Word were included in that All; (for
   they knew that the Son was other than things originated, and Sovereign
   over them Himself, according to His likeness to the Father); but
   because He is Ruler over all things which through the Son He has made,
   and has given the authority of all things to the Son, and having given
   it, is Himself once more the Lord of all things through the Word.
   Again, when they called God, Lord of the powers [955] , they said not
   this as if the Word was one of those powers, but because while He is
   Father of the Son, He is Lord of the powers which through the Son have
   come to be. For again, the Word too, as being in the Father, is Lord of
   them all, and Sovereign over all; for all things, whatsoever the Father
   hath, are the Son's. This then being the force of such titles, in like
   manner let a man call God unoriginated, if it so please him; not
   however as if the Word were of originated things, but because, as I
   said before, God not only is not originated, but through His proper
   Word is He the maker of things which are so. For though the Father be
   called such, still the Word is the Father's Image, and one in essence
   with Him; and being His Image, He must be distinct from things
   originated, and from everything; for whose Image He is, His property
   and likeness He hath: so that he who calls the Father unoriginated and
   almighty, perceives in the Unoriginated and the Almighty, His Word and
   His Wisdom, which is the Son. But these wondrous men, and prompt for
   irreligion, hit upon the term Unoriginated, not as caring for God's
   honour, but from malevolence towards the Saviour; for if they had
   regard to honour and reverent language, it rather had been right and
   good to acknowledge and to call God Father, than to give Him this name;
   for in calling God unoriginated, they are, as I said before, calling
   Him from things which came to be, and as a Maker only, that so they may
   imply the Word to be a work after their own pleasure; but he who calls
   God Father, in Him withal signifies His Son also, and cannot fail to
   know that, whereas there is a Son, through this Son all things that
   came to be were created.

   31. Therefore it will be much more accurate to denote God from the Son
   and to call Him Father, than to name Him and call Him Unoriginated from
   His works only; for the latter term refers to the works that have come
   to be at the will of God through the Word, but the name of Father
   points out the proper offspring from His essence. And whereas the Word
   surpasses things originated, by so much and more also doth calling God
   Father surpass the calling Him Unoriginated; for the latter is
   non-scriptural and suspicious, as it has various senses; but the former
   is simple and scriptural, and more accurate, and alone implies the Son.
   And Unoriginated' is a word of the Greeks who know not the Son: but
   Father' has been acknowledged and vouchsafed by our Lord; for He
   knowing Himself whose Son He was, said, I in the Father and the Father
   in Me [956] ;' and, He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father;' and, I
   and the Father are one [957] ;' but nowhere is He found to call the
   Father Unoriginated. Moreover, when He teaches us to pray, He says not,
   When ye pray, say, O God Unoriginated,' but rather, When ye pray, say,
   Our Father, which art in heaven [958] .' And it was His Will, that the
   Summary of our faith should have the same bearing. For He has bid us be
   baptized, not in the name of Unoriginate and Originate, not into the
   name of Uncreate and Creature, but into the name of Father, Son, and
   Holy Spirit [959] , for with such an initiation we too are made sons
   verily [960] , and using the name of the Father, we acknowledge from
   that name the Word in the Father. But if He wills that we should call
   His own Father our Father, we must not on that account measure
   ourselves with the Son according to nature, for it is because of the
   Son that the Father is so called by us; for since the Word bore our
   body and came to be in us, therefore by reason of the Word in us, is
   God called our Father. For the Spirit of the Word in us names through
   us His own Father as ours, which is the Apostle's meaning when he says,
   God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying,
   Abba, Father [961] .'

   32. But perhaps being refuted as touching the term Unoriginate also,
   they will say according to their evil nature, It behoved, as regards
   our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ also, to state from the Scriptures
   what is there written of Him, and not to introduce non-scriptural
   expressions.' Yes, it behoved, say I too; for the tokens of truth are
   more exact as drawn from Scripture, than from other sources [962] ; but
   the ill disposition and the versatile and crafty irreligion of Eusebius
   and his fellows, compelled the Bishops, as I said before, to publish
   more distinctly the terms which overthrew their irreligion; and what
   the Council did write has already been shewn to have an orthodox sense,
   while the Arians have been shewn to be corrupt in their phrases, and
   evil in their dispositions. The term Unoriginate, having its own sense,
   and admitting of a religious use, they nevertheless, according to their
   own idea, and as they will, use for the dishonour of the Saviour, all
   for the sake of contentiously maintaining, like giants [963] , their
   fight with God. But as they did not escape condemnation when they
   adduced these former phrases, so when they misconceive of the
   Unoriginated which in itself admits of being used well and religiously,
   they were detected, being disgraced before all, and their heresy
   everywhere proscribed. This then, as I could, have I related, by way of
   explaining what was formerly done in the Council; but I know that the
   contentious among Christ's foes will not be disposed to change even
   after hearing this, but will ever search about for other pretences, and
   for others again after those. For as the Prophet speaks, If the
   Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots [964] ', then will
   they be willing to think religiously, who have been instructed in
   irreligion. Thou however, beloved, on receiving this, read it by
   thyself; and if thou approvest of it, read it also to the brethren who
   happen to be present, that they too on hearing it, may welcome the
   Council's zeal for the truth, and the exactness of its sense; and may
   condemn that of Christ's foes, the Arians, and the futile pretences,
   which for the sake of their irreligious heresy they have been at the
   pains to frame among themselves; because to God and the Father is due
   the glory, honour, and worship with His co-existent Son and Word,
   together with the All-holy and Life-giving Spirit, now and unto endless
   ages of ages. Amen.

   [946] ageneton. Opportunity will occur for noticing this celebrated
   word on Orat. i. 30-34. where the present passage is partly rewritten,
   partly transcribed. Mention is also made of it in the De Syn. 46, 47.
   Athanasius would seem to have been but partially acquainted with the
   writings of the Anomoeans, whose symbol it was, and to have argued with
   them from the writings of the elder Arians, who had also made use of
   it. [On Newman's unfortunate confusion of ageneton and agenneton, see
   Lightfoot, as quoted in the note on Exp. Fid. Â§1. Newman's reasons are
   stated in note 7 to Orat. i. 56.]

   [947] Montfaucon quotes a passage from Plato's PhÃ¦drus, in which the
   human soul is called unoriginate and immortal [246 a.];' but Athan. is
   referring to another subject, the Platonic, or rather the Eclectic
   [i.e. Neo-Platonic] Trinity. Thus Theodoret, Plotinus, and Numenius,
   explaining the sense of Plato, say, that he taught Three principles
   beyond time and eternal, Good, Intellect, and the Soul of all,' de
   Affect. Cur. ii. p. 750. And so Plotinus himself, It is as if one were
   to place Good as the centre, Intellect like an immoveable circle round,
   and Soul a moveable circle, and moveable by appetite.' 4 Ennead. iv. c.
   16. vid. Porphyry in Cyril. contr. Julian. viii. t. ult. p. 271. vid.
   ibid. i. p. 32. Plot. 3 Ennead. v. 2 and 3. Athan.'s testimony that the
   Platonists considered their three hupostaseis all unoriginate is
   perhaps a singular one. In 5 Ennead. iv. 1. Plotinus says what seems
   contrary to it, he de arche agennetos, speaking of his tagathon. Yet
   Plato, quoted by Theodoret, ibid. p. 749, speaks of eite archen eite
   archas.

   [948] epei malistai, hoti malista, Orat. 1. Â§36. de Syn. Â§21. fin.
   hotan malista, Apol. ad Const. 23. kai malista, de Syn. Â§42, 54.

   [949] Cf. Â§18, n. 8.

   [950] And so de Syn. Â§46. we have on careful inquiry ascertained, &c.'
   Again, I have acquainted myself on their account [the Arians'] with the
   meaning of ageneton.' Orat. i. Â§30. This is remarkable, for Athan. was
   a man of liberal education, as his Orat. contr. Gent. and de Incarn.
   shew, especially, his acquaintance with the Platonic philosophy.
   Sulpicius too speaks of him as a jurisconsultus, Sacr. Hist. ii. 50. S.
   Gregory Naz. says, that he gave some attention, but not much, to the
   subjects of general education, ton enkuklion, that he might not be
   altogether ignorant, of what he nevertheless despised, Orat. 21. 6. In
   the same way S. Basil, whose cultivation of mind none can doubt, speaks
   slightingly of his own philosophical knowledge. He writes of his
   neglecting his own weakness, and being utterly unexercised in such
   disquisitions;' contr. Eunom. init. And so in de Sp. Â§5. he says, that
   they who have given time' to vain philosophy, divide causes into
   principal, cooperative,' &c. Elsewhere he speaks of having expended
   much time on vanity, and wasted nearly all his youth in the vain labour
   of pursuing the studies of that wisdom which God has made foolishness,'
   Ep. 223. 2. In truth, Christianity has a philosophy of its own. Thus in
   the commencement of his ViÃ¦ Dux Anastasius says, It is a first point to
   be understood, that the tradition of the Catholic Church does not
   proceed upon, or follow, the philosophical definitions in all respects,
   and especially as regards the mystery of Christ, and the doctrine of
   the Trinity, but a certain rule of its own, evangelical and
   apostolical.' p. 20.

   [951] Four senses of ageneton are enumerated, Orat. i. Â§30. 1. What is
   not as yet, but is possible; 2. what neither has been nor can be; 3.
   what exists, but has not come to be from any cause; 4. what is not
   made, but is ever. Only two senses are specified in the de Syn. Â§46.
   and in these the question really lies; 1. what is, but without a cause;
   2. uncreate.

   [952] Ballesthosan para panton, Orat. ii. Â§28. An apparent allusion to
   the punishment of blasphemy and idolatry under the Jewish Law. vid.
   [Ex. xix. 13. and] reference to Ex. xxi. 17, in Â§27, note 2. Thus, e.g.
   Nazianzen: While I go up the mount with good heart, that I may become
   within the cloud, and may hold converse with God, for so God bids; if
   there be any Aaron, let him go up with me and stand near. And if there
   be any Nadab or Abihu, or of the elders, let him go up, but stand far
   off, according to the measure of his purification....But if any one is
   an evil and savage beast, and quite incapable of science and theology;
   let him stand off still further, and depart from the mount: or he will
   be stoned and crushed; for the wicked shall be miserably destroyed. For
   as stones for the bestial are true words and strong. Whether he be
   leopard, let him die spots and all,' &c. &c. Orat. 28. 2.

   [953] The Arians argued that the word unoriginate implied originate or
   creature as its correlative, and therefore indirectly signified
   Creator; so that the Son being not unoriginate, was not the Creator.
   Athan. answers, that in the use of the word, whether there be a Son
   does not come into the question. As the idea of Father and Son does not
   include creation, so that of creator and creature does not include
   generation; and it would be as illogical to infer that there are no
   creatures because there is a Son as that there is no Son because there
   are creatures.

   [954] The whole of this passage is repeated in Orat. i. 32. &c. vid.
   for this particular argument, Basil also, contr. Eunom. i. 16.

   [955] i.e. of hosts.

   [956] John xiv. 9, 10.

   [957] Ib. x. 30.

   [958] Matt. vi. 9.

   [959] And so S. Basil, Our faith was not in Framer and Work, but in
   Father and Son were we sealed through the grace in baptism.' contr.
   Eunom. ii. 22. And a somewhat similar passage occurs Orat. ii. Â§41.

   [960] huiopoioumetha alethos. This strong term truly' or verily' seems
   taken from such passages as speak of the grace and truth' of the
   Gospel, John i. 12-17. Again S. Basil says, that we are sons, kurios,
   properly,' and protos primarily,' in opposition to tropikos,
   figuratively,' contr. Eunom. ii. 23. S. Cyril too says, that we are
   sons naturally' phusikos as well as kata charin, vid. Suicer Thesaur.
   v. hui& 231;s. i. 3. Of these words, alethos, phusikos, kurios, and
   protos, the first two are commonly reserved for our Lord; e.g. ton
   alethos hui& 232;n, Orat. ii. Â§37. hemeis huioi, ouk hos ekeinos phusei
   kai aletheia, iii. Â§19. Hilary seems to deny us the title of proper'
   sons; de Trin. xii. 15; but his proprium' is a translation of idion,
   not kurios. And when Justin says of Christ ho monos legomenos kurios
   hui& 232;s, Apol. ii. 6. kurios seems to be used in reference to the
   word kurios, Lord, which he has just been using, kuriologein being
   sometimes used by him as others in the sense of naming as Lord,' like
   theologein. vid. Tryph. 56. There is a passage in Justin's ad GrÃ¦c. 21.
   where he (or the writer) when speaking of ego eimi ho hon, uses the
   word in the same ambiguous sense; ouden gar onoma epi theou
   kuriologeisthai dunaton, 21; as if kurios, the Lord, by which I am' is
   translated, were a sort of symbol of that proper name of God which
   cannot be given. But to return; the true doctrine then is, that,
   whereas there is a primary and secondary sense in which the word Son is
   used, primary when it has its formal meaning of continuation of nature,
   and secondary when it is used nominally, or for an external resemblance
   to the first meaning, it is applied to the regenerate, not in the
   secondary sense, but in the primary. S. Basil and S. Gregory Nyssen
   consider Son to be a term of relationship according to nature' (vid.
   supr. Â§10, note 1.), also Basil in Psalm xxviii. 1. The actual presence
   of the Holy Spirit in the regenerate in substance (vid. Cyril, Dial. 7.
   p. 638.) constitutes this relationship of nature; and hence after the
   words quoted from S. Cyril in the beginning of the note, in which he
   says, that we are sons, phusikos, he proceeds, naturally, because we
   are in Him, and in Him alone.' vid. Athan.'s words which follow in the
   text at the end of Â§31. And hence Nyssen lays down, as a received
   truth, that to none does the term "proper," kuriotaton, apply, but to
   one in whom the name responds with truth to the nature,' contr. Eunom.
   iii. p. 123. And he also implies, p. 117, the intimate association of
   our sonship with Christ's, when he connects together regeneration with
   our Lord's eternal generation, neither being dia pathous, or, of the
   will of the flesh. If it be asked, what the distinctive words are which
   are incommunicably the Son's, since so much is man's, it is obvious to
   answer, idios hui& 232;s and monogenes, which are in Scripture, and the
   symbols of the essence,' and one in essence,' of the Council; and this
   is the value of the Council's phrases, that, while they guard the Son's
   divinity, they allow full scope, without risk of entrenching on it, to
   the Catholic doctrine of the fulness of the Christian privileges. vid.
   supr. Â§19, note.

   [961] Gal. iv. 6.

   [962] Cf. contr. Gent. init. Incarn. 57. ad Ep. Ã†g. 4. Vit. Ant. 16.
   And passim in Athan.

   [963] And so, Orat. ii. Â§32, kata tous mutheuomenous gigantas. And so
   Nazianzen, Orat. 43. 26. speaking of the disorderly Bishops during the
   Arian ascendancy. Also Socr. v. 10. Sometimes the Scripture giants are
   spoken of, sometimes the mythological.

   Introduction to the de Sententia Dionysii.

   ------------------------

   The following tract, like the last, is a letter to a person engaged in
   discussion with Arians, who were openly finding fault with the
   Definition of NicÃ¦a, and especially with the word Co-essential (Â§19).
   Montfaucon suggests that both epistles were addressed to the same
   person, the de Decretis (Â§25) having as it were challenged the Arians
   to cite passages from Dionysius on behalf of their own doctrine,
   whereupon their opponent came back to Athanasius with a request for
   further help. But the language of the first sentence of our present
   tract seems to imply that Athanasius had not previously heard of the
   discussions in question. However, slender as such grounds are, the
   tract furnishes no more decisive indication of date. (On certain
   expressions which might seem to carry the date back to the lifetime of
   Arius, see Prolegg. ch. ii. Â§7.)

   Dionysius the Great,' Bishop of Alexandria 233-265, was a pupil of
   Origen (Eus. H. E. vi. 29), and equally distinguished as a ruler of the
   Church and as a theologian. In all the controversies of his age (the
   lapsed, rebaptism, Easter, Paul of Samosata, Sabellianism, the
   authorship of the Apocalypse) his influence made itself felt, and his
   writings were very numerous (Westcott in D. C. B. i. p. 851 sq.; a good
   account of Dionysius in vol. I. of this series, p. 281 note). The most
   celebrated controversy in which he was involved was that which, a
   century later, gave rise to the tract before us.

   About the period when personal attacks on the Nicene leaders began to
   be exchanged for overt objections to the Nicene Definitions, the claim
   was freely made that the fathers' had been condemned by the latter: in
   other words, that they had held with the Arians (see below Â§1, aei men
   prophaseis...nun de kai diaballein tous pateras tetolmekasi).
   Accordingly we find Athanasius at about the same date, viz. early in
   the sole reign of Constantius, vindicating on the one hand the work of
   the Council, on the other the orthodox reputation of Dionysius. The
   Arians found material for their appeal to the latter in a letter
   addressed by him to certain bishops in Pentapolis, called Ammon and
   Euphranor. Whether or no Sabellius had been a native of that province,
   at any rate his doctrine was at that time so popular there that the Son
   of God was scarcely any longer preached in the Churches.' Exercising
   the right of supervision over those districts which had already become
   vested by prescription in the Alexandrian See, Dionysius wrote to
   Ammon, Bishop of Berenice, (Euseb. H. E. vii. 26, who enumerates three
   several letters to Ammon, Telesphorus, and Euphranor, and a fourth to
   Ammon and Euporus: he also refers to his letters to Dionysius of Rome:
   Montfaucon is therefore scarcely fair in charging Eusebius with
   suppressing the episode ne verbum quidem de hac historia fecerit!')
   insisting on the distinctness of the Son from the Father. In doing so
   he used strong expressions akin to the language of Origen on the
   subordination of the Son. These expressions were at once objected to by
   certain orthodox churchmen (Â§13, it is not clear whether they belonged
   to Pentapolis or Alexandria), who without consulting Dionysius went to
   Rome (about 260), and spoke against him in the presence of his
   namesake, the Roman Bishop. The latter, true to the traditions of his
   See since the time of Callistus (see Hipp. Philos IX. vii. ditheoi
   este), while steering clear of Sabellianism, was especially jealous of
   error in the opposite direction. Accordingly he assembled a synod (de
   Synod. 44), and drew up a letter to Alexandria, in which he rebuked
   firstly the Sabellians, but secondly and more fully those who separate
   the Godhead or speak of the Son as a work, including under this
   category certain unnamed catechists and teachers of Alexandria (De
   Decr. 26). At the same time he wrote personally to Dionysius, informing
   him that he was accused of maintaining the opinions in question. In
   answer to this letter, Dionysius of Alexandria drew up a treatise in
   four books, entitled Refutation and Defence,' and addressed to his
   namesake of Rome, in which he explained his language, and stated his
   belief in a manner which put an end to the controversy. He had been
   charged with maintaining that the Son was made, that He was not eternal
   (ouk aei en ho theos pater, ouk aei en ho huios,...ouk en prin
   gennethe, all' en pote hote ouk en k.t.l. Â§14), that he denied the
   co-essentiality (homoousion) of the Son, and separated Him from the
   Father (Â§16, 18, cf. Â§ 4, xenon kat' ousian k.t.l). In his Refutation
   and Defence, Dionysius admits the use of these expressions, withdraws
   the first (Â§15, line 1) and admits the propriety of the homoousion,
   although he himself prefers Scriptural language (Â§ 18. The section
   shews the unfixed use of the word. Dionysius had formerly used ousia in
   the sense of prote ousia, nearly as equivalent to hupostasis: but now
   he clearly takes it as deutera ousia, indicative not of Person but of
   Nature). That the Son was made, he explains as an inadequate formula,
   the word being applicable (in one of its many senses) to the relation
   of son to father (Â§20. The defence of Athanasius, that Dionysius
   referred to the Human Nature of Christ, is scarcely tenable. It is not
   supported by what Dionysius himself says, rather the contrary: and if
   his language did not refer to the Trinity, where would be its relevancy
   against Sabellianism?). The words en hote ouk en, and ouk en prin
   gennethe, he does not explain, but professes his belief in the eternal
   union of the Word with the Father (Â§Â§24, 25). Lastly, he repudiates the
   charge of dividing the Holy Trinity, or of mentioning Father and Son as
   though separate Beings: When I mention the Father, I have already
   mentioned the Son, before I pronounce His Name (Â§17, the closing words
   of the section are a complete formula of agreement with all that his
   Roman namesake could possibly require of him).

   That Dionysius in his Refutation and Defence' merely restated, and did
   not (kat' oikonomian) alter, his theological position is open to no
   doubt. Athanasius, not the Arians, had the right to claim him as his
   own. He is clearly speaking optima fide when he deprecates the pressing
   of statements in which he had given expression to one side only, and
   that the less essential side, of his convictions. At the same time we
   cannot but see that the Arians had good prima facie ground for their
   appeal. Here were their special formulÃ¦, those anathematised at NicÃ¦a,
   en pote hote ouk en and the rest, adopted, and the homoousion
   implicitly rejected, by the most renowned bishop Alexandria had yet
   had. (Newman, in de Decr. 26, note 7, fails to appreciate the reference
   to the language of Dion. Alex.) Moreover it is only fair to admit that
   not only in language, but in thought also, Athanasius had advanced upon
   his predecessors of the Alexandrian School. The rude shock of Arianism
   had shewn him and the other Nicene leaders the necessity of greater
   consistency than had characterised the theology of Origen and his
   school, a consistency to be gained only by breaking with one side of it
   altogether. While on the one hand Origen held fast to the Godhead of
   the Logos (kat' ousian esti theos), and to His co-eternity with the
   Father (aei gennatai ho soter hupo tou patros, and see de Decr. Â§27);
   he had yet, using ousia in its first' sense, spoken of Him as heteros
   kat' ousian tou patros (de Orat. 15), and placed him, after the manner
   of Philo, as an intermediary between God and the Universe. He had
   spoken of the unity of the Father and the Son as moral (Cels. viii. 12,
   te homonoi& 139; kai te sumphoni& 139;), insisted upon the huperoche of
   the Father (i.e. subordination' of the Son), and spoken (De Orat) as
   though the highest worship of all were to be reserved for the Father
   (Jerome ascribes still stronger language to him). Yet there is no real
   doubt that, as regards the core of the question, Athanasius and not his
   opponents is the true successor of Origen. The essential difference
   between Athanasius and the Conservatives' of the period following the
   great council consisted in the fact that the former saw clearly what
   the latter failed to realise, namely the insufficiency of the formulÃ¦
   of the third century to meet the problem of the fourth. We may then,
   without disparagement to Dionysius, admit that he was not absolutely
   consistent in his language; that he failed to distinguish the
   ambiguities which beset the words ousia, hupostasis, and even poiein
   and genesthai, and that he used language (ouk en prin gennethe and the
   like) which we, with our minds cleared by the Arian controversy, cannot
   reconcile with the more deliberate and guarded statements of the
   Refutation and Defence [965] .'

   The controversy of the two Dionysii has another interesting side, as
   bearing upon the means then employed for dealing with questions
   affecting the Church as a whole,--and in particular upon the position
   of the Roman Church as the natural referee in such questions. (Cf.
   Prolegg. ch. iv. Â§4.) This is not the place for a general discussion of
   the question, or for an attempt to trace its history previous to the
   case before us. But it should be noted, firstly, that when the
   Pentapolite (?) opponents of Dionysius desire a lever against him,
   their first resource is not a council of local bishops, but the Roman
   Church: secondly, that the Roman bishop takes up the case, and writes
   to his Alexandrian namesake for an explanation: thirdly, that the
   explanation asked for is promptly given. Unfortunately the fragment of
   the Roman letter preserved to us by Athanasius tells us nothing of the
   form of the intervention, whether it was the request of one co-trustee
   to another for an explanation of the latter's action in a matter
   concerning their common trust, or whether it was coupled with any
   assumption of jurisdiction at all like that involved in the letter of
   the Bishop of Alexandria to those of Libya. At any rate, the latter
   alternative has no positive evidence in our documents; and the
   fragments of the Refutation and Defence shew the most complete and
   resolute independence. There is nothing in the narrative of Athanasius
   which implies that the Alexandrine Bishop recognised or that the Roman
   Bishop claimed any dogmatic authority as belonging to the Imperial
   See.' The letter of Dionysius of Rome is certainly highly
   characteristic of the indifference to theological reasoning and the
   close adherence to the rule of faith as the authoritative solution of
   all questions of doctrine which marks the genius of Rome as contrasted
   with that of Alexandria (see Gore, The Church and the Ministry, ch. i.
   sub fin., and Harnack, Dg. i. 686, who observes upon the striking
   family likeness between this letter and that of Leo to Flavian, and of
   Agatho to the Sixth Ecumenical Council). Lastly, the Roman Church,
   which never troubled about a precedent adverse to her imperial
   instinct, never forgot one which favoured it. The intervention of
   Dionysius was treasured up in her memory, and, when the time came,
   fully exploited (supr. p. 113, note 3, where the note distinguishes
   somewhat too carefully between the Pope' of Rome and the Bishop,'
   papas, of Alexandria).

   The tract of Athanasius, with his extracts in de Decr. and de Syn.,
   tell us all that we know of the history of this important controversy.
   Dionysius had previously (Eus. H. E. vii. 6) had some correspondence
   with Xystus, the previous Bishop of Rome, on the subject of the
   Sabellian teaching current in the Pentapolis. He was in fact during his
   episcopate in constant communication with Rome and with the other
   important churches of the Christian World. His letters are much used in
   the sixth and seventh books of the History of Eusebius, to whom we are
   indebted for most of our knowledge of his writings.

   The general arrangement of the tract is as follows:--

   Â§1-4 are prefatory, the fourth section broadly indicates the line of
   the defence. Â§Â§5-12 deal with the incriminated passages: Athan. gives
   the history of them, and lays stress on their incomplete presentation
   of the belief of Dionysius, as having been written for a special
   purpose,--as may also be said of much of the language of the Apostles.
   But even in themselves the expressions of Dionysius are orthodox,
   referring (as Athanasius claims) to Christ as man. In Â§Â§13-23 he turns
   to the Refutation and Defence, from which he makes copious extracts,
   bringing out the diametrical opposition between Dionysius and the
   Arians. In Â§Â§24, 25 the anti-Arian doctrine of Dionysius is summed up,
   and Â§26 recapitulates the main points of Â§Â§5-12. He concludes (Â§27) by
   claiming a verdict upon the evidence, and urging upon the Arians the
   alternative of abandoning their error, or of being left with the devil
   as their only partisan.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [965] It may be added that the letter to Paul of Samosata quoted by
   Bull, Def. III. iv. 3, Petavius, Trin. I. iv. is not genuine.
   Posterity, which enveloped the name of Origen with storms of
   controversy, did not entirely spare his pupil: Basil (Ep. 41) taxes him
   with sowing the first seeds of the Anomoean heresy, Gennadius (Eccl.
   Dogm. iv.) calls him Fons Arii.'

   On the Opinion of Dionysius.

   ------------------------

   Letter of Athanasius concerning Dionysius, Bishop of Alexandria,
   shewing that he too was against the Arian heresy, like the Synod of
   NicÃ¦a, and that the Arians in vain libel him in claiming him as on
   their side.

   1. The Arian appeal to Dionysius a slander against him.

   You have been tardy in informing me of the present argument between
   yourself and the enemies of Christ; for even before your courtesy wrote
   to me, I had made diligent enquiry, and learnt about the matter, of
   which I heard with pleasure. I approved of the right opinion
   entertained by your piety concerning our blessed fathers, while on the
   present occasion I once more recognise the unreasonableness of the
   Arian madmen. For whereas their heresy has no ground in reason, nor
   express proof from holy writ, they were always resorting to shameless
   subterfuges and plausible fallacies. But they have now also ventured to
   slander the fathers: and this is not inconsistent, but fully of a piece
   with their perversity. For what marvel is it if men who have presumed
   to take counsel against the Lord and against His Christ,' are also
   vilifying the blessed Dionysius, Bishop of Alexandria, as a partisan
   and accomplice of their own? For if they are pleased to extol a man,
   for the support of their own heresy, even if they call him blessed,
   they cast upon him no slight affront, but a great one indeed; just like
   robbers or men of evil life who, when branded for their own practices,
   claim sober persons as being of their number, and thus defame their
   sober character.

   2. The Arian position inconsistent with Holy Scripture.

   If then they have confidence in their opinions and statements, let them
   broach their heresy nakedly, and shew from it if they think they have
   any religious argument whether from Scripture, or from human reason, in
   their defence. But if they have nothing of the kind, let them hold
   their peace. For they will find nothing from any quarter except the
   greater condemnation of themselves. Firstly from the Scriptures, in
   that John says, In the beginning was the Word;' whereas they say, he
   was not before he was begotten:' while David sings, in the character of
   the Father, my heart uttered a good Word' (Ps. xlv. 1, LXX), whom they
   allege to be in thought only, and originated from nothing. Further,
   whereas John once more says in the Gospel (i. 3), all things were made
   by Him, and without Him was not anything made,' while Paul writes,
   there is one Lord Jesus Christ by whom are all things' (1 Cor. viii.
   6), and elsewhere, all things were created in Him' (Col. i. 16), how
   will they have the boldness (or rather how will they escape disgrace)
   to oppose the sayings of the saints, by saying that the artificer of
   all things is a creature, and that He is a created thing in whom all
   things created have come into being and subsist? Nor, secondly, is any
   religious argument from human reason left them in their defence. For
   what man, Greek or barbarian, presumes to call one, whom he confesses
   to be God, a created thing, or to say that he was not before he was
   made? or what man, when he has heard Him whom he believes to be God
   alone say, This is My beloved Son' (Mat. iii. 17), and my heart uttered
   a good Word,' will venture even to say that the Word out of the heart
   of God has come to being out of nothing? or that the Son is a created
   thing and not the very offspring of Him that speaks? or again, who that
   hears Him whom he believes to be Lord and Saviour say, I am in the
   Father and the Father in Me,' and I and the Father are one' (John xiv
   10; x. 30), will presume to put asunder what He has made one and
   maintained indivisible?

   3. The Arians appeal to Dionysius as the Jews did to Abraham: but with
   equally little reason.

   Seeing this themselves, accordingly, and having no confidence in their
   own position, they utter falsehoods against religious men. But it would
   be better for them, when isolated, and perceiving that under
   examination they were at a loss and put to silence on all sides, rather
   to have turned back from the way of error and not to claim men whom
   they do not know, lest being confuted by them also they should carry
   off all the more disgrace. But perhaps they do not wish ever to depart
   from this wickedness of theirs; for they emulate this characteristic of
   Caiaphas and his party, just as they have learned from them to deny
   Christ. For they too, when the Lord had done so so many works, by which
   He shewed Himself to be the Christ the Son of the Living God, and being
   convicted by him, from thenceforth in all things thinking and speaking
   against the Scripture, and unable for a moment to face the proofs
   against themselves, betook themselves to the patriarch with the words,
   We have Abraham to our father' (Matt. iii. 9), thus thinking to cloke
   their own unreasonableness. But neither did they gain anything by these
   words, nor will these men, by speaking of Dionysius, be able to escape
   the guilt of the others. For the Lord convicted the latter of their
   wicked deeds by the words, This did not Abraham' (John viii. 40), while
   the same truth again shall convict these men of their impiety and
   falsehood. For the Bishop Dionysius did not hold with Arius, nor was he
   ignorant of the truth. On the contrary, both the Jews of that day, and
   the new Jews of the present day inherited their mad enmity against
   Christ from their father the devil. Well then, a strong proof that here
   once more these men are saying what is not true, but are maligning the
   man, is the fact that neither was he condemned and expelled from the
   church for impiety by other bishops, as these men have been from the
   clergy, nor did he of his own accord leave the church as the partisan
   of a heresy, but died honourably within it, and his memory is retained
   and registered along with the fathers to the present day. For if he had
   held with these men, or not vindicated what he had written, without
   doubt he too would have been treated as these men have been.

   4. The Arian appeal to Dionysius based upon an isolated fragment of his
   teaching to the neglect of the rest.

   And indeed this would suffice for the entire refutation of the new
   Jews, who both deny the Lord and slander the fathers and attempt to
   deceive all Christians. But since they think they have, in certain
   parts of the bishop's letter, pretexts for their slander of him, come
   let us look at these also, so that even from them the futility of the
   reasoning may be exposed, and they may at length cease from their
   blasphemy against the Lord, and at any rate with the soldiers (Mat.
   xxvii. 54), when they see creation witnessing, confess that truly He is
   the Son of God, and not one of created things. They say then that in a
   letter the blessed Dionysius has said, that the Son of God is a
   creature and made, and not His own by nature, but in essence alien from
   the Father, just as the husbandman is from the vine, or the
   ship-builder from the boat, for that being a creature He was not before
   He came to be.' Yes, he wrote it, and we too admit that his letter runs
   thus. But just as he wrote this, he also wrote very many other letters,
   and they ought to consult those also; in order that the faith of the
   man may be made clear from them all, and not from this alone. For the
   art of a ship-builder who has constructed many triremes is judged of
   not from one, but from all. If therefore he simply wrote this letter of
   which they speak as an exposition of his faith, or if this was his only
   letter, let them accuse him to their hearts' content,--for this
   suggestion really amounts to an accusation,--but if he was led to write
   as he did by the occasion and the person [966] concerned, while he also
   wrote other letters, defending himself where he had been suspected, in
   that case they ought not to have neglected the reasons, and hastily
   cast a slur upon the man, lest they should appear to be hunting merely
   stray expressions, while passing over the truth to be found in his
   other letters. For a husbandman also treats trees of the same sort now
   in one way now in another, according to the character of the soil he
   has to do with: nor would any one blame him because he cuts one, grafts
   another, plants another, and another again takes up. On the contrary,
   upon learning the reason, he all the more admires the versatility of
   his skill. Well then, unless they have consulted the writing
   superficially let them state the main subject of the letter; for so the
   malignity and unscrupulous character of their design will come out. But
   since they do not know, or are ashamed to state it, we must state it
   ourselves.

   5. The occasion of Dionysius' writing against the Sabellians.

   At that date certain of the Bishops in Pentapolis, Upper Libya, held
   with Sabellius. And they were so successful with their opinions that
   the Son of God was scarcely any longer preached in the churches.
   Dionysius having heard of this, as he had the charge [967] of those
   churches, sends men to counsel the guilty ones to cease from their
   error, but as they did not cease, but waxed more shameless in their
   impiety, he was compelled to meet their shameless conduct by writing
   the said letter, and to expound from the Gospels the human nature of
   the Saviour, in order that since those men waxed bolder in denying the
   Son, and in ascribing His human actions to the Father, he accordingly
   by demonstrating that it was the Son and not the Father that was made
   man for us, might persuade the ignorant persons that the Father is not
   a Son, and so by degrees lead them up to the true Godhead of the Son
   and the knowledge of the Father. This is the main subject of the
   letter, and this is the reason why he wrote it, by reason of those who
   so shamelessly had chosen to alter the true faith.

   6. Dionysius did not express his full opinion in the passages alleged.

   Well then, what is there in common between the heresy of Arius and the
   opinion of Dionysius: or why is Dionysius to be called like Arius, when
   they differ widely? For the one is a teacher of the Catholic Church,
   while the other has been the inventor of a new heresy. And while Arius
   to expound his own error wrote a Thaleia in an effeminate and
   ridiculous style like Sotades the Egyptian, Dionysius not only wrote
   other letters also, but composed a defence of himself upon the
   suspicious points, and came out clearly as of right opinions. If then
   his writings are inconsistent, let them not draw him to their side, for
   on this assumption he is not worthy of credit. But if, when he had
   written his letter to Ammonius, and fallen under suspicion, he made his
   defence so as to better [968] what he had previously said, but did so
   without changing, it must be evident that he wrote the suspected
   passages in a qualified sense [969] . But what is written or done in
   such a sense men have no business to construe maliciously, or wrest
   each one to a meaning of his own. For even a physician frequently in
   accordance with his knowledge applies to the wounds he has to deal
   with, remedies which to some seem unsuitable with a view to nothing but
   health. In like manner it is the practice of a wise teacher to arrange
   and deliver his lessons with reference to the characters of his pupils,
   until he has brought them over to the way of perfection.

   7. The language of the Apostles needs similar caution in particular
   passages.

   But if they accuse the blessed man (for the arguments of the Arians
   about him are in fact accusations against him) simply for writing thus,
   what will they do when they hear even the great and blessed Apostles in
   the Acts, firstly Peter saying (Acts ii. 22), Ye men of Israel hear
   these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God unto us by mighty
   works and wonders and signs which God did by Him in the midst of you,
   as ye yourselves know: Him, being delivered up by the determinate
   counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye by the hand of lawless men did
   crucify and slay;' and again (ib. iv. 10), In the name of Jesus Christ
   of Nazareth, Whom ye crucified, Whom God raised from the dead, even in
   Him doth this man stand here before you whole;' and Paul, relating (ib.
   xiii. 22) in Antioch of Pisidia how God, when He had removed Saul,
   raised up David to be king; to whom also He bare witness and said, I
   have found David the Son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who shall do
   My will. Of this man's seed hath God according to promise brought unto
   Israel a Saviour, Jesus;' and again at Athens (ib. xvii. 30), The times
   of ignorance therefore God overlooked; but now He commandeth men that
   they should all everywhere repent: inasmuch as He hath appointed a day
   in the which He will judge the world in righteousness by means of the
   man whom He hath ordained, whereof He hath given assurance unto all
   men, in that He hath raised Him from the dead;' or Stephen, the great
   martyr, when he says, Behold I see the heavens opened and the Son of
   man standing on the right hand of God.' Why, it is high time for them
   to brazen it out (for there is nothing too daring for them) and claim
   that the very apostles held with Arius: for they declare Christ to have
   been a man from Nazareth, and passible.

   8. The Apostles spoke of Christ as man, but also as God.

   Well then, such being the imaginations of these men, did the Apostles,
   since they used the above language, regard Christ as only a man and
   nothing more? God forbid. The very idea is out of the question. But
   here too they have acted as wise master-builders and stewards of the
   mysteries of God. And they have good reason for it. For inasmuch as the
   Jews of that day, in error themselves and misleading the Gentiles,
   thought that the Christ was coming as a mere man of the seed of David,
   after the likeness of the rest of the children of David's descent, and
   would neither believe that He was God nor that the Word was made flesh;
   for this reason it was with much wisdom that the blessed Apostles began
   by proclaiming to the Jews the human characteristics of the Saviour, in
   order that by fully persuading them from visible facts, and from
   miracles which were done, that the Christ was come, they might go on to
   lead them up to faith in His Godhead, by shewing that the works He had
   done were not those of a man but of God. Why, Peter, who calls Christ a
   man capable of suffering, at once went on (Acts iii. 15) to add, He is
   Prince of Life,' while in the Gospel he confesses, Thou art the Christ,
   the Son of the living God.' But in his Epistle he calls Him Bishop of
   souls and Lord both of himself and of angels and Powers. Paul, again,
   who calls Christ a man of the seed of David, wrote thus to the Hebrews
   (i. 3), Who being the brightness of His glory and the very image of His
   subsistence,' and to the Philippians (ii. 6), Who being in the form of
   God counted it not a prize to be on an equality with God.' But what can
   it mean to call him Prince of Life, Son of God, brightness, express
   image, on an equality with God, Lord, and Bishop of souls, if not that
   in the body He was Word of God, by whom all things were made and is as
   indivisible from the Father as is the brightness from the light?

   9. Dionysius must be interpreted like the Apostles.

   And Dionysius accordingly acted as he learned from the Apostles. For as
   the heresy of Sabellius was creeping on, he was compelled, as I said
   before, to write the aforesaid letter, and to hurl at them what is said
   of the Saviour in reference to His manhood and His humiliation, so as
   to bar them by reason of His human attributes from saying that the
   Father was a son, and so render easier for them the teaching concerning
   the Godhead of the Son, when in his other letters he calls Him from the
   Scriptures the word, wisdom, power, breath (Wisd. vii. 25), and
   brightness of the Father. For example, in the letters written in his
   defence, speaking as I have described, he waxes bold in the faith, and
   in piety towards Christ. As then the Apostles are not to be accused by
   reason of their human language about the Lord,--because the Lord has
   been made man,--but are all the more worthy of admiration for their
   wise reserve and seasonable teaching, so Dionysius is no Arian on
   account of his letter to Euphranor and Ammonius against Sabellius. For
   even if he did use humble phrases and examples, yet they too are from
   the Gospels, and his justification for them is the Saviour's coming in
   the flesh, on account of which not only these things, but others like
   them are written. For just as He is Word of God, so afterwards the Word
   was made flesh;' and while in the beginning was the Word; the Virgin at
   the consummation of the ages conceived, and the Lord has become man.
   And He who is indicated by both statements is one Person, for the Word
   was made flesh.' But the expressions used about His Godhead, and His
   becoming man, are to be interpreted with discrimination and suitably to
   the particular context. And he that writes of the human attributes of
   the Word knows also what concerns His Godhead: and he who expounds
   concerning His Godhead is not ignorant of what belongs to His coming in
   the flesh: but discerning each as a skilled and approved money-changer
   [970] ,' he will walk in the straight way of piety; when therefore he
   speaks of His weeping, he knows that the Lord, having become man, while
   he exhibits his human character in weeping, as God raises up Lazarus;
   and He knows that He used to hunger and thirst physically, while
   divinely He fed five thousand persons from five loaves; and knows that
   while a human body lay in the tomb, it was raised as God's body by the
   Word Himself.

   10. The expressions of Dionysius claimed by the Arians refer to Christ
   as Man.

   Dionysius, teaching exactly thus, in his letter to Euphranor and
   Ammonius wrote in view of Sabellius concerning the human predicates of
   the Saviour. For to the latter class belong the sayings, I am the Vine
   and My Father the Husbandman' (Joh. xv. 1), and faithful to Him that
   made Him' (Heb. iii. 2), and He created me' (Prov. viii. 22), and made
   so much better than the angels' (Heb. i. 4). But He was not ignorant of
   the passages, I am in the Father and the Father in Me' (Joh. xiv. 10),
   and He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father.' For we know that he
   mentioned them in his other Epistles. For while mentioning them there,
   he made mention also of the human attributes of the Lord. For just as
   being in the form of God He counted it not a prize to be on an equality
   with God, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave' (Phil. ii.
   6), and though He was rich, yet for our sakes He became poor,' so while
   there are high and rich descriptions of His Deity, there are also those
   which relate to His coming in the flesh, humble expressions and poor.
   But that these are used of the Saviour as man is apparent on the
   following grounds. The husbandman is different in essence from the
   vine, while the branches are of one essence and akin to it, and are in
   fact undivided from the vine, it and they having one and the same
   origin. But, as the Lord said, He is the vine, we are the branches. If
   then the Son is of one essence with ourselves, and has the same origin
   as we, let us grant that in this respect the Son is diverse in essence
   from the Father, like as the vine is from the husbandman. But if the
   Son is different from what we are, and He is the Word of the Father
   while we are made of earth, and are descendants of Adam, then the above
   expression ought not to be referred to the deity of the Word, but to
   His human coming. Since thus also has the Saviour said: I am the vine,
   ye are the branches, My Father is the husbandman.' For we are akin to
   the Lord according to the body, and for that reason he said (Heb. ii.
   12, Ps. xxii. 22), I will declare thy name unto my brethren.' And just
   as the branches are of one essence with the vine, and are from it, so
   we also having our bodies homogeneous with the Lord's body, receive of
   His fulness (Joh. i. 16), and have that body as our root [971] for our
   resurrection and our salvation. But the Father is called the
   husbandman, for He it was who by His Word cultivated the Vine, namely
   the manhood of the Saviour, and who by His own Word prepared for us a
   way to a kingdom; and none cometh to the Lord except the Father draw
   him to Him (Joh. vi. 44).

   11. The same is true of the analogous language of the Apostles.

   This then being the sense of the expression, it follows that it is of
   the vine, so understood, that it is written: Who was faithful to Him
   that had created Him' (Heb. iii. 2), and made so much better than the
   angels' (ib. i. 4), and He created me' (Prov. viii. 22). For when He
   had taken that which He had to offer on our behalf, namely His body of
   the Virgin Mary, then it is written of Him that He had been created,
   and formed, and made: for such phrases are applicable to men. Moreover
   not after (His taking) the body has He been made better than the
   angels, lest He should appear to have been previously less than or
   equal to them. But writing to Jews, and comparing the human ministry of
   the Lord to Moses, he said, having been made so much better than the
   angels,' for by means of angels the law was spoken, because the law was
   given by Moses, but grace came by Jesus Christ' (Joh. i. 17), and the
   gift of the Spirit. And whereas in those days the law was preached from
   Dan to Beersheba, now their sound is gone out into all lands' (Rom. x.
   18; Ps. xix. 3), and the Gentiles worship Christ, and through Him know
   the Father. The above things then are written of the Saviour as man,
   and not otherwise.

   12. The passages alleged from Dionysius are, when rightly understood,
   strictly orthodox.

   Well then, did Dionysius, as the adversaries of Christ reiterate, when
   writing of the human characteristics of the Son, and so calling Him a
   creature, mean that he was one man among others? Or when he said that
   the Word was not proper to the essence of the Father, did he hold that
   He was of one essence with us men? Certainly he did not write thus in
   his other epistles. but in them not only manifests a correct opinion,
   but as good as cries out by them against these people, saying as it
   were: I am not of the same opinion as you, you adversaries of God, nor
   did my writings furnish Arius with a pretext for impiety. But writing
   to Ammon and Euphranor on account of the Sabellianisers, I made mention
   of the vine and the husbandman and used other like expressions, in
   order that, by pointing out the human characteristics of the Lord, I
   might persuade those men not to say that it is the Father who was made
   man. For like as the husbandman is not the vine, so He that came in the
   body was not the Father but the Word; and the Word having come to be in
   the Vine was called the Vine, because of His bodily kinship with the
   branches, namely ourselves. In this sense, then, I wrote as I did to
   Euphranor and Ammonius, but your shamelessness I confront with the
   other letters written by me, so that men of sound mind may know the
   defence they contain, and my right mind in the faith of Christ. The
   Arians then ought, if their intelligence were sound, thus to have
   thought and held concerning the Bishop: for all things are manifest to
   them that understand, and right to them that find knowledge' (Prov.
   viii. 9). But since, not having understood the faith of the Catholic
   Church, they have fallen into impiety, and consequently, maimed in
   their intelligence, think that even straight things are crooked and
   call light darkness, while they think that darkness is light, it is
   necessary to quote also from the other letters of Dionysius, and state
   why they were written, to the greater condemnation of the heretic. For
   it was from them that we ourselves have learned to think and write as
   we are doing about the man.

   13. But other writings of Dionysius have to be considered also. Their
   history.

   The following is the occasion of his writing the other letters. The
   Bishop Dionysius having heard of the affairs in Pentapolis and having
   written, in zeal for religion, as I said above, his letter to Euphranor
   and Ammonius against the heresy of Sabellius, some of the brethren
   belonging to the Church, of right opinions, but without asking him, so
   as to learn from himself how he had written, went up to Rome; and they
   spoke against him in the presence of his namesake Dionysius the Bishop
   of Rome. And he, upon hearing it, wrote simultaneously against the
   partisans of Sabellius and against those who held the very opinions for
   uttering which Arius was cast out of the Church; calling it an equal
   and opposite impiety to hold with Sabellius, or with those who say that
   the Word of God is a thing made and formed and originated. And he wrote
   also to Dionysius to inform him of what they had said about him. And
   the latter straightway wrote back, and inscribed his books a Refutation
   and a Defence.' Here mark the detestable gang of the adversaries of
   Christ, and how they themselves have stirred up their disgrace against
   themselves. For Dionysius, Bishop of Rome, having written also against
   those who said that the Son of God was a creature and a created thing,
   it is manifest that not now for the first time but from of old the
   heresy of the Arian adversaries of Christ has been anathematised by
   all. And Dionysius, Bishop of Alexandria, making his defence concerning
   the letter he had written, appears in his turn as neither thinking as
   they allege, nor having held the Arian error at all.

   14. Object and general method of Dionysius in his Refutation and
   Defence.'

   And the mere fact of Dionysius having made his defence about the
   matters on which these people harp suffices completely to condemn the
   Arians, and to demonstrate their malignity. For he wrote, not in angry
   controversy, but to defend himself on the points where he was under
   suspicion. But in defending himself against charges, what does he do if
   not, while disposing of every charge of which he was suspected, by this
   very fact convict the Arian madmen of malignity? But, to complete their
   confusions by means of what he wrote in his defence, come, let me set
   before you his actual words. For from them you will learn firstly that
   the Arians are malicious, secondly that Dionysius has nothing to do
   with their error. To begin with, then, he wrote his letter as in
   Refutation and in Defence. But this means, surely, that he aims at
   refuting false statements, and defends himself for what he has written;
   shewing that he wrote not as Arius supposed, but that in mentioning
   what is said concerning the Lord in His human aspect, he was not
   ignorant that He was the Word and Wisdom undivided from the Father.
   Then he blames those who spoke against him for not quoting his language
   as a whole, but garbling it, and speaking not in good faith but
   disingenously and arbitrarily. And he compares them to those who used
   to impeach the letters of the blessed Apostle. But this complaint of
   his entirely clears him from sinister suspicion. For if he considers
   the detractors of Paul to be like his own, he shews precisely this,
   that he wrote as he did in Paul's sense. At any rate, in meeting
   severally the charges of his opponents, he explains all the passages
   cited by them: and, whereas in these latter he upsets Sabellius, in his
   subsequent letters he shews how sound and pious is his own faith.
   Accordingly whereas they would have it that Dionysius held that God was
   not always a Father, the Son did not always exist, but God existed
   apart from the Word, while the Son Himself was not before He was
   begotten: on the contrary, there was a time when He was not, for He is
   not eternal but has come later into being,'--see how he replies! Most
   of what he said, whether in the form of investigations, or collective
   inferences, or interrogatory refutations, or charges against his
   accusers, I omit because of the length of his discourses, inserting
   only what is strictly relevant to the charges against him. In answer to
   these, he writes after certain prefatory matter, in the first book
   inscribed Refutation and Defence' in the following terms.

   15. Extracts from the Refutation and Defence.'

   For never was there a time when God was not a father.' And this he
   acknowledges in what follows, that Christ is for ever, being Word and
   Wisdom and Power. For it is not to be supposed that God, having at
   first no such issue, afterwards begat a Son, but that the Son has His
   being not of Himself but of the Father.' And a little way on he adds on
   the same subject, But being the brightness of light eternal, certainly
   He is Himself eternal; for as the light exists always, it is evident
   that the brightness must exist always as well. For it is by the fact of
   its shining that the existence of light is perceived, and there cannot
   be light that does not give light. For let us come back to our
   examples. If there is sun, there is sunlight, there is day. If there is
   none of these things, it is quite impossible for there to be sun. If
   then the sun were eternal, the day also would be unceasing. But in
   fact, as that is not so, the day begins and ceases with the sun. But
   God is light eternal, never beginning nor ceasing. The brightness then
   lies before Him eternally, and is with Him without beginning and
   ever-begotten, shining in His Presence, being that Wisdom which said,
   "I was that wherein he rejoiced, and daily I was glad in his presence
   at all times" (Prov. viii. 30).' And again after a little he resumes
   the same subject with the words, The Father then being eternal, the Son
   is eternal, being Light of Light: for if there is a parent there is
   also a child. But if there were not a child, how and of whom can there
   be a parent? But there are both, and that eternally.' Then again he
   adds, God then being light, Christ is brightness; and being Spirit, for
   "God is a Spirit" (John iv. 24),--in like manner Christ is called the
   breath, for He is the "breath of the power of God" (Wisd. vii. 25).'
   And again, to quote the second book, he says, But only the Son, who
   always is with the Father and is filled of Him that IS, Himself also IS
   from the Father.'

   16. Contrast of the language of Dionysius with that of Arius.

   Now if the sense of the above statements were doubtful, there would be
   need of an interpreter. But since he wrote plainly and repeatedly on
   the same subject, let Arius gnash his teeth when he sees his own heresy
   subverted by Dionysius, and hears him say what he does not wish to
   hear: God was always Father, and the Son is not absolutely eternal, but
   His eternity flows from the eternity of the Father, and He coexists
   with Him as brightness with the light.' But let these, who have so much
   as imagined that Dionysius held with Arius, lay aside such a slander
   against him. For what have they in common, when Arius says, The Son was
   not before He was begotten, but there was once a time when He was not,'
   whereas Dionysius teaches, Now God is Light eternal, neither beginning,
   nor ever to end: accordingly the brightness lies before Him eternally,
   and coexists with Him, shining before Him without beginning and
   ever-begotten.' For in fact to meet the suspicion of others who allege
   that Dionysius in speaking of the Father does not name the Son, and
   again in speaking of the Son does not name the Father, but divides,
   removes, and separates the Son from the Father, he replies and puts
   them to shame in the second book, as follows.

   17. Dionysius did not separate the Persons of the Holy Trinity.

   Each of the names I have mentioned is inseparable and indivisible [972]
   from that next to it. I spoke of the Father, and before referring to
   the Son I designated Him too in the Father. I referred to the Son,--and
   even if I did not also expressly mention the Father, certainly He was
   to be understood beforehand in the Son. I added the Holy Spirit, but at
   the same time I further added both whence and through whom He
   proceeded. But they are ignorant that neither is the Father, qua
   Father, separated from the Son,--for the name carries that relationship
   with it,--nor is the Son expatriated from the Father. For the title
   Father denotes the common bond. But in their hands is the Spirit, who
   cannot be parted either from Him that sent or from Him that conveyed
   Him: How then can I, who use these names, imagine that they are
   sundered and utterly [973] separated from one another?' And after a
   little he goes on, Thus then we extend the Monad [974] indivisibly into
   the Triad, and conversely gather together the Triad without diminution
   into the Monad.'

   18. Dionysius did not hold that the Son was not of one essence with the
   Father.

   Next he confutes them upon their charge that he called the Son one of
   the things originated, and not of one essence with the Father (once
   more in the first book) as follows: Only in saying that certain things
   were perceived to be originated and created, I gave them as examples
   cursorily, as being less adequate, saying that neither was the plant
   [of one essence] with the husbandman, nor the boat with its builder.
   Then I dwelt more upon more apposite and suitable comparisons, and went
   at greater length into those nearer the truth, making out various
   proofs, which I wrote to you [975] in another letter, by means of which
   proofs I shewed also that the charge they allege against me is untrue,
   namely, that I denied Christ to be of one essence with God. For even if
   I argue that I have not found this word (homoousion) nor read it
   anywhere in the Holy Scriptures, yet my subsequent reasonings, which
   they have suppressed, do not discord with its meaning. For I gave the
   example of human birth evidently as being homogeneous, and saying that
   certainly the parents only differed from their children in not being
   themselves the children, else it would follow that there was no such
   thing as parents or children. And the letter, as I said before, I am
   prevented by circumstances from producing, else I would have sent you
   the exact words I then used, or rather a copy of all the letter: which
   I will do if I have an opportunity. But I know, and recollect, that I
   added several similitudes from kindred relations. For I said that a
   plant, sprung from a seed or root, was different from that whence it
   sprung, and at the same time entirely of one nature with it: and that a
   stream flowing from a well receives another form and name,--for the
   well is not called a river, nor the river a well,--and that both
   existed, and that the well was as it were a father, while the river was
   water from the well. But they pretend not to see these and the like
   written statements, but to be as it were blind, while they try to pelt
   me with two unconnected expressions like stones, from a distance, not
   knowing that in matters beyond our knowledge, and which require
   training to apprehend, frequently not only foreign, but even contrary
   examples serve to illustrate the problem in hand.' And in the third
   book he says, Life was begotten of Life, and flowed as a river from a
   well, and from Light unquenchable bright Light was kindled.'

   19. Inconsistency of the Arian appeal to Dionysius.

   Who that hears this will not set down as mad those who suspect
   Dionysius of holding with Arius? For lo! in these words, by arguments
   based on truth, he tramples upon his entire heresy. For by the simile
   of the Brightness he destroys the statements that He was not before He
   was begotten,' and There was a time when He was not,' as also by saying
   that His Father was never without issue. But their allegation that He
   was made of nothing' he destroys by saying that the Word was like a
   river from a well, and a shoot from a stock, and a child from a parent,
   and Light from Light, and Life from Life. And their barring off and
   separating the Word from God, he overthrows by saying that the Triad is
   without division and without diminution gathered together into the
   Monad. While their statement that the Son has no part in the Father's
   essence, he unequivocally tramples down by saying that the Son is of
   one essence with the Father. Wherein one must wonder at the impudence
   of the irreligious persons. How can they, when Dionysius whom they
   claim as their partisan says that the Son is of one essence [976] ,
   themselves go about buzzing like gnats with the complaint that the
   Synod was wrong in writing of one essence?' For if Dionysius is a
   friend of theirs, let them not deny what their partisan holds. But if
   they think that the expression was wrongly used, how can they reiterate
   that Dionysius, who used it, held with them? the more so as he does not
   appear to have written these things merely by the way, but having
   previously written other letters [977] , he convicts of falsehood those
   who had charged him with not saying that the Son was of one Essence
   with the Father, while he refutes those who thought that he said that
   the Word was originated, shewing that he did not hold what they
   supposed, but even if he had used the expressions, he had done so
   merely in order to shew that it was the Son, not the Father, who had
   put on the originated, formed, created body; for which reason the Son
   also is said to have been originated, created, and formed.

   20. Dionysius must be fairly interpreted, and allowed the benefit of
   his own explanatory statements.

   Clearly since he had previously used such expressions, while bidding a
   long farewell to the Arians, he demands a good conscience from his
   hearers,--being entitled to plead the difficulty, or perhaps one may
   say the incomprehensibleness of the problems concerned,--namely that
   they may judge not of the words but of the meaning of the writer, and
   the more so as there is very much to shew his intention. For instance
   he says himself: I used the examples of such relations cursorily, as
   being less adequate, the plant and the husbandman for instance; while I
   dwelt upon the more pertinent examples, and went at greater length into
   those nearer the truth.' But a man who says this shews that it is
   nearer the truth to say that the Son is eternal and of the Father, than
   to say that He is originated. For by the latter the bodily nature of
   the Lord is denoted, but by the former, the eternity of His Godhead. In
   the following words, for instance, he maintains, and not only so, but
   deliberately and with genuine demonstrative force, that they are
   refuted who charged him with not saying that the Son is of one essence
   with the Father: even if I did not find this expression in the
   Scriptures, yet collecting from the actual Scriptures their general
   sense, I knew that, being Son and Word, He could not be outside the
   Essence of the Father.' For that he does not hold the Son to be a thing
   created or formed,--for on this point also they have quoted him
   repeatedly--he says in the second book as follows: But if any one of my
   traducers, because I called God the Creator the maker of all things,
   thinks that I mean that He is Maker of Christ also, let him mark that I
   previously called Him Father, in which term the Son also is implied.
   For after I said that the Father is Maker, I added neither is He Father
   of the things He created, if He that begat is to be called Father in
   the strict sense. For the wider sense of the term Father we will work
   out in what follows. Neither is the Father a maker, if by maker is
   meant simply the artificer. For among the Greeks, philosophers are
   called "makers" of their own discourses. And the Apostle speaks of a
   "doer" (poietes) "of the law" (Rom. ii. 13), for men are called "doers"
   of inward qualities, such as virtue and vice; as God said, "I looked
   for one to do justice, but he did wickedness "' (Isa. v. 7, LXX).

   21. In what sense Dionysius said that the Son was made.'

   Of a truth one that hears this is reminded of the divine oracle which
   says, whithersoever the impious turns, he is destroyed' (Prov. xii. 7,
   LXX). For lo! turning subtly in each direction these impious men are
   destroyed, having even here no excuse as touching Dionysius. For he
   teaches openly that the Son is not a thing made or created, while he
   taxes and corrects those who accuse him of having said that God was the
   creator (of Christ), in that they failed to notice that he had
   previously spoken of God as Father, in which expression the Son also is
   implied. But in saying thus, he shews that the Son is not one of the
   creatures, and that God is not the maker but the Father of His own
   Word. And since certain had ignorantly objected to him that he called
   God the maker of Christ, he defends himself in various ways, shewing
   that not even here is what he said open to blame. For he had said that
   God was the maker of Christ in regard to His flesh, which the Word
   took, and which was in itself created. But if any one were to suspect
   that this referred to the Word, here too they were bound to give him a
   fair hearing. For as I do not hold that the Word is a creature, and
   call God not His maker but His Father, even if I in passing, while
   referring to the Son, call God a creator, yet even here I am able to
   defend myself. For the Greek philosophers call themselves makers
   (poietai) of their own discourses (logoi), although they are their
   fathers; while the Divine Scripture describes us as makers (doers) even
   of the motions of our hearts, speaking of "doers" of the law and of
   judgment and justice.' So that on all sides he demonstrates not only
   that the Son is not a thing made or created, but also that he himself
   has nothing to do with Arian error.

   22. The relation of the Son to the Father is essential, according to
   Dionysius.

   For let not any Arian suppose that he says even anything of the
   following kind: The Son coexists with the Father, so that while the
   names are correlated, the things are widely removed; and whereas the
   Son did not always coexist with the Father, since the Son came into
   being, God received from that fact the additional name of Father, and
   His coexistence with Him dates from that time as happens in the case of
   men. On the contrary, let him observe and bear in mind what we have
   said before, and he will see that the faith of Dionysius is correct.
   For in saying, For there was no time when God was not Father,' and
   again, God at any rate is light eternal without beginning nor ever to
   end, accordingly the brightness is eternally before Him and coexists
   with Him, without beginning and ever-begotten, shining in His
   presence,' he should make it impossible for any one to entertain any
   such suspicion against him. Moreover the examples of the well and the
   river, and the root and the branch, and the breath and the vapour, put
   to shame the adversaries of Christ when they reiterate the contrary
   against him.

   23. Dionysius did not hold that there are two Words.

   But since in addition to all his own iniquities Arius has raked up this
   expression also as if from a dunghill, adding that, The Word is not the
   Father's own, but the Word that is in God is different, while this one,
   the Lord, is outside of and has nothing to do with the Essence of the
   Father, and is only called "Word" conceptually [978] , and is not by
   nature and of a truth Son of God, but is called Son, He too, by
   adoption, as a creature;'--and since saying thus he boasts among the
   ignorant as though here too he has Dionysius as his partisan;--look at
   the faith of Dionysius on these points also, how he contradicts these
   perversities of Arius. For in the first book he writes as follows: Now
   I have said that God is the well of all that is good: while the Son has
   been described as the river which proceeds from Him. For word is an
   efflux of intelligence, and, to borrow language applicable to men, the
   intelligence that issues by the tongue is derived from the heart
   through the mouth, coming out different from the word in the heart. For
   the latter remains, after sending forth the other, as it was. But the
   other is sent forth and flies forth, and is borne in every direction.
   And so each is in the other, and each distinct from the other: and they
   are one and at the same time two. Likewise the Father and the Son were
   said to be one, and the One in the other.' And in the fourth book he
   says: For as our intelligence utters the word from itself, as the
   prophet says, My heart uttered a good word (Ps. xlv. 1), and, while
   either is distinct from the other, occupying a place of its own
   distinct from the other, the one dwelling and stirring in the heart,
   the other upon the tongue,--yet they are not separated, not for a
   moment lost to one another, nor is the intelligence without utterance
   (alogos), nor the word without intelligence, but the intelligence
   creates the Word being manifested in it, and the Word shews forth the
   intelligence having originated in it, and the intelligence is as it
   were an internal word, and the word an issuing intelligence; the
   intelligence passing over into the word, while the word circulates the
   intelligence among the hearers: and so the intelligence through the
   word gains a lodgment in the souls of the hearers, entering in along
   with the word; and the intelligence is as it were the father of the
   word, existing in itself, while the word is as it were the son of the
   intelligence, having its origin, not of course before the latter, nor
   yet concurrently with it from some external source, but by springing
   out of it;--so the mighty Father and universal Intelligence has the Son
   before all things as His Word, Interpreter and Messenger.'

   24. If the Arians agree with Dionysius let them use his language.

   These things Arius either never heard, or heard and in his ignorance
   did not understand. For otherwise, had he understood, he would not have
   so grossly libelled the Bishop, but certainly would revile him also, as
   he did ourselves, because of his hatred of the truth. For being an
   adversary of Christ, he will not hesitate to persecute also those who
   hold the doctrine of Christ, as the Lord Himself has said beforehand:
   If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you' (Joh. xv. 20). Or,
   if the leaders of impiety think Dionysius was a partisan of theirs, let
   them write and confess what he did. Let them write about the vine and
   the husbandman, the boat and the shipbuilder; and let them at the same
   time confess, as he did in his defence, the Unity of Essence, and that
   the Son is of the Father's Substance, and eternal; and the relation of
   intelligence and word, and the well and the river, and the rest; in
   order that they may see from the very contrast that he used the former
   class of language for a special purpose, but the latter as expressing
   the full meaning of the Christian Faith. And consequently let them, by
   adopting this language, revoke what they have held inconsistently with
   it. For in what way does the faith of Dionysius even approximate to the
   mischief of Arius? Does not Arius restrict the term Word to a
   conceptual sense, while Dionysius calls Him the true Word of God by
   nature? and while the one banishes the Word from the Father, the other
   teaches that He is the Father's own, and inseparable from His Essence,
   as the word is to the intelligence and the river to the well. If then
   any one is able to separate and banish the word from the intelligence,
   or to put asunder the river and the well, and wall them off, or to say
   that the river is of another essence than the well, and to shew that
   the water is from elsewhere, or ventures to divide the brightness from
   the light and to say that the brightness is from another essence, then
   let him join Arius in his madness. For such an one will cease to have
   the semblance even of human intelligence. But if Nature knows that
   these are indivisible, and that the offspring of those objects is their
   very own, then let no one any longer hold with Arius or slander
   Dionysius, but rather on these grounds admire the plainness of his
   language and the correctness of his faith.

   25. The teaching of Dionysius on the Word (continued).

   For with reference to the madness of Arius when he says that the Word
   which is in God is distinct from that one of which John said, In the
   beginning was the Word' (Joh. i. 1), and that God's own wisdom within
   Himself is not the same as that to which the Apostle refers as Christ
   the power of God and the wisdom of God' (1 Cor. i. 24), Dionysius
   resists and denounces any such error, as you may see in the second book
   where he writes on the subject as follows: "In the beginning was the
   Word;" but it was not Word that sent forth the Word, for "the Word was
   with God." The Lord has been made wisdom (cf. 1 Cor. i. 30): He then
   that sent out Wisdom was not Wisdom, for "I was she," saith Wisdom, "in
   whom He delighted." Christ is truth: but "Blessed," saith He, "be the
   God of truth"' (1 Esdr. iv. 40). There He overthrows both Sabellius and
   Arius, and shews both heresies to be equal in impiety. For neither is
   the Father of the Word Himself Word, nor is the offspring of the Father
   a creature, but the Own-begotten of His essence. And again the Word
   that proceeded forth is not Father, nor again is He one word out of
   many; but He alone is the Father's Son, the true and genuine Son by
   nature, Who both now is in Him, and is eternally and indivisibly from
   within Him. Thus the Lord is both Wisdom and Truth, and is not in the
   second place after another wisdom; but He alone it is through whom the
   Father made all things, and in Him He made the manifold essences of
   created things, and through Him He is made known to whom He will, and
   in Him He carries on and effects His universal providence. For Him
   alone does Dionysius recognise as Word of God. This is the faith of
   Dionysius: for I have collected and copied a few statements from his
   letters, enough to induce you to add to their number, but to put the
   Arians to utter shame on account of their libel upon the Bishop. For in
   all, even the details, of what he wrote, he exposed their error and
   branded their heresy.

   26. How Dionysius dealt with the Sabellians.

   Hence too it is manifest that even the letter to Euphranor and Ammonius
   was written by him in a different sense and for a special purpose. For
   this his defence makes plain. And in truth this is an effective form of
   argument for the subversion of the madness of Sabellius, for him that
   wishes for a short way with those heretics, not to start from
   expressions applicable to the deity of the Word, such as that the Son
   is God's Word and Wisdom and Power, and that I and the Father are one'
   (John x. 30), lest they, perverting what is well said should use such
   expressions as a pretext for their unblushing contentiousness, when
   they hear the texts, I and the Father are one,' and he that hath seen
   Me hath seen the Father.' (John x. 30; xiv. 9); but to emphasize what
   is said of the Saviour as Man, as He Himself has done, such as His
   hungering and thirsting, and being weary, and how He is the Vine, and
   how He prayed and has suffered. For in so far as these are lowly
   expressions, it becomes all the clearer that it was not the Father that
   was made man. For it follows, when the Lord is called the Vine, that
   there must also be a husbandman: and when He prayed, that there was one
   to hear, and when He asked, that there was one to give. Now such things
   shew far more readily the madness of the Sabellians, because He that
   prayed was one, He that heard another, one the Vine and another the
   Husbandman. For whatever expressions are cited to distinguish between
   the Son and the Father are used of Him by reason of the flesh which He
   bore for our sake. For created things are distinct in nature from God.
   Accordingly since, the flesh being a created thing, the Word,' as John
   says, was made flesh' (John i. 14), although He is by nature the
   Father's own and inseparable from Him, yet by reason of the flesh the
   Father is widely distinguished from Him. For He Himself permits that
   what is appropriate to the flesh should be said of him, that it may be
   made plain that the body was His own and not that of any other. But
   this being the sense of these sayings, Sabellius will be the more
   quickly confuted, it being proved that it was not the Father that was
   made flesh, but His Word, who also redeemed the flesh and offered it to
   the Father. But thus having confuted and persuaded him, he will next be
   able more readily to teach him concerning the deity of the Word, how
   that He is the Word and Wisdom, Son and Power, Brightness and Express
   Image. For it is here again a necessary inference that as the Word
   exists, there must also exist the Father of the Word, and as Wisdom
   exists, there exists also its Parent, and as Brightness exists so also
   does the Light; and that in this manner the Son and the Father are one.

   27. Conclusion.

   Dionysius knew this when he wrote. And by his first letters he silenced
   Sabellius, and in his others he overcame the heresy of Arius. For just
   as the human attributes of the Saviour overthrew Sabellius, so against
   the Arian madmen one must use proofs drawn not from the human
   attributes but from what betokens the deity of the Word, lest they
   pervert what is said of the Lord by reason of His Body, and think that
   the Word is of like nature with us men, and so abide still in their
   madness. But if they also are taught about His deity they will condemn
   their own error; and when they understand that the Word was made flesh,
   they too will the more easily distinguish in future the human
   characteristics from those which fit His deity. But this being so, and
   the Bishop Dionysius having been shewn by his writings to be pious,
   what will the Arian madmen do next? Convicted on this evidence, whom
   will they again venture to malign? For they needs must, since they have
   fallen from the foundation of the Apostles and have no settled mind of
   their own, seek some support, and if they can find none, then malign
   the fathers. But no one will believe them any more even if they make
   efforts to libel them, for the heresy is condemned on all hands. Unless
   perchance they will henceforth speak of the devil, for he is their only
   partisan, or rather he it is who suggested their heresy to them. Who
   then can any longer call men Christians' whose leader is the devil, and
   not rather Diabolici,' so that they may bear the name not merely of
   adversaries of Christ, but of partisans of the devil? Unless indeed
   they change round, and, rejecting the impiety they have contrived, come
   to know the truth. For this will at once be for their own good, and it
   is thus that it beseems us to pray for all those that are in error.

   [966] prosopou: but see also Newman's note 2 on de Decr. Â§14.

   [967] See Epiphanius, HÃ¦r. lxviii. 1. The arrangement is recognised as
   one of old standing in the sixth canon of NicÃ¦a, Let the old customs
   which exist in Egypt, Libya, and Pentapolis remain in force, namely
   that the Bishop of Alexandria should have authority over all these
   regions; since this is also customary for the Bishop of Rome. Likewise
   also at Antioch and in the other prefectures (it is decreed) that their
   prerogatives should be maintained to those churches.' The canon points
   to the natural explanation of the arrangement: the bishops of the
   capitals began from a very early date to exercise a loosely defined but
   gradually strengthening supervision over those of the rest of the
   province. In particular, they came to exercise a veto (and latterly
   more than a veto) upon the appointments to the provincial sees (ei tis
   choris gnomes, ib.). The bishops of Alexandria as well as Rome had even
   at this date acquired something of the rank of secular potentates
   (dunasteia, Socr. vii. 11, ede palai), but not to the extent to which
   it went later on (ib. 7. and supr. Apol. Ar. Â§9).

   [969] kat' oikonomian, as below Â§24. Cf. de Decr. Â§25, note 5. The word
   oikonomia has two main senses in Athanasius, both derived from the
   classical sense of management or dispensation, the adapting of means
   toward an end. (1) As in the present passage (cf. Origen in Migne XI.
   p. 77 b, oikonomikos): a use which is the lineal ancestor of the
   ill-sounding word economy' as a term in casuistry; (2) as applied to
   the Incarnation of our Lord, regarded as the Dispensation, the Divine
   Method for the salvation of mankind. This use is very frequent in St.
   Athanasius (compare Ep. Ã†g. 2. and Orat. ii. 11), and in earlier
   Fathers from Ignatius (Eph. 18 ekuophorethe hupo Marias kat'
   oikonomian, where Lightfoot refers to a more detailed history of the
   word in his unpublished note on Eph. i. 10) downwards (references in
   Soph. Lex. s.v.).

   [971] Cf. Orat. i. 48, note 7, and ii. 56, note 5.

   [972] This passage is somewhat differently rendered by Dr. Pusey in his
   letter on the Filioque (1876), p. 112.

   [973] The pantelos somewhat qualifies the repudiation. Dionysius
   expressly maintained three Hypostases in the Holy Trinity, in contrast
   to the language of Rome (de Decr. 26 note 7a) and the later use of
   Athanasius himself. But see the Tom. ad Antioch. of 362, below, and
   supra p. 90, note 2. Dionysius of Rome repudiates treis memerismenas
   hupostaseis, while Dionysius of Alexandria (in Bas. de Sp. S.)
   maintains that unless three Hypostases be recognised, the divine Triad
   is denied.

   [974] As pointed out by Newman on De Decr. 25, note 9, Trias and Monas
   are concrete, Trinitas and Unitas abstract terms; so that while
   Trinitas (and Monas) lend themselves to a Sabellian, Trias and Unitas

   Introduction to Vita S. Antoni.

   ------------------------

   (Written between 356 and 362)

   The Life of St. Antony is included in the present collection partly on
   account of the important influence it has exercised upon the
   development of the ascetic life in the Church, partly and more
   especially on the ground of its strong claim to rank as a work of
   Athanasius. If that claim were undisputed, no apology would be needed
   for its presence in this volume. If on the other hand its spurious and
   unhistorical character had been finally demonstrated, its insertion
   would be open to just objections. As it is, the question being still in
   dispute, although the balance of qualified opinion is on the side of
   the Athanasian authorship, it is well that the reader should have the
   work before him and judge for himself. To assist his judgment, it will
   be attempted in the following paragraphs to state the main reasons on
   either side. In doing so, I can honestly disclaim any bias for or
   against the Vita, or monasticism. Monasticism, with all its good and
   evil, is a great outgrowth of human life and instinct, a great fact in
   the history of the Christian religion; and whether its origin is to be
   put fifty years earlier or later (for that is the net value of the
   question at issue) is a somewhat small point relatively to the great
   problems which it offers to the theologian, the historian, and the
   moralist. But the point is at any rate worthy of careful and
   dispassionate examination. In attempting this, while holding no brief
   for either side, I may as well at once state my opinion on the
   evidence, namely that, genuine as are many of the difficulties which
   surround the question, the external evidence for the Vita is too strong
   to allow us to set it aside as spurious, and that in view of that
   evidence the attempts to give a positive account of the book as a
   spurious composition have failed.

   1. Bibliography. a. Sources. The only reference to Antony in other
   writings of Athanasius is in Hist. Ar. 14. See also Fest. Index x. Vita
   Pachomii in Act. SS. Mai., Tom. iii. Appx. (written late in the fourth
   century, but by a person who had known Pachomius). Coptic fragments and
   documents (for early history of Egyptian monasticism with occasional
   details about Antony) in Zoega, Catalogus codd. Copticorum, (Rome,
   1810), Mingarelli, Codd. copticorum reliquiÃ¦, (Bologna, 1785),
   Revillout, Rapport sur une mission, etc. (in Archives des Missions
   scientifiques et littÃ©raires, 3^me, sÃ©rie, 1879, vol. 4), AmÃ©lineau,
   Hist. de S. PakhÃ´me, &c. (Annales du MusÃ©e Guimet, vol. xvii. Paris,
   1889).

   b. Modern discussions. Since the Reformation the general tendency of
   protestant writers has been to discredit, of Roman Catholics to
   maintain the authority of the Vita. To the former class belong the
   Magdeburg Centuriators, Rivet, Basnage, Casimir Oudin; to the latter,
   Bellarmin, Noel Alexandre, and above all Montfaucon in the Benedictine
   edition of Athanasius (especially in the Vita Athanasii, Animadversio
   II. in Vitam et Scripta S.A., and the Monitum in Antonii Vitam, which
   latter may still claim the first rank in critical discussions of the
   problem). We may add, as more or less unbiassed defenders of the Vita,
   Cave (Hist. Lit. i. 193), and Tillemont (Mem. vol. vii.). All the above
   belong to the period before 1750. In more recent times the attack has
   been led by Weingarten (Ursprung des MÃ¶nchtums in nachkonst. zeitalter,
   reprinted in 1877 from Zeitschrift fÃ¼r K.G. 1876, and in Herzog, vol.
   x. pp. 758 sqq.), followed by Gass (in Ztsch. K.G. II. 274), and
   Gwatkin (Studies, &c. pp. 98-103). Israel, in Zeitsch. Wiss. Theol.
   1880, p. 130, &c., characterises Weingarten's attack on the Vita as too
   bold.' Keim (Aus dem Urchr. 207 sqq.) and Hilgenfeld (in Zeitsch. f.
   Wiss. Theol. 1878) put the book in the lifetime of Ath. without
   absolutely pronouncing for him as the author, while Hase (J. Prot. Th.
   1880), Harnack (especially in Th. Ltz. xi. 391, see also Das MÃ¶nchtum'
   u.s.w., Giessen, 1886), MÃ¶ller, Lehrb. der K.G. i. 372, and Eichhorn
   (Athanasii de vita ascetica testimonia,' Halle, 1886, the most
   convincing discussion of recent date, and indispensable) decide without
   hesitation in its favour. The discussion of Bornemann (In investigando
   monachatus origine, quibus de causis ratio habenda sit Origenis,
   Leipzig, 1885) may also be mentioned as bearing on the general subject;
   also the articles Monastery,' Coenobium,' and Hermits' in D. C. A. The
   article Antony' in D. C. B. passes over the question without
   discussion, excepting the trite, but untenable, statement that the Vita
   is probably interpolated.' Farrar (Lives of the Fathers, and Contemp.
   Review, Nov. 1887) follows Gwatkin. Picturesque representations of
   Antony (from the Vita) in Kingsley's Hermits and Newman's Historical
   Sketches, vol. 2.

   2. External evidence as to authorship and date. This is given by
   Montfaucon in the Monitum and reproduced by Eichhorn, pp. 36 sqq.

   i. The Version of Evagrius. Evagrius, presbyter (Eustathian) and
   subsequently (388) Bishop at Antioch (in Italy 364-373), translated the
   Vita Antonii into Latin. He prefaced with a short apology (see below,
   Vit. Ant. Â§1, note 1) for the freedom of his rendering, addressed
   Innocentio carissimo filio.' Now this Innocent, the friend of Jerome
   and Evagrius, died in the summer of 374, almost exactly a year after
   the death of Athanasius (D. C. B. iii. 31, 251). Of this identification
   there is no reason to doubt; still less ground is there for the
   hesitation (Hist. Lit. I. 283, non una est dubitandi ratio') of Cave
   and others as to the identity of the version, printed by Montfaucon and
   transmitted by very numerous mss. (quÃ¦ ingenti numero vidi,' Migne xxv.
   p. clviii.) with that actually made by Evagrius. Therefore, even if we
   make the two very improbable assumptions that the Dedication to
   Innocentius falls within a few weeks or days of his death (i.e. during
   the journey from Italy to Syria!), and that the Vita was translated by
   Evagrius almost immediately upon its composition, the composition of
   the Vita falls within a few months of the death of Athanasius. Its
   antiquity then is fully conceded' even by Mr. Gwatkin (Studies, p. 103,
   who yet, p. 98, puts it down to the generation after Athanasius!'). The
   translation of Evagrius also preserves what looks like the original
   heading. It should be added that the Evagrian version (read in the
   light of its preface), entirely excludes the hypothesis that the Greek
   text of the Vita is interpolated. Evagrius avowedly abridges at times,
   while in some cases he embellishes (see Â§82, note 16).

   ii. Jerome wrote his Vita Pauli in the Syrian desert, between 374 and
   379. He mentions both the Vita and its Latin Version in the prologue:
   if he had seen the latter he can scarcely have been ignorant of its
   heading. The non-mention of Athanasius as the author is an argumentum
   ex silentio of the most precarious kind. Some fifteen years later (de
   Script Eccles. 87, 88, 125) he repeatedly mentions Athanasius as the
   author, and specifies Evagrius as the translator.

   iii. Ephrem the Syrian (Opp. ed. 1732-43, I. p. 249) quotes Saint'
   Athanasius by name as the biographer of Antony. Ephrem died in 373. But
   little stress can be laid upon this testimony, in view of the lack of a
   critical sifting of the works which bear the name of this saint (so
   Tillemont viii. 229, and vii. 138). More important is

   iv. Gregory Naz. Or. 21, Athanasius compiled the biography of the
   divine Antony tou monadikou biou nomothesian en plasmati diegeseos'
   (cf. Vita, Prologue). This oration was delivered in 380, seven years
   after the death of Athanasius. Gregory, it is true, is not a good judge
   on a point of criticism. But he expresses the opinion of his time, and
   confirms and is confirmed by the evidence of Evagrius and Jerome.

   v. Rufinus, Hist. Eccl. I. viii. He would give an account of Antony,
   but ille libellus exclusit qui ab Athanasio scriptus etiam Latino
   Sermone editus est.' This was written 400 a.d.: if in a later work
   (Hist. Mon. 30, and see also 29) he happens to allude to the Vita
   without mentioning its author, we are not entitled to say that to
   Rufinus the work is anonymous' (Gwatkin, p. 103).

   vi. The Life of Pachomius, which (as above mentioned) has details of
   Antony's life independent of the Vita, also mentions the latter (c. 1)
   as the work of Athanasius. Though written perhaps as late as 390, this
   document is of great weight as evidence in the case (see KrÃ¼ger in
   Theol. Ltzg. 1890, p. 620).

   vii. Paulinus in his prologue to the Life of Ambrose (after 400) refers
   to the Vita as written by Athanasius.

   viii. Fifth-century historians, Palladius, Hist. Laus. 8, Socrates (H.
   E., i. 21) Sozomenus (i. 13) attest the established tradition of their
   day that Athanasius was the author of the Life.

   ix. Augustine (Conf. viii. 14, 15, 19, 29) and Chrysostom (Hom. 8 on S.
   Matthew) mention the Vita without giving the name of the author. But we
   are not entitled to cite them as witnesses to its (alleged) anonymity,
   which they neither affirm nor imply.

   The above witnesses, all of whom excepting No. viii. come within 50
   years of the death of Athanasius, are a formidable array. No other work
   of Athanasius can boast of such external evidence in its favour. And in
   the face of such evidence it is impossible to place the composition
   later than the lifetime of the great Bishop. We have therefore to ask
   whether the contents of the Vita are in irreconcileable conflict with
   the result of the external evidence: whether they point, not indeed to
   a later age, for the external evidence excludes this, but to an author
   who during the lifetime of Athanasius (i.e. not later than the year of
   his death) ventured to publish a hagiographic romance in his name
   (Evagrian' heading, and Â§Â§71, 82).

   3. Internal Evidence. It may be remarked in limine that for the
   existence of Antony there is not only the evidence of the Vita itself,
   but also that of many other fourth-century documents (see above 1.a.
   under sources'). Weingarten quite admits this (R. E., X. 774, but he
   implies the contrary in his Zeit-tafeln, ed. 3, p. 228); and Mr.
   Gwatkin is certainly far ahead of his evidence when he pronounces
   (Arian Controversy, p. 48) that Antony never existed.'

   a. Origin and early history of Monasticism. According to the Vita, the
   desert was unknown to monachoi (solitary ascetics) at the time (about
   275? Vit. Â§3) when Antony first adopted the ascetic life. About the
   year 285 he began his twenty years' sojourn in the ruined fort. To the
   end of this sojourn belongs the first great wave of Monastic settlement
   in the desert. During the later part of the great persecution
   monasteries' and monks begin to abound (Â§44, 46). The remainder of his
   long life (311-356) is passed mainly in his inner mountain,' where he
   forms the head and centre of Egyptian monasticism. Now it is contended
   by Weingarten and his followers that the Vita is contradicted in this
   important particular by all the real evidence as to the origin of
   monasticism, which cannot be proved to have originated before the death
   of Constantine. But Eichhorn has I think conclusively shewn the
   hastiness of this assumption. Passing over the disputable evidence of
   the De Vita Contemplativa ascribed to Philo, (which Weingarten
   endeavours, against Lucius and others, to put back to a date much
   earlier than the third century and out of relation to Christian
   asceticism [979] ), the writings of Athanasius himself are the
   sufficient refutation of the late date assigned to the rise of
   monachism.

   In the writings of the supposed date (356-362) of the Vita, references
   to monks are very frequent (e.g. Apol. Fug. 4, Apol. Const. 29): but
   previous to this (339) we find them mentioned in Encyl. Â§3, and yet
   earlier, Apol. Ar. 67 (see below). In the letter to Dracontius (Letter
   49 in this vol.), corporate monasticism is implied to be no novel
   institution. Dracontius himself (about 354) is president of a
   monastery, and many other similar communities are referred to. (Gwatkin
   deals with this letter in an unsatisfactory fashion, p. 102, see the
   letter itself, Â§Â§7, 9, and notes.) The letter to Amun, probably earlier
   than that just mentioned, is clearly (sub. fin.) addressed to the head
   of a monastic society. Again, the bishops Muis and Paulus of Letter 49,
   Â§7, who were monks before their consecration, had been in the monastery
   of TabennÃ¦ before the death of Pachomius, which occurred almost
   certainly in 346 (Eichhorn 12, 13. The whole history of Pachomius, who
   was only a year or two older than Athanasius, although personally but
   little known to him, his monastery being at TabennÃ¦, an island near
   PhilÃ¦, is in conflict with Weingarten's theory). Lastly [980] one of
   the most characteristic and life-like of the documents relating to the
   case of Arsenius and the Council of Tyre, namely the letter of Pinnes
   to John Arcaph (Apol. Ar. 67) carries back the evidence earlier still.
   Pinnes is presbyter of a monastery' (mone): that mone here means a
   society of monks, and not a posting station (Weing. in R. E., X. p.
   775) is clear from the mention of Helias the monk,' and I, Paphnutius,
   monk of the same monastery.' This letter proves that there were not
   only Catholic but Meletian monks, and these not hermits but in
   societies: and thus the origin of the solitary type of monasticism goes
   back as far as the Meletian schism. (The existence of Meletian monks is
   attested independently of this letter, see Eich. p. 347.) Weingarten is
   quite unable to deal with this obstacle to his theory. His argument is
   simply this: either the letter has nothing to do with monks and
   monasteries (he overlooks Paphnutius), or it must be rejected as
   spurious! What reductio ad absurdum could be more complete? In an
   equally desperate way he deals with the clear evidence of Aphraates,
   Hom. vi., as to the existence of (at any rate) solitary monasticism in
   Eastern Syria as early as 336. See Texte und Untersuchungen iii. 3, pp.
   xvi. 89, &c. (Leipzig, 1888.)

   b. Historical misstatements. i. It is better to include under this head
   rather than under the last the title ad peregrinos fratres. Who were
   the foreign monks' (tous en te xene monachous)? The introduction of
   monasticism into the West seems to belong to the time of S. Ambrose
   (Aug. Conf. viii. 6, cf. Sozom. III. 14, the European nations [before
   361] had no experience of monastic societies') or rather Martin of
   Tours (D.C.B. iii. p. 840). The statement (Encycl. Brit. Monachism')
   that Athanasius carried the Vita Atonii to Rome in 340 is based on a
   misunderstanding of Jerome (Ep. 127), who really says no more than that
   the existence of monachism in Egypt first became known at Rome from the
   visits of Athanasius and of his successor Peter. If then the peregrini
   fratres' are to be looked for in the West, we have a serious
   difficulty, and must choose between the Vita and Sozomen. But the
   foreign monks may have belonged to the East. (I cannot see that Â§93
   assumes,' as Mr. Gwatkin maintains, the existence of numerous monks in
   the West.' What is said is simply that Antony had been heard
   of--ekousthe--in Spain, Gaul, and Africa.) However, the point must be
   left uncertain, and so far allowed to weigh against the Vita.

   ii. Early intercourse of Athanasius with Antony (Prologue, and note 2).
   If the Benedictine text is correct, the reference must be to the period
   before Athanasius became deacon to Bishop Alexander, in fact to a
   period previous to 318 a.d. Tillemont (viii. 652), who maintains the
   other reading, mainly relies upon the impossibility of finding room for
   the intercourse in question in the early life of Athanasius. But his
   only source of knowledge of that period is Rufinus, a very poor
   authority, and Montfaucon replies with some force (Animadv. 11) that we
   have no sufficient information as to how Athanasius passed the years
   previous to his ordination by Alexander. He also suggests that
   Athanasius may have been one of those who followed Antony's example
   (Â§46, cf. Apol. c. Ar. 6) after his first visit to Alexandria. I may
   add that the notes to the Vita will call attention to several points of
   contact between the teaching of Antony and the earliest treatises of
   Athanasius. Yet the impression left on the mind is here again one of
   uncertainty (cf. Prolegg. ch. ii. Â§1 fin.).

   iii. The narrative about Duke Balacius (Â§86: see note there) is another
   genuine difficulty, only to be got over if we suppose either that
   Athanasius in one place tells the story inaccurately, and corrects
   himself in the other, or that the Hist. Arian. was partly written for
   Athanasius by a secretary.

   iv. Supposed learning of Antony. His ignorance of letters and of the
   Greek language does not prevent his forcibly employing the most
   effective arguments against Arianism (69), vindicating the Incarnation
   (74) much in the manner of Athanasius, and above all showing a fair
   acquaintance (72-74) with Platonic philosophy (see notes there). But
   everything in the biography points to a man of robust mind, retentive
   memory (3) and frequent intercourse with visitors. If he were so, he
   can scarcely have been ignorant of the theological controversies of his
   day, or of the current philosophical ideas. Nor can I see that the
   philosophy of his argument against the Greeks goes beyond what that
   would imply. His allusion to Plato does not look like a first-hand
   citation. And even an Athanasius would not so entirely rise out of the
   biographical habits of his day as to mingle nothing of his own with the
   speeches of his hero (Equidem quid Antonio quid Athanasio tribuendum
   sit uix diiudicari posse concedo,' Eich. p. 52).

   c. Inconsistencies with Athanasius. It is the most serious objection to
   the Athanasian authorship of the Vita that Athanasius (with the
   exception of the antilegomenon' Hist. Ar. 14) nowhere else mentions
   Antony by name. Especially in the letter to Dracontius, who at first
   refused the Episcopate in the supposed interests of his soul, we might,
   it is argued, have expected a reference to the deep reverence of Antony
   (Â§67) for even the lowest clergy (the persons enumerated, Letter 49,
   Â§7, are bishops who had previously been monks, and have nothing to do
   with this question). That is true. We might have expected it. But as a
   matter of fact Athanasius uses another argument instead (see Letter 49,
   Â§3, note 8^a). It does not follow that he did not know of the Antony of
   the Vita. But although the letter in question has been pressed unduly,
   the general objection, as an argumentum ex silentio on a rather large
   scale, remains [981] . Some more detailed points must now be
   considered.

   a. Demons and Miracles. The writings of Athanasius are singularly free
   from the tendency to indulge in the marvellous. The death of Arius he
   regards as a judgment, and relates it with a certain awe-struck
   sobriety. The pheme of Julian's death in the Narrat. ad Ammon. comes
   less under the head of ecclesiastical miracle than under that of ta
   theia ton pregmaton (Herod. ix. 100, cf. Grote v. 260 sq.); whereas the
   Vita swarms with miraculous and demoniacal stories, some (passed over
   in silence by Newman and other apologists for the Life) indescribably
   silly (e.g. Â§Â§53, 63). Hence even Cave allows that the Vita contains
   things tanto viro indigna.' But it must be observed (1) that Antony
   disclaims, and his biographer disclaims for him, inherent miraculous
   power. His miracles are wrought by Christ in answer to prayer, and he
   prefers that those who desire his help should obtain what they want by
   praying for themselves (cf. also Â§49). (2) That again and again (esp.
   Â§Â§16-43) he insists on the absolute subjection of all evil powers to
   God, and their powerlessness to injure believers in Christ. (3) That
   Athanasius recognises semeia (in the sense of miracles, see Letter 49,
   Â§9, note 9) as a known phenomenon in the case both of bishops and of
   monks. (4) That his language about demons and the power of the sign of
   the Cross in dispersing them is quite of a piece with what is related
   in the Vita (see notes passim). (5) On the clairvoyance of Antony, and
   one or two kindred matters which offer points of contact with phenomena
   that have been recently the subject of careful research, notes will be
   found below giving modern references. On the whole, one could wish that
   Athanasius, who is in so many ways surprisingly in touch with the
   modern mind (supra, introd. to de Incar and Prolegg. ch. iv. Â§2 d and
   Â§3), had not written a biography revealing such large credulity. But we
   must measure this credulity of his not by the evidential methods of our
   own day, but by those of his own. If we compare the Vita, not with our
   modern biographies but with those, say, of Paul and Hilarion by Jerome,
   its superiority is striking (this is pointed out by W. IsraÃ«l in
   Zeitschr fÃ¼r Wiss. Theol. 1878, pp. 130, 137, 145, 153). For myself I
   should certainly prefer to believe that Athanasius had not written many
   things in the Vita: but I would far rather he had written them all than
   the one passage Hist. Ar. Â§38 fin.

   b. Theology. That there should be certain characteristic differences
   from the theology of Athanasius is what one would expect in an account
   of Antony that bore any relation to the historical person. Such is the
   anthropomorphic tendency, shewn especially in the corporeal nature
   ascribed to demons. Such perhaps is a tinge of naive semi-pelagianism
   about the Hermit's language (Â§20 and elsewhere); we cannot forget the
   connection of Cassian's Collations with Egyptian monasticism. Once
   again, Antony's shame of the body is not in the spirit of the writer ad
   Amunem' (Gwatkin, Studies, p. 102). Lastly, in Antony's account of the
   heathen gods (Â§76) we miss the characteristic Euhemerism of Athanasius
   (see supra, pp. 10, 62, &c.). Throughout, in fact, the ruder monastic
   instinct crops up from under the Athanasian style and thought of the
   biographer. But the latter is also unmistakable (see the notes passim),
   and the differences have been certainly made too much of. I will give
   one example from Mr. Gwatkin, who says (ubi supra), Athanasius does not
   speak of pronoia like the Vita (c. 49, 66, 74), for de Fuga 25
   specially refers to his providential escape from Syrianus, and c. Gent.
   47, pronoia ton panton is very incidental.' Now certainly the constant
   introduction of pronoia, which Mr. Gwatkin has understated, is a marked
   feature of the Vita. But I am not prepared to say that Athanasius could
   not speak in this way. The word is common, and even characteristic, in
   his writings. A few examples will support this statement; more will be
   referred to in the index to this volume.

   De Incarn. 2.1. ten ton holon pronoian kath' heauton ouk einai
   mothologousin.

   14. 6. tou dia tes idias pronoias...didaskontos peri tou patros.

   Epist. Ã†g. 15. blepontes...panta taxei kai pronoi& 139; kinoumena.

   Apol. Fug. 17. emele gar autois...mete ten horismenen para tes Pronoias
   krisin prolambanein (and so in Â§Â§9, 16, 22, 25 of this short tract).

   Orat. iii. 37. O Pater en to Uio ton panton ten pronoian poieitai.

   If each one of these and numberless other references to Providence is
   very incidental,' those in the Vita may surely claim the benefit
   (whatever that may be) of the same formula.

   The above are the principal materials for a decision as to the
   genuineness of the Vita: and I do not see how they can justify any
   opinion but that stated at the outset. Against the Vita we have certain
   historical difficulties (intercourse with Athanasius, peregrini
   fratres, Balacius), and arguments ex silentio, a kind of evidence
   seldom conclusive. For it, we have a quite unusual array of external
   evidence, including an almost contemporary version, the absence of any
   room for its date at a safe distance from its traditional author, and
   the many points of contact, as well as the characteristic differences
   between the Vita and the writings of Athanasius. Moreover on the
   kindred question of the origin of monasticism, Weingarten's theory
   breaks down, and leads him to suicidal steps in more than one
   direction. Although, therefore, it is permissible to keep an open mind
   on the subject, we must recognise that the enterprise of the recent
   assailants of the Vita is at present at a dead halt, that overwhelming
   probability is against them.

   But if Athanasius wrote the Vita, it does not follow that all its less
   edifying details are true, nor that its portraiture is free from
   subjectivity [982] . At the same time, to the present writer at least,
   the lineaments of a genuine man, homoiopathous hemin, stand out from
   the story. Doubtless there is idealisation, panegyric, an absence of
   sinfulness (Gwatkin, Studies, p. 100). But the moderate value set on
   miracles (38, 56), the absence of the element of fear from his religion
   (42, &c.), his serene courtesy (73) and uniform cheerfulness (67, 70),
   the caution against being tempted to excess in ascetic exercises (25),
   the ready half-humorous good sense (73, 85) of the man, are human
   touches which belong to flesh and blood, not to hagiographic
   imagination. But here the question is one of individual taste. At any
   rate the Vita embodies the best spirit of early monasticism. It was the
   pure desire to serve God and fulfil the spirit of the Gospel that led
   Antony to part with all that might make the world precious to him, and
   to betake himself to his long voluntary martyrdom of solitude,
   privation, and prayer. We see nothing but tenderness and love of men in
   his character, nothing of the fierce bloodthirsty fanaticism which in
   persons like Senuti made fifth-century monasticism a reproach to the
   Christian name. Had Antony lived in our time, he might have felt that
   the solitary life was a renunciation of the highest vocation of which
   man is capable, the ministry to the material and spiritual needs of
   others. But it is not given to man to see all aspects of truth at once
   and to our bustling, comfort-loving age, even the life of Antony has
   its lesson.

   The Vita has undoubtedly exercised a powerful and wide-spread
   influence. Upon it Jerome modelled his highly idealised tales of Paul
   and Hilarion; at Rome and all over the West it kindled the flame of
   monastic aspirations; it awoke in Augustine (Conf. viii. ubi supra) the
   resolution to renounce the world and give himself wholly to God. The
   ingens numerus of Latin manuscripts, and the imitation of its details
   in countless monastic biographies, testify to its popularity in the
   middle ages. Like monasticism itself, its good influence was not
   without alloy; but on the whole we may claim for it that it tended to
   stimulate the nobler of the impulses which underlie the monastic life.

   A few words may be added on the evidence of the Vita as to the form and
   motive of early monachism. In the Life of Antony, the stages are (1)
   ascetics living in the towns and villages, not withdrawn from society
   (Â§Â§3, 4); (2) solitary monasticism in the desert, away from human
   society; and, as the fame of Antony increases, (3) the formation (Â§44)
   of clusters of cells centering round some natural leader, the germ of
   the laura (such as the community of TabennÃ¦ under Pachomius). Of
   organised monastic communities the Vita tells us nothing. With regard
   to the motive of the earliest monasticism, this has been variously
   sought in (1) the development of the ascetic element present in
   Christianity from the very first; (2) in the influence of the
   Alexandrian School, especially Origen, who again is influenced by the
   spirit of revolt against the body and detachment from the world which
   characterised neo-Platonism (see Bornemann's work mentioned above); (3)
   in the persecutions, which drove Christians to the desert (Eus. H. E.
   vi. 42), which some adopted as their home; (4) to the (not necessarily
   conscious) imitation of analogous heathen institutions, especially the
   societies of hagneuontes which were gathered round or in the temples of
   Serapis (Weingarten, R. E., X. 779-785. Revillout, p. 480 n, refers to
   Zoega, p. 542, for the fact that Pachomius himself was a monk of
   Serapis before his forced baptism by his Christian neighbours; and that
   after it he continued his ascetic life with no external difference. (5)
   To the desire to avoid civil obligations, already marked in the
   Rescript of Valens (Cod. Th. xii. 1. 63, quidam ignauiÃ¦ sectatores
   desertis civitatum muneribus, &c.). Of the above motives the Vita gives
   no support to any but the first, which it directly confirms, and
   perhaps indirectly to the second. The date of the Vita depends mainly
   on the view to be taken of Â§82, where see note 16.

   monasticism.

   [981] It is fortified by the silence of Eusebius' (1) as to monks in
   general (but yet see H. E. II. 17, vol. i., p. 116, note in this

   Ã†gypt. But inasmuch as Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria, hath lately
   set forth in a several volume, intituled of his life, his manners and
   converasiton, how openly he buckled with divils, how he over-reached
   their slights and subtle combats, and wrought many marvellous and
   strange miracles, I think it superfluous on my part to intreat
   thereof.']

   Life of Antony.

   ------------------------

   The life and conversation of our holy Father, Antony: written and sent
   to the monks in foreign parts by our Father among the Saints,
   Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria.

   Athanasius [983] the bishop to the brethren in foreign parts.

   You have entered upon a noble rivalry with the monks of Egypt by your
   determination either to equal or surpass them in your training in the
   way of virtue. For by this time there are monasteries among you, and
   the name of monk receives public recognition. With reason, therefore,
   all men will approve this determination, and in answer to your prayers
   God will give its fulfilment. Now since you asked me to give you an
   account of the blessed Antony's way of life, and are wishful to learn
   how he began the discipline, who and what manner of man he was previous
   to this, how he closed his life, and whether the things told of him are
   true, that you also may bring yourselves to imitate him, I very readily
   accepted your behest, for to me also the bare recollection of Antony is
   a great accession of help. And I know that you, when you have heard,
   apart from your admiration of the man, will be wishful to emulate his
   determination; seeing that for monks the life of Antony is a sufficient
   pattern of discipline. Wherefore do not refuse credence to what you
   have heard from those who brought tidings of him; but think rather that
   they have told you only a few things, for at all events they scarcely
   can have given circumstances of so great import in any detail. And
   because I at your request have called to mind a few circumstances about
   him, and shall send as much as I can tell in a letter, do not neglect
   to question those who sail from here: for possibly when all have told
   their tale, the account will hardly be in proportion to his merits. On
   account of this I was desirous, when I received your letter, to send
   for certain of the monks, those especially who were wont to be more
   frequently with him, that if I could learn any fresh details I might
   send them to you. But since the season for sailing was coming to an end
   and the letter-carrier urgent, I hastened to write to your piety what I
   myself know, having seen him many times, and what I was able to learn
   from him, for I was his attendant for a long time, and poured water on
   his hands [984] ; in all points being mindful of the truth, that no one
   should disbelieve through hearing too much, nor on the other hand by
   hearing too little should despise the man.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [983] This heading, preserved in the Evagrian version, is probably the
   original one. Compare the statement to the same effect in Vit. Pachom.
   63. The preface to the Evagrian version is important as bearing on the
   question of interpolation. It runs as follows: Evagrius, presbyter, to
   his dearest son Innocent, greeting in the Lord. A word-for-word
   translation from one language to another obscures the sense and as it
   were chokes the corn with luxuriant grass. For in slavishly following
   cases and constructions, the language scarcely explains by lengthy
   periphrasis what it might state by concise expression. To avoid this, I
   have at your request rendered the Life of the blessed Antony in such a
   way as to give the full sense, but cut short somewhat of the words. Let
   others try to catch syllables and letters; do you seek the meaning.'

   [984] Cf. 2 Kings iii. 11: the expression merely refers to personal
   attendance (contrast Â§Â§47, 93). The text is uncertain, as some mss.,
   both Greek and Latin read, was able to learn from him who was his
   attendant,' &c. The question of textual evidence requires further
   sifting. In support of the statement in the text we may cite Ap. c. Ar.
   6, where Ath. is called one of the ascetics,' which may, but need not,
   refer to something of the kind.
     __________________________________________________________________

   1. Antony you must know was by descent an Egyptian: his parents were of
   good family and possessed considerable wealth [985] , and as they were
   Christians he also was reared in the same Faith. In infancy he was
   brought up with his parents, knowing nought else but them and his home.
   But when he was grown and arrived at boyhood, and was advancing in
   years, he could not endure to learn [986] letters, not caring to
   associate with other boys; but all his desire was, as it is written of
   Jacob, to live a plain man at home [987] . With his parents he used to
   attend the Lord's House, and neither as a child was he idle nor when
   older did he despise them; but was both obedient to his father and
   mother and attentive to what was read, keeping in his heart what was
   profitable in what he heard. And though as a child brought up in
   moderate affluence, he did not trouble his parents for varied or
   luxurious fare, nor was this a source of pleasure to him; but was
   content simply with what he found nor sought anything further.

   2. After the death of his father and mother he was left alone with one
   little sister: his age was about eighteen or twenty, and on him the
   care both of home and sister rested. Now it was not six months after
   the death of his parents, and going according to custom into the Lord's
   House, he communed with himself and reflected as he walked how the
   Apostles [988] left all and followed the Saviour; and how they in the
   Acts [989] sold their possessions and brought and laid them at the
   Apostles' feet for distribution to the needy, and what and how great a
   hope was laid up for them in heaven. Pondering over these things he
   entered the church, and it happened the Gospel was being read, and he
   heard the Lord saying to the rich man [990] , If thou wouldest be
   perfect, go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor; and come
   follow Me and thou shalt have treasure in heaven.' Antony, as though
   God had put him in mind of the Saints, and the passage had been read on
   his account, went out immediately from the church, and gave the
   possessions of his forefathers to the villagers--they were three
   hundred acres [991] , productive and very fair--that they should be no
   more a clog upon himself and his sister [992] . And all the rest that
   was movable he sold, and having got together much money he gave it to
   the poor, reserving a little however for his sister's sake.

     __________________________________________________________________

   3. And again as he went into the church, hearing the Lord say in the
   Gospel [993] , be not anxious for the morrow,' he could stay no longer,
   but went out and gave those things also to the poor. Having committed
   his sister to known and faithful virgins, and put her into a convent
   [994] to be brought up, he henceforth devoted himself outside his house
   to discipline [995] , taking heed to himself and training himself with
   patience. For there were not yet so many monasteries [996] in Egypt,
   and no monk at all knew of the distant desert; but all who wished to
   give heed to themselves practised the discipline in solitude near their
   own village. Now there was then in the next village an old man who had
   lived the life of a hermit from his youth up. Antony, after he had seen
   this man, imitated him in piety. And at first he began to abide in
   places outside the village: then if he heard of a good man anywhere,
   like the prudent bee, he went forth and sought him, nor turned back to
   his own palace until he had seen him; and he returned, having got from
   the good man as it were supplies for his journey in the way of virtue.
   So dwelling there at first, he confirmed his purpose not to return to
   the abode of his fathers nor to the remembrance of his kinsfolk; but to
   keep all his desire and energy for perfecting his discipline. He
   worked, however, with his hands, having heard, he who is idle let him
   not eat [997] ,' and part he spent on bread and part he gave to the
   needy. And he was constant in prayer, knowing that a man ought to pray
   in secret unceasingly [998] . For he had given such heed to what was
   read that none of the things that were written fell from him to the
   ground, but he remembered all, and afterwards his memory served him for
   books.

   4. Thus conducting himself, Antony was beloved by all. He subjected
   himself in sincerity to the good men whom he visited, and learned
   thoroughly where each surpassed him in zeal and discipline. He observed
   the graciousness of one; the unceasing prayer of another; he took
   knowledge of another's freedom from anger and another's
   loving-kindness; he gave heed to one as he watched, to another as he
   studied; one he admired for his endurance, another for his fasting and
   sleeping on the ground; the meekness of one and the long-suffering of
   another he watched with care, while he took note of the piety towards
   Christ and the mutual love which animated all. Thus filled, he returned
   to his own place of discipline, and henceforth would strive to unite
   the qualities of each, and was eager to show in himself the virtues of
   all. With others of the same age he had no rivalry; save this only,
   that he should not be second to them in higher things. And this he did
   so as to hurt the feelings of nobody, but made them rejoice over him.
   So all they of that village and the good men in whose intimacy he was,
   when they saw that he was a man of this sort, used to call him
   God-beloved. And some welcomed him as a son, others as a brother.

   [994] Parthenon: the earliest use of the word in this sense. Perhaps a
   house occupied by Virgins is implied in Apol. c. Ar. 15. But at this
   time virgins generally lived with their families. See D.C.A. 2021^b

   5. But the devil, who hates and envies what is good, could not endure
   to see such a resolution in a youth, but endeavoured to carry out
   against him what he had been wont to effect against others. First of
   all he tried to lead him away from the discipline, whispering to him
   the remembrance of his wealth, care for his sister, claims of kindred,
   love of money, love of glory, the various pleasures of the table and
   the other relaxations of life, and at last the difficulty of virtue and
   the labour of it; he suggested also the infirmity of the body and the
   length of the time. In a word he raised in his mind a great dust of
   debate, wishing to debar him from his settled purpose. But when the
   enemy saw himself to be too weak for Antony's determination, and that
   he rather was conquered by the other's firmness, overthrown by his
   great faith and falling through his constant prayers, then at length
   putting his trust in the weapons which are [999] in the navel of his
   belly' and boasting in them--for they are his first snare for the
   young--he attacked the young man, disturbing him by night and harassing
   him by day, so that even the onlookers saw the struggle which was going
   on between them. The one would suggest foul thoughts and the other
   counter them with prayers: the one fire him with lust, the other, as
   one who seemed to blush, fortify his body with faith, prayers, and
   fasting. And the devil, unhappy wight, one night even took upon him the
   shape of a woman and imitated all her acts simply to beguile Antony.
   But he, his mind filled with Christ and the nobility inspired by Him,
   and considering the spirituality of the soul, quenched the coal of the
   other's deceit. Again the enemy suggested the ease of pleasure. But he
   like a man filled with rage and grief turned his thoughts to the
   threatened fire and the gnawing worm, and setting these in array
   against his adversary, passed through the temptation unscathed. All
   this was a source of shame to his foe. For he, deeming himself like
   God, was now mocked by a young man; and he who boasted himself against
   flesh and blood was being put to flight by a man in the flesh. For the
   Lord was working with Antony--the Lord who for our sake took flesh
   [1000] and gave the body victory over the devil, so that all who truly
   fight can say [1001] , not I but the grace of God which was with me.'

   6. At last when the dragon could not even thus overthrow Antony, but
   saw himself thrust out of his heart, gnashing his teeth as it is
   written, and as it were beside himself, he appeared to Antony like a
   black boy, taking a visible shape [1002] in accordance with the colour
   of his mind. And cringing to him, as it were, he plied him with
   thoughts no longer, for guileful as he was, he had been worsted, but at
   last spoke in human voice and said, Many I deceived, many I cast down;
   but now attacking thee and thy labours as I had many others, I proved
   weak.' When Antony asked, Who art thou who speakest thus with me? he
   answered with a lamentable voice, I am the friend of whoredom, and have
   taken upon me incitements which lead to it against the young. I am
   called the spirit of lust. How many have I deceived who wished to live
   soberly, how many are the chaste whom by my incitements I have
   over-persuaded! I am he on account of whom also the prophet reproves
   those who have fallen, saying [1003] , "Ye have been caused to err by
   the spirit of whoredom." For by me they have been tripped up. I am he
   who have so often troubled thee and have so often been overthrown by
   thee.' But Antony having given thanks to the Lord, with good courage
   said to him, Thou art very despicable then, for thou art black-hearted
   and weak as a child. Henceforth I shall have no trouble from thee
   [1004] , "for the Lord is my helper, and I shall look down on mine
   enemies."' Having heard this, the black one straightway fled,
   shuddering at the words and dreading any longer even to come near the
   man.

   7. This was Antony's first struggle against the devil, or rather this
   victory was the Saviour's work in Antony [1005] , Who condemned sin in
   the flesh that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us who
   walk not after the flesh but after the spirit.' But neither did Antony,
   although the evil one had fallen, henceforth relax his care and despise
   him; nor did the enemy as though conquered cease to lay snares for him.
   For again he went round as a lion seeking some occasion against him.
   But Antony having learned from the Scriptures that the devices [1006]
   of the devil are many, zealously continued the discipline, reckoning
   that though the devil had not been able to deceive his heart by bodily
   pleasure, he would endeavour to ensnare him by other means. For the
   demon loves sin. Wherefore more and more he repressed the body and kept
   it in subjection [1007] , lest haply having conquered on one side, he
   should be dragged down on the other. He therefore planned to accustom
   himself to a severer mode of life. And many marvelled, but he himself
   used to bear the labour easily; for the eagerness of soul, through the
   length of time it had abode in him, had wrought a good habit in him, so
   that taking but little initiation from others he shewed great zeal in
   this matter. He kept vigil to such an extent that he often continued
   the whole night without sleep; and this not once but often, to the
   marvel of others. He ate once a day, after sunset, sometimes once in
   two days, and often even in four. His food was bread and salt, his
   drink, water only. Of flesh and wine it is superfluous even to speak,
   since no such thing was found with the other earnest men. A rush mat
   served him to sleep upon, but for the most part he lay upon the bare
   ground. He would not anoint himself with oil, saying it behoved young
   men to be earnest in training and not to seek what would enervate the
   body; but they must accustom it to labour, mindful of the Apostle's
   words [1008] , when I am weak, then am I strong.' For,' said he, the
   fibre of the soul is then sound when the pleasures of the body are
   diminished.' And he had come to this truly wonderful conclusion, that
   progress in virtue, and retirement from the world for the sake of it,
   ought not to be measured by time, but by desire and fixity of purpose.'
   He at least gave no thought to the past, but day by day, as if he were
   at the beginning of his discipline, applied greater pains for
   advancement, often repeating to himself the saying of Paul [1009] :
   Forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the
   things which are before.' He was also mindful of the words spoken by
   the prophet Elias [1010] , the Lord liveth before whose presence I
   stand to-day.' For he observed that in saying to-day' the prophet did
   not compute the time that had gone by: but daily as though ever
   commencing he eagerly endeavoured to make himself fit to appear before
   God, being pure in heart and ever ready to submit to His counsel, and
   to Him alone. And he used to say to himself that from the life of the
   great Elias the hermit ought to see his own as in a mirror.

   8. Thus tightening his hold upon himself, Antony departed to the tombs,
   which happened to be at a distance from the village; and having bid one
   of his acquaintances to bring him bread at intervals of many days, he
   entered one of the tombs, and the other having shut the door on him, he
   remained within alone. And when the enemy could not endure it, but was
   even fearful that in a short time Antony would fill the desert with the
   discipline, coming one night with a multitude of demons, he so cut him
   with stripes that he lay on the ground speechless from the excessive
   pain. For he affirmed that the torture had been so excessive that no
   blows inflicted by man could ever have caused him such torment. But by
   the Providence of God--for the Lord never overlooks them that hope in
   Him--the next day his acquaintance came bringing him the loaves. And
   having opened the door and seeing him lying on the ground as though
   dead, he lifted him up and carried him to the church in the village,
   and laid him upon the ground. And many of his kinsfolk and the
   villagers sat around Antony as round a corpse. But about midnight he
   came to himself and arose, and when he saw them all asleep and his
   comrade alone watching, he motioned with his head for him to approach,
   and asked him to carry him again to the tombs without waking anybody.

   9. He was carried therefore by the man, and as he was wont, when the
   door was shut he was within alone. And he could not stand up on account
   of the blows, but he prayed as he lay. And after he had prayed, he said
   with a shout, Here am I, Antony; I flee not from your stripes, for even
   if you inflict more nothing shall separate me [1011] from the love of
   Christ. And then he sang, though a camp be set against me, my heart
   shall not be afraid [1012] .' These were the thoughts and words of this
   ascetic. But the enemy, who hates good, marvelling that after the blows
   he dared to return, called together his hounds and burst forth, Ye
   see,' said he, that neither by the spirit of lust nor by blows did we
   stay the man, but that he braves us, let us attack him in another
   fashion.' But changes of form for evil are easy for the devil, so in
   the night they made such a din that the whole of that place seemed to
   be shaken by an earthquake, and the demons as if breaking the four
   walls of the dwelling seemed to enter through them, coming in the
   likeness of beasts and creeping things. And the place was on a sudden
   filled with the forms of lions, bears, leopards, bulls, serpents, asps,
   scorpions, and wolves, and each of them was moving according to his
   nature. The lion was roaring, wishing to attack, the bull seeming to
   toss with its horns, the serpent writhing but unable to approach, and
   the wolf as it rushed on was restrained; altogether the noises of the
   apparitions, with their angry ragings, were dreadful. But Antony,
   stricken and goaded by them, felt bodily pains severer still. He lay
   watching, however, with unshaken soul, groaning from bodily anguish;
   but his mind was clear, and as in mockery he said, If there had been
   any power in you, it would have sufficed had one of you come, but since
   the Lord hath made you weak, you attempt to terrify me by numbers: and
   a proof of your weakness is that you take the shapes of brute beasts.'
   And again with boldness he said, If you are able, and have received
   power against me, delay not to attack; but if you are unable, why
   trouble me in vain? For faith in our Lord is a seal and a wall of
   safety to us.' So after many attempts they gnashed their teeth upon
   him, because they were mocking themselves rather than him.

   10. Nor was the Lord then forgetful of Antony's wrestling, but was at
   hand to help him. So looking up he saw the roof as it were opened, and
   a ray of light descending to him. The demons suddenly vanished, the
   pain of his body straightway ceased, and the building was again whole.
   But Antony feeling the help, and getting his breath again, and being
   freed from pain, besought the vision which had appeared to him, saying,
   Where wert thou? Why didst thou not appear at the beginning to make my
   pains to cease?' And a voice came to him, Antony, I was here, but I
   waited to see thy fight; wherefore since thou hast endured, and hast
   not been worsted, I will ever be a succour to thee, and will make thy
   name known everywhere.' Having heard this, Antony arose and prayed, and
   received such strength that he perceived that he had more power in his
   body than formerly. And he was then about thirty-five years old.

   11. And on the day following he went forth still more eagerly bent on
   the service of God and having fallen in with the old man he had met
   previously, he asked him to dwell with him in the desert. But when the
   other declined on account of his great age, and because as yet there
   was no such custom, Antony himself set off forthwith to the mountain.
   And yet again the enemy seeing his zeal and wishing to hinder it, cast
   in his way what seemed to be a great silver dish. But Antony, seeing
   the guile of the Evil One, stood, and having looked on the dish, he put
   the devil in it to shame, saying, Whence comes a dish in the desert?
   This road is not well-worn, nor is there here a trace of any wayfarer;
   it could not have fallen without being missed on account of its size;
   and he who had lost it having turned back, to seek it, would have found
   it, for it is a desert place. This is some wile of the devil. O thou
   Evil One, not with this shalt thou hinder my purpose; let it go with
   thee to destruction. [1013] ' And when Antony had said this it vanished
   like smoke from the face of fire.

   12. Then again as he went on he saw what was this time not visionary,
   but real gold scattered in the way. But whether the devil showed it, or
   some better power to try the athlete and show the Evil One that Antony
   truly cared nought for money, neither he told nor do we know. But it is
   certain that that which appeared was gold. And Antony marvelled at the
   quantity, but passed it by as though he were going over fire; so he did
   not even turn, but hurried on at a run to lose sight of the place. More
   and more confirmed in his purpose, he hurried to the mountain, and
   having found a fort, so long deserted that it was full of creeping
   things, on the other side of the river; he crossed over to it and dwelt
   there. The reptiles, as though some one were chasing them, immediately
   left the place. But he built up the entrance completely, having stored
   up loaves for six months--this is a custom of the Thebans, and the
   loaves often remain fresh a whole year--and as he found water within,
   he descended as into a shrine, and abode within by himself, never going
   forth nor looking at any one who came. Thus he employed a long time
   training himself, and received loaves, let down from above, twice in
   the year.

   13. But those of his acquaintances who came, since he did not permit
   them to enter, often used to spend days and nights outside, and heard
   as it were crowds within clamouring, dinning, sending forth piteous
   voices and crying, Go from what is ours. What dost thou even in the
   desert? Thou canst not abide our attack.' So at first those outside
   thought there were some men fighting with him, and that they had
   entered by ladders; but when stooping down they saw through a hole
   there was nobody, they were afraid, accounting them to be demons, and
   they called on Antony. Them he quickly heard, though he had not given a
   thought to the demons, and coming to the door he besought them to
   depart and not to be afraid, for thus,' said he, the demons make their
   seeming onslaughts against those who are cowardly. Sign yourselves
   therefore with the cross [1014] , and depart boldly, and let these make
   sport for themselves.' So they departed fortified with the sign of the
   Cross. But he remained in no wise harmed by the evil spirits, nor was
   he wearied with the contest, for there came to his aid visions from
   above, and the weakness of the foe relieved him of much trouble and
   armed him with greater zeal. For his acquaintances used often to come
   expecting to find him dead, and would hear him singing [1015] , Let God
   arise and let His enemies be scattered, let them also that hate Him
   flee before His face. As smoke vanisheth, let them vanish; as wax
   melteth before the face of fire, so let the sinners perish from the
   face of God;' and again, All nations compassed me about, and in the
   name of the Lord I requited them [1016] .'

   14. And so for nearly twenty years he continued training himself in
   solitude, never going forth, and but seldom seen by any. After this,
   when many were eager and wishful to imitate his discipline, and his
   acquaintances came and began to cast down and wrench off the door by
   force, Antony, as from a shrine, came forth initiated in the mysteries
   and filled with the Spirit of God. Then for the first time he was seen
   outside the fort by those who came to see him. And they, when they saw
   him, wondered at the sight, for he had the same habit of body as
   before, and was neither fat, like a man without exercise, nor lean from
   fasting and striving with the demons, but he was just the same as they
   had known him before his retirement. And again his soul was free from
   blemish, for it was neither contracted as if by grief, nor relaxed by
   pleasure, nor possessed by laughter or dejection, for he was not
   troubled when he beheld the crowd, nor overjoyed at being saluted by so
   many. But he was altogether even as being guided by reason, and abiding
   in a natural state. Through him the Lord healed the bodily ailments of
   many present, and cleansed others from evil spirits. And He gave grace
   to Antony in speaking, so that he consoled many that were sorrowful,
   and set those at variance at one, exhorting all to prefer the love of
   Christ before all that is in the world. And while he exhorted and
   advised them to remember the good things to come, and the
   loving-kindness of God towards us, Who spared not His own Son, but
   delivered Him up for us all [1017] ,' he persuaded many to embrace the
   solitary life. And thus it happened in the end that cells arose even in
   the mountains, and the desert was colonised by monks, who came forth
   from their own people, and enrolled themselves for the citizenship in
   the heavens.

   15. But when he was obliged to cross the Arsenoitic Canal [1018] --and
   the occasion of it was the visitation of the brethren--the canal was
   full of crocodiles. And by simply praying, he entered it, and all they
   with him, and passed over in safety. And having returned to his cell,
   he applied himself to the same noble and valiant exercises; and by
   frequent conversation he increased the eagerness of those already
   monks, stirred up in most of the rest the love of the discipline, and
   speedily by the attraction of his words cells multiplied, and he
   directed them all as a father.

   16. One day when he had gone forth because all the monks had assembled
   to him and asked to hear words from him, he spoke to them in the
   Egyptian tongue as follows: The Scriptures are enough for instruction
   [1019] , but it is a good thing to encourage one another in the faith,
   and to stir up with words. Wherefore you, as children, carry that which
   you know to your father; and I as the elder share my knowledge and what
   experience has taught me with you. Let this especially be the common
   aim of all, neither to give way having once begun, nor to faint in
   trouble, nor to say: We have lived in the discipline a long time: but
   rather as though making a beginning daily let us increase our
   earnestness. For the whole life of man is very short, measured by the
   ages to come, wherefore all our time is nothing compared with eternal
   life. And in the world everything is sold at its price, and a man
   exchanges one equivalent for another; but the promise of eternal life
   is bought for a trifle. For it is written, "The days of our life in
   them are threescore years and ten, but if they are in strength,
   fourscore years, and what is more than these is labour and sorrow
   [1020] ." Whenever, therefore, we live full fourscore years, or even a
   hundred in the discipline, not for a hundred years only shall we reign,
   but instead of a hundred we shall reign for ever and ever. And though
   we fought on earth, we shall not receive our inheritance on earth, but
   we have the promises in heaven; and having put off the body which is
   corrupt, we shall receive it incorrupt.

   17. Wherefore, children, let us not faint nor deem that the time is
   long, or that we are doing something great, "for the sufferings of this
   present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall
   be revealed to us-ward [1021] ." Nor let us think, as we look at the
   world, that we have renounced anything of much consequence, for the
   whole earth is very small compared with all the heaven. Wherefore if it
   even chanced that we were lords of all the earth and gave it all up, it
   would be nought worthy of comparison with the kingdom of heaven. For as
   if a man should despise a copper drachma to gain a hundred drachmas of
   gold; so if a man were lord of all the earth and were to renounce it,
   that which he gives up is little, and he receives a hundredfold. But if
   not even the whole earth is equal in value to the heavens, then he who
   has given up a few acres leaves as it were nothing; and even if he have
   given up a house or much gold he ought not to boast nor be
   low-spirited. Further, we should consider that even if we do not
   relinquish them for virtue's sake, still afterwards when we die we
   shall leave them behind--very often, as the Preacher saith [1022] , to
   those to whom we do not wish. Why then should we not give them up for
   virtue's sake, that we may inherit even a kingdom? Therefore let the
   desire of possession take hold of no one, for what gain is it to
   acquire these things which we cannot take with us? Why not rather get
   those things which we can take away with us--to wit, prudence, justice,
   temperance, courage, understanding, love, kindness to the poor, faith
   in Christ, freedom from wrath, hospitality? If we possess these, we
   shall find them of themselves preparing for us a welcome there in the
   land of the meek-hearted.

   18. And so from such things let a man persuade himself not to make
   light of it, especially if he considers that he himself is the servant
   of the Lord, and ought to serve his Master. Wherefore as a servant
   would not dare to say, because I worked yesterday, I will not work
   today; and considering the past will do no work in the future; but, as
   it is written in the Gospel, daily shows the same readiness to please
   his master, and to avoid risk: so let us daily abide firm in our
   discipline, knowing that if we are careless for a single day the Lord
   will not pardon us, for the sake of the past, but will be wrath against
   us for our neglect. As also we have heard in Ezekiel [1023] ; and as
   Judas because of one night destroyed his previous labour.

   19. Wherefore, children, let us hold fast our discipline, and let us
   not be careless. For in it the Lord is our fellow-worker, as it is
   written, "to all that choose the good, God worketh with them for good
   [1024] ." But to avoid being heedless, it is good to consider the word
   of the Apostle, "I die daily [1025] ." For if we too live as though
   dying daily, we shall not sin. And the meaning of that saying is, that
   as we rise day by day we should think that we shall not abide till
   evening; and again, when about to lie down to sleep, we should think
   that we shall not rise up. For our life is naturally uncertain, and
   Providence allots it to us daily. But thus ordering our daily life, we
   shall neither fall into sin, nor have a lust for anything, nor cherish
   wrath against any, nor shall we heap up treasure upon earth. But, as
   though under the daily expectation of death, we shall be without
   wealth, and shall forgive all things to all men, nor shall we retain at
   all the desire of women or of any other foul pleasure. But we shall
   turn from it as past and gone, ever striving and looking forward to the
   day of Judgment. For the greater dread and danger of torment ever
   destroys the ease of pleasure, and sets up the soul if it is like to
   fall.

   20. Wherefore having already begun and set out in the way of virtue,
   let us strive the more that we may attain those things that are before.
   And let no one turn to the things behind, like Lot's wife, all the more
   so that the Lord hath said, "No man, having put his hand to the plough,
   and turning back, is fit for the kingdom of heaven [1026] ." And this
   turning back is nought else but to feel regret, and to be once more
   worldly-minded. But fear not to hear of virtue, nor be astonished at
   the name. For it is not far from us, nor is it without ourselves, but
   it is within us, and is easy if only we are willing. That they may get
   knowledge, the Greeks live abroad and cross the sea, but we have no
   need to depart from home for the sake of the kingdom of heaven, nor to
   cross the sea for the sake of virtue. For the Lord aforetime hath said,
   "The kingdom of heaven is within you [1027] ." Wherefore virtue hath
   need at our hands of willingness alone, since it is in us and is formed
   from us. For when the soul hath its spiritual faculty in a natural
   state virtue is formed. And it is in a natural state when it remains as
   it came into existence. And when it came into existence it was fair and
   exceeding honest. For this cause Joshua, the son of Nun, in his
   exhortation said to the people, "Make straight your heart unto the Lord
   God of Israel [1028] ," and John, "Make your paths straight [1029] ."
   For rectitude of soul consists in its having its spiritual part in its
   natural state as created. But on the other hand, when it swerves and
   turns away from its natural state, that is called vice of the soul.
   Thus the matter is not difficult. If we abide as we have been made, we
   are in a state of virtue, but if we think of ignoble things we shall be
   accounted evil. If, therefore, this thing had to be acquired from
   without, it would be difficult in reality; but if it is in us, let us
   keep ourselves from foul thoughts. And as we have received the soul as
   a deposit, let us preserve it for the Lord, that He may recognise His
   work as being the same as He made it.

   21. And let us strive that wrath rule us not nor lust overcome us, for
   it is written, "The wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.
   And lust, when it hath conceived, beareth sin, and the sin when it is
   full grown bringeth forth death [1030] ." Thus living, let us keep
   guard carefully, and as it is written, "keep our hearts with all
   watchfulness [1031] ." For we have terrible and crafty foes--the evil
   spirits--and against them we wrestle, as the Apostle said, "Not against
   flesh and blood, but against the principalities and against the powers,
   against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual hosts
   of wickedness in the heavenly places [1032] ." Great is their number in
   the air around us [1033] , and they are not far from us. Now there are
   great distinctions among them; and concerning their nature and
   distinctions much could be said, but such a description is for others
   of greater powers than we possess. But at this time it is pressing and
   necessary for us only to know their wiles against ourselves.

   22. First, therefore, we must know this: that the demons have not been
   created like what we mean when we call them by that name; for God made
   nothing evil, but even they have been made good. Having fallen,
   however, from the heavenly wisdom, since then they have been grovelling
   on earth. On the one hand they deceived the Greeks with their displays,
   while out of envy of us Christians they move all things in their desire
   to hinder us from entry into the heavens; in order that we should not
   ascend up thither from whence they fell. Thus there is need of much
   prayer and of discipline, that when a man has received through the
   Spirit the gift of discerning spirits, he may have power to recognise
   their characteristics: which of them are less and which more evil; of
   what nature is the special pursuit of each, and how each of them is
   overthrown and cast out. For their villainies and the changes in their
   plots are many. The blessed Apostle and his followers knew such things
   when they said, "for we are not ignorant of his devices [1034] ;" and
   we, from the temptations we have suffered at their hands, ought to
   correct one another under them. Wherefore I, having had proof of them,
   speak as to children.

   23. The demons, therefore, if they see all Christians, and monks
   especially, labouring cheerfully and advancing, first make an attack by
   temptation and place hindrances to hamper our way, to wit, evil
   thoughts. But we need not fear their suggestions, for by prayer,
   fasting, and faith in the Lord their attack immediately fails. But even
   when it does they cease not, but knavishly by subtlety come on again.
   For when they cannot deceive the heart openly with foul pleasures they
   approach in different guise, and thenceforth shaping displays they
   attempt to strike fear, changing their shapes, taking the forms of
   women, wild beasts, creeping things, gigantic bodies, and troops of
   soldiers. But not even then need ye fear their deceitful displays. For
   they are nothing and quickly disappear, especially if a man fortify
   himself beforehand with faith and the sign of the cross [1035] . Yet
   are they bold and very shameless, for if thus they are worsted they
   make an onslaught in another manner, and pretend to prophesy and
   foretell the future, and to shew themselves of a height reaching to the
   roof and of great breadth; that they may stealthily catch by such
   displays those who could not be deceived by their arguments. If here
   also they find the soul strengthened by faith and a hopeful mind, then
   they bring their leader to their aid.

   24. And he said they often appeared as the Lord revealed the devil to
   Job, saying, "His eyes are as the morning star. From his mouth proceed
   burning lamps and hearths of fire are cast forth. The smoke of a
   furnace blazing with the fire of coals proceeds from his nostrils. His
   breath is coals and from his mouth issues flame [1036] ." When the
   prince of the demons appears in this wise, the crafty one, as I said
   before, strikes terror by speaking great things, as again the Lord
   convicted him saying to Job, for "he counteth iron as straw, and brass
   as rotten wood, yea he counteth the sea as a pot of ointment, and the
   depth of the abyss as a captive, and the abyss as a covered walk [1037]
   ." And by the prophet, "the enemy said, I will pursue and overtake
   [1038] ," and again by another, "I will grasp the whole world in my
   hand as a nest, and take it up as eggs that have been left [1039] ."
   Such, in a word, are their boasts and professions that they may deceive
   the godly. But not even then ought we, the faithful, to fear his
   appearance or give heed to his words. For he is a liar and speaketh of
   truth never a word. And though speaking words so many and so great in
   his boldness, without doubt, like a dragon he was drawn with a hook by
   the Saviour [1040] , and as a beast of burden he received the halter
   round his nostrils, and as a runaway his nostrils were bound with a
   ring, and his lips bored with an armlet [1041] . And he was bound by
   the Lord as a sparrow, that we should mock him. And with him are placed
   the demons his fellows, like serpents and scorpions to be trodden
   underfoot by us Christians. And the proof of this is that we now live
   opposed to him. For he who threatened to dry the sea and seize upon the
   world, behold now cannot stay our discipline, nor even me speaking
   against him. Let us then heed not his words, for he is a liar: and let
   us not fear his visions, seeing that they themselves are deceptive. For
   that which appears in them is no true light, but they are rather the
   preludes and likenesses of the fire prepared for the demons who attempt
   to terrify men with those flames in which they themselves will be
   burned. Doubtless they appear; but in a moment disappear again, hurting
   none of the faithful, but bringing with them the likeness of that fire
   which is about to receive themselves. Wherefore it is unfitting that we
   should fear them on account of these things; for through the grace of
   Christ all their practices are in vain.

   25. Again they are treacherous, and are ready to change themselves into
   all forms and assume all appearances. Very often also without appearing
   they imitate the music of harp and voice, and recall the words of
   Scripture. Sometimes, too, while we are reading they immediately repeat
   many times, like an echo, what is read. They arouse us from our sleep
   to prayers; and this constantly, hardly allowing us to sleep at all. At
   another time they assume the appearance of monks and feign the speech
   of holy men, that by their similarity they may deceive and thus drag
   their victims where they will. But no heed must be paid them even if
   they arouse to prayer, even if they counsel us not to eat at all, even
   though they seem to accuse and cast shame upon us for those things
   which once they allowed. For they do this not for the sake of piety or
   truth, but that they may carry off the simple to despair; and that they
   may say the discipline is useless, and make men loathe the solitary
   life as a trouble and burden, and hinder those who in spite of them
   walk in it.

   26. Wherefore the prophet sent by the Lord declared them to be
   wretched, saying: "Wo is he who giveth his neighbours to drink muddy
   destruction [1042] ." For such practices and devices are subversive of
   the way which leads to virtue. And the Lord Himself, even if the demons
   spoke the truth,--for they said truly "Thou art the Son of God [1043]
   "--still bridled their mouths and suffered them not to speak; lest
   haply they should sow their evil along with the truth, and that He
   might accustom us never to give heed to them even though they appear to
   speak what is true. For it is unseemly that we, having the holy
   Scriptures and freedom from the Saviour, should be taught by the devil
   who hath not kept his own order but hath gone from one mind to another
   [1044] . Wherefore even when he uses the language of Scripture He
   forbids him, saying: "But to the sinner said God, Wherefore dost thou
   declare My ordinances and takest My covenant in thy mouth [1045] ?" For
   the demons do all things--they prate, they confuse, they dissemble,
   they confound--to deceive the simple. They din, laugh madly, and
   whistle; but if no heed is paid to them forthwith they weep and lament
   as though vanquished.'

   27. The Lord therefore, as God, stayed the mouths of the demons: and it
   is fitting that we, taught by the saints, should do like them and
   imitate their courage. For they when they saw these things used to say:
   "When the sinner rose against me, I was dumb and humble, and kept
   silence from good words [1046] ." And again: "But I was as a deaf man
   and heard not, and as a dumb man who openeth not his mouth, and I
   became as a man who heareth not [1047] ." So let us neither hear them
   as being strangers to us, nor give heed to them even though they arouse
   us to prayer and speak concerning fasting. But let us rather apply
   ourselves to our resolve of discipline, and let us not be deceived by
   them who do all things in deceit, even though they threaten death. For
   they are weak and can do nought but threaten.

   28. Already in passing I have spoken on these things, and now I must
   not shrink from speaking on them at greater length, for to put you in
   remembrance will be a source of safety. Since the Lord visited earth
   [1048] , the enemy is fallen and his powers weakened. Wherefore
   although he could do nothing, still like a tyrant, he did not bear his
   fall quietly, but threatened, though his threats were words only. And
   let each one of you consider this, and he will be able to despise the
   demons. Now if they were hampered with such bodies as we are, it would
   be possible for them to say, "Men when they are hidden we cannot find,
   but whenever we do find them we do them hurt." And we also by lying in
   concealment could escape them, shutting the doors against them. But if
   they are not of such a nature as this, but are able to enter in, though
   the doors be shut, and haunt all the air, both they and their leader
   the devil, and are wishful for evil and ready to injure; and, as the
   Saviour said, "From the beginning the devil is a manslayer and a father
   of vice [1049] ;" while we, though this is so, are alive, and spend our
   lives all the more in opposing him; it is plain they are powerless. For
   place is no hindrance to their plots, nor do they look on us as friends
   that they should spare us; nor are they lovers of good that they should
   amend. But on the contrary they are evil, and nothing is so much sought
   after by them as wounding them that love virtue and fear God. But since
   they have no power to effect anything, they do nought but threaten. But
   if they could, they would not hesitate, but forthwith work evil (for
   all their desire is set on this), and especially against us. Behold now
   we are gathered together and speak against them, and they know when we
   advance they grow weak. If therefore they had power they would permit
   none of us Christians to live, for godliness is an abomination to a
   sinner [1050] . But since they can do nothing they inflict the greater
   wounds on themselves; for they can fulfil none of their threats. Next
   this ought to be considered, that we may be in no fear of them: that if
   they had the power they would not come in crowds, nor fashion displays,
   nor with change of form would they frame deceits. But it would suffice
   that one only should come and accomplish that which he was both able
   and willing to do: especially as every one who has the power neither
   slays with display nor strikes fear with tumult, but forthwith makes
   full use of his authority as he wishes. But the demons as they have no
   power are like actors on the stage changing their shape and frightening
   children with tumultuous apparition and various forms: from which they
   ought rather to be despised as shewing their weakness. At least the
   true angel of the Lord sent against the Assyrian had no need for
   tumults nor displays from without, nor noises nor rattlings, but in
   quiet he used his power and forthwith destroyed a hundred and
   eighty-five thousand. But demons like these, who have no power, try to
   terrify at least by their displays [1051] .

   29. But if any one having in mind the history of Job [1052] should say,
   Why then hath the devil gone forth and accomplished all things against
   him; and stripped him of all his possessions, and slew his children,
   and smote him with evil ulcers? let such a one, on the other hand,
   recognise that the devil was not the strong man, but God who delivered
   Job to him to be tried. Certainly he had no power to do anything, but
   he asked, and having received it, he hath wrought what he did. So also
   from this the enemy is the more to be condemned, for although willing
   he could not prevail against one just man. For if he could have, he
   would not have asked permission. But having asked not once but also a
   second time, he shows his weakness and want of power. And it is no
   wonder if he could do nothing against Job, when destruction would not
   have come even on his cattle had not God allowed it. And he has not the
   power over swine, for as it is written in the Gospel, they besought the
   Lord, saying, "Let us enter the swine [1053] ." But if they had power
   not even against swine, much less have they any over men formed [1054]
   in the image of God.

   30. So then we ought to fear God only, and despise the demons, and be
   in no fear of them. But the more they do these things the more let us
   intensify our discipline against them, for a good life and faith in God
   is a great weapon. At any rate they fear the fasting, the
   sleeplessness, the prayers, the meekness, the quietness, the contempt
   of money and vainglory, the humility, the love of the poor, the alms,
   the freedom from anger of the ascetics, and, chief of all, their piety
   towards Christ. Wherefore they do all things that they may not have any
   that trample on them, knowing the grace given to the faithful against
   them by the Saviour, when He says, "Behold I have given to you power to
   tread upon serpents and scorpions, and upon all the power of the enemy
   [1055] ."

   31. Wherefore if they pretend to foretell the future, let no one give
   heed, for often they announce beforehand that the brethren are coming
   days after. And they do come. The demons, however, do this not from any
   care for the hearers, but to gain their trust, and that then at length,
   having got them in their power, they may destroy them. Whence we must
   give no heed to them, but ought rather to confute them when speaking,
   since we do not need them. For what wonder is it, if with more subtle
   bodies than men have [1056] , when they have seen them start on their
   journey, they surpass them in speed, and announce their coming? Just as
   a horseman getting a start of a man on foot announces the arrival of
   the latter beforehand, so in this there is no need for us to wonder at
   them. For they know none of those things which are not yet in
   existence; but God only is He who knoweth all things before their birth
   [1057] . But these, like thieves, running off first with what they see,
   proclaim it: to how many already have they announced our business--that
   we are assembled together, and discuss measures against them, before
   any one of us could go and tell these things. This in good truth a
   fleet-footed boy could do, getting far ahead of one less swift. But
   what I mean is this. If any one begins to walk from the Thebaid, or
   from any other district, before he begins to walk, they do not know
   whether he will walk. But when they have seen him walking they run on,
   and before he comes up report his approach. And so it falls out that
   after a few days the travellers arrive. But often the walkers turn
   back, and the demons prove false.'

   32. So, too, with respect to the water of the river, they sometimes
   make foolish statements. For having seen that there has been much rain
   in the regions of Ethiopia, and knowing that they are the cause of the
   flood of the river before the water has come to Egypt they run on and
   announce it. And this men could have told, if they had as great power
   of running as the demons. And as David's spy [1058] going up to a lofty
   place saw the man approaching better than one who stayed down below,
   and the forerunner himself announced, before the others came up, not
   those things which had not taken place, but those things which were
   already on the way and were being accomplished, so these also prefer to
   labour, and declare what is happening to others simply for the sake of
   deceiving them. If, however, Providence meantime plans anything
   different for the waters or wayfarers--for Providence can do this--the
   demons are deceived, and those who gave heed to them cheated.'

   33. Thus in days gone by arose the oracles of the Greeks, and thus they
   were led astray by the demons. But thus also thenceforth their
   deception was brought to an end by the coming of the Lord [1059] , who
   brought to nought the demons and their devices. For they know nothing
   of themselves, but, like thieves, what they get to know from others
   they pass on, and guess at rather than foretell things. Therefore if
   sometimes they speak the truth, let no one marvel at them for this. For
   experienced physicians also, since they see the same malady in
   different people, often foretell what it is, making it out by their
   acquaintance with it. Pilots, too, and farmers, from their familiarity
   with the weather, tell at a glance the state of the atmosphere, and
   forecast whether it will be stormy or fine. And no one would say that
   they do this by inspiration, but from experience and practice. So if
   the demons sometimes do the same by guesswork, let no one wonder at it
   or heed them. For what use to the hearers is it to know from them what
   is going to happen before the time? Or what concern have we to know
   such things, even if the knowledge be true? For it is not productive of
   virtue, nor is it any token of goodness. For none of us is judged for
   what he knows not, and no one is called blessed because he hath
   learning and knowledge. But each one will be called to judgment in
   these points--whether he have kept the faith and truly observed the
   commandments.'

   34. Wherefore there is no need to set much value on these things, nor
   for the sake of them to practise a life of discipline and labour; but
   that living well we may please God. And we neither ought to pray to
   know the future, nor to ask for it as the reward of our discipline; but
   our prayer should be that the Lord may be our fellow-helper for victory
   over the devil. And if even once we have a desire to know the future,
   let us be pure in mind, for I believe that if a soul is perfectly pure
   and in its natural state, it is able [1060] , being clear-sighted, to
   see more and further than the demons--for it has the Lord who reveals
   to it--like the soul of Elisha, which saw what was done [1061] by
   Gehazi, and beheld the hosts [1062] standing on its side.'

   35. When, therefore, they come by night to you and wish to tell the
   future, or say, "we are the angels," give no heed, for they lie. Yea
   even if they praise your discipline and call you blessed, hear them
   not, and have no dealings with them; but rather sign yourselves and
   your houses, and pray, and you shall see them vanish. For they are
   cowards, and greatly fear the sign of the Lord's Cross, since of a
   truth in it the Saviour stripped them, and made an example of them
   [1063] . But if they shamelessly stand their ground, capering and
   changing their forms of appearance, fear them not, nor shrink, nor heed
   them as though they were good spirits. For the presence either of the
   good or evil by the help of God can easily be distinguished. The vision
   of the holy ones is not fraught with distraction: "For they will not
   strive, nor cry, nor shall any one hear their voice [1064] ." But it
   comes so quietly and gently that immediately joy, gladness and courage
   arise in the soul. For the Lord who is our joy is with them, and the
   power of God the Father. And the thoughts of the soul remain unruffled
   and undisturbed, so that it, enlightened as it were with rays, beholds
   by itself those who appear. For the love of what is divine and of the
   things to come possesses it, and willingly it would be wholly joined
   with them if it could depart along with them. But if, being men, some
   fear the vision of the good, those who appear immediately take fear
   away; as Gabriel [1065] did in the case of Zacharias, and as the angel
   [1066] did who appeared to the women at the holy sepulchre, and as He
   did who said to the shepherds in the Gospel, "Fear not." For their fear
   arose not from timidity, but from the recognition of the presence of
   superior beings. Such then is the nature of the visions of the holy
   ones.'

   36. But the inroad and the display of the evil spirits is fraught with
   confusion, with din, with sounds and cryings such as the disturbance of
   boorish youths or robbers would occasion. From which arise fear in the
   heart, tumult and confusion of thought, dejection, hatred towards them
   who live a life of discipline, indifference, grief, remembrance of
   kinsfolk and fear of death, and finally desire of evil things,
   disregard of virtue and unsettled habits. Whenever, therefore, ye have
   seen ought and are afraid, if your fear is immediately taken away and
   in place of it comes joy unspeakable, cheerfulness, courage, renewed
   strength, calmness of thought and all those I named before, boldness
   and love toward God,--take courage and pray. For joy and a settled
   state of soul show the holiness of him who is present. Thus Abraham
   beholding the Lord rejoiced [1067] ; so also John [1068] at the voice
   of Mary, the God-bearer [1069] , leaped for gladness. But if at the
   appearance of any there is confusion, knocking without, worldly
   display, threats of death and the other things which I have already
   mentioned, know ye that it is an onslaught of evil spirits.'

   37. And let this also be a token for you: whenever the soul remains
   fearful there is a presence of the enemies. For the demons do not take
   away the fear of their presence as the great archangel Gabriel did for
   Mary and Zacharias, and as he did who appeared to the women at the
   tomb; but rather whenever they see men afraid they increase their
   delusions that men may be terrified the more; and at last attacking
   they mock them, saying, "fall down and worship." Thus they deceived the
   Greeks, and thus by them they were considered gods, falsely so called.
   But the Lord did not suffer us to be deceived by the devil, for He
   rebuked him whenever he framed such delusions against Him, saying: "Get
   behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy
   God, and Him only shalt thou serve [1070] ." More and more, therefore,
   let the deceiver be despised by us; for what the Lord hath said, this
   for our sakes He hath done: that the demons hearing like words from us
   may be put to flight through the Lord who rebuked them in those words.'

   38. And it is not fitting to boast at the casting forth of the demons,
   nor to be uplifted by the healing of diseases: nor is it fitting that
   he who casts out devils should alone be highly esteemed, while he who
   casts them not out should be considered nought. But let a man learn the
   discipline of each one and either imitate, rival, or correct it. For
   the working of signs is not ours but the Saviour's work: and so He said
   to His disciples: "Rejoice not that the demons are subject to you, but
   that your names are written in the heavens [1071] ." For the fact that
   our names are written in heaven is a proof of our virtuous life, but to
   cast out demons is a favour of the Saviour who granted it. Wherefore to
   those who boasted in signs but not in virtue, and said: "Lord, in Thy
   name did we not cast out demons, and in Thy name did many mighty works
   [1072] ?" He answered, "Verily I say unto you, I know you not;" for the
   Lord knoweth not the ways of the wicked. But we ought always to pray,
   as I said above, that we may receive the gift of discerning spirits;
   that, as it is written [1073] , we may not believe every spirit.'

   39. I should have liked to speak no further and to say nothing from my
   own promptings, satisfied with what I have said: but lest you should
   think that I speak at random and believe that I detail these things
   without experience or truth; for this cause even though I should become
   as a fool, yet the Lord who heareth knoweth the clearness of my
   conscience, and that it is not for my own sake, but on account of your
   affection towards me and at your petition that I again tell what I saw
   of the practices of evil spirits. How often have they called me blessed
   and I have cursed them in the name of the Lord! How often have they
   predicted the rising of the river, and I answered them, "What have you
   to do with it?" Once they came threatening and surrounded me like
   soldiers in full armour. At another time they filled the house with
   horses, wild beasts and creeping things, and I sang: "Some in chariots
   and some in horses, but we will boast in the name of the Lord our God
   [1074] ;" and at the prayers they were turned to flight by the Lord.
   Once they came in darkness, bearing the appearance of a light, and
   said, "We are come to give thee a light, Antony." But I closed my eyes
   and prayed, and immediately the light of the wicked ones was quenched.
   And a few months after they came as though singing psalms and babbling
   the words of Scripture, "But I like a deaf man, heard not [1075] ."
   Once they shook the cell [1076] with an earthquake, but I continued
   praying with unshaken heart. And after this they came again making
   noises, whistling and dancing. But as I prayed and lay singing psalms
   to myself they forthwith began to lament and weep, as if their strength
   had failed them. But I gave glory to the Lord who had brought down and
   made an example of their daring and madness.'

   40. Once a demon exceeding high appeared with pomp, and dared to say,
   "I am the power of God and I am Providence, what dost thou wish that I
   shall give thee?" But I then so much the more breathed upon him [1077]
   , and spoke the name of Christ, and set about to smite him. And I
   seemed to have smitten him, and forthwith he, big as he was, together
   with all his demons, disappeared at the name of Christ. At another
   time, while I was fasting, he came full of craft, under the semblance
   of a monk, with what seemed to be loaves, and gave me counsel, saying,
   "Eat and cease from thy many labours. Thou also art a man and art like
   to fall sick." But I, perceiving his device, rose up to pray; and he
   endured it not, for he departed, and through the door there seemed to
   go out as it were smoke. How often in the desert has he displayed what
   resembled gold, that I should only touch it and look on it. But I sang
   psalms against him, and he vanished away. Often they would beat me with
   stripes, and I repeated again and again, "Nothing shall separate me
   from the love of Christ [1078] ," and at this they rather fell to
   beating one another. Nor was it I that stayed them and destroyed their
   power, but it was the Lord, who said, "I beheld Satan as lightning fall
   from Heaven; [1079] " but I, children, mindful of the Apostle's words,
   transferred [1080] this to myself, that you might learn not to faint in
   discipline, nor to fear the devil nor the delusions of the demons.'

   41. And since I have become a fool in detailing these things, receive
   this also as an aid to your safety and fearlessness; and believe me for
   I do not lie. Once some one knocked at the door of my cell, and going
   forth I saw one who seemed of great size and tall. Then when I
   enquired, "Who art thou?" he said, "I am Satan." Then when I said, "Why
   art thou here?" he answered, "Why do the monks and all other Christians
   blame me undeservedly? Why do they curse me hourly?" Then I answered,
   "Wherefore dost thou trouble them?" He said, "I am not he who troubles
   them, but they trouble themselves, for I am become weak. Have they not
   read [1081] ," "The swords of the enemy have come to an end, and thou
   hast destroyed the cities?" "I have no longer a place, a weapon, a
   city. The Christians are spread everywhere, and at length even the
   desert is filled with monks. Let them take heed to themselves, and let
   them not curse me undeservedly." Then I marvelled at the grace of the
   Lord, and said to him: "Thou who art ever a liar and never speakest the
   truth, this at length, even against thy will, thou hast truly spoken.
   For the coming of Christ hath made thee weak, and He hath cast thee
   down and stripped thee." But he having heard the Saviour's name, and
   not being able to bear the burning from it, vanished.'

   42. If, therefore, the devil himself confesses that his power is gone,
   we ought utterly to despise both him and his demons; and since the
   enemy with his hounds has but devices of this sort, we, having got to
   know their weakness, are able to despise them. Wherefore let us not
   despond after this fashion, nor let us have a thought of cowardice in
   our heart, nor frame fears for ourselves, saying, I am afraid lest a
   demon should come and overthrow me; lest he should lift me up and cast
   me down; or lest rising against me on a sudden he confound me. Such
   thoughts let us not have in mind at all, nor let us be sorrowful as
   though we were perishing; but rather let us be courageous and rejoice
   always, believing that we are safe. Let us consider in our soul that
   the Lord is with us, who put the evil spirits to flight and broke their
   power. Let us consider and lay to heart that while the Lord is with us,
   our foes can do us no hurt. For when they come they approach us in a
   form corresponding to the state in which they discover us [1082] , and
   adapt their delusions to the condition of mind in which they find us.
   If, therefore, they find us timid and confused, they forthwith beset
   the place, like robbers, having found it unguarded; and what we of
   ourselves are thinking, they do, and more also. For if they find us
   faint-hearted and cowardly, they mightily increase our terror, by their
   delusions and threats; and with these the unhappy soul is thenceforth
   tormented. But if they see us rejoicing in the Lord, contemplating the
   bliss of the future, mindful of the Lord, deeming all things in His
   hand, and that no evil spirit has any strength against the Christian,
   nor any power at all over any one--when they behold the soul fortified
   with these thoughts--they are discomfited and turned backwards. Thus
   the enemy, seeing Job fenced round with them, withdrew from him; but
   finding Judas unguarded, him he took captive. Thus if we are wishful to
   despise the enemy, let us ever ponder over the things of the Lord, and
   let the soul ever rejoice in hope. And we shall see the snares of the
   demon are like smoke, and the evil ones themselves flee rather than
   pursue. For they are, as I said before, exceeding fearful, ever looking
   forward to the fire prepared for them.'

   43. And for your fearlessness against them hold this sure
   sign--whenever there is any apparition, be not prostrate with fear, but
   whatsoever it be, first boldly ask, Who art thou? And from whence
   comest thou? And if it should be a vision of holy ones they will assure
   you, and change your fear into joy. But if the vision should be from
   the devil, immediately it becomes feeble, beholding your firm purpose
   of mind. For merely to ask, Who art thou [1083] ? and whence comest
   thou? is a proof of coolness. By thus asking, the son of Nun learned
   who his helper was; nor did the enemy escape the questioning of Daniel
   [1084] .'

   44. While Antony was thus speaking all rejoiced; in some the love of
   virtue increased, in others carelessness was thrown aside, the
   self-conceit of others was stopped; and all were persuaded to despise
   the assaults of the Evil One, and marvelled at the grace given to
   Antony from the Lord for the discerning of spirits. So their cells were
   in the mountains, like filled with holy bands of men who sang psalms,
   loved reading, fasted, prayed, rejoiced in the hope of things to come,
   laboured in alms-giving, and preserved love and harmony one with
   another. And truly it was possible, as it were, to behold a land set by
   itself, filled with piety and justice. For then there was neither the
   evil-doer, nor the injured, nor the reproaches of the tax-gatherer: but
   instead a multitude of ascetics; and the one purpose of them all was to
   aim at virtue. So that any one beholding the cells again, and seeing
   such good order among the monks, would lift up his voice and say, How
   goodly are thy dwellings, O Jacob, and thy tents, O Israel; as shady
   glens and as a garden [1085] by a river; as tents which the Lord hath
   pitched, and like cedars near waters [1086] .'

   45. Antony, however, according to his custom, returned alone to his own
   cell, increased his discipline, and sighed daily as he thought of the
   mansions in Heaven, having his desire fixed on them, and pondering over
   the shortness of man's life. And he used to eat and sleep, and go about
   all other bodily necessities with shame when he thought of the
   spiritual faculties of the soul. So often, when about to eat with any
   other hermits, recollecting the spiritual food, he begged to be
   excused, and departed far off from them, deeming it a matter for shame
   if he should be seen eating by others. He used, however, when by
   himself, to eat through bodily necessity, but often also with the
   brethren; covered with shame on these occasions, yet speaking boldly
   words of help. And he used to say that it behoved a man to give all his
   time to his soul rather than his body, yet to grant a short space to
   the body through its necessities; but all the more earnestly to give up
   the whole remainder to the soul and seek its profit, that it might not
   be dragged down by the pleasures of the body, but, on the contrary, the
   body might be in subjection to the soul. For this is that which was
   spoken by the Saviour: Be not anxious for your life what ye shall eat,
   nor for your body what ye shall put on. And do ye seek not what ye
   shall eat, or what ye shall drink, and be not of a doubtful mind. For
   all these things the nations of the world seek after. But your Father
   knoweth that ye have need of all these things. Howbeit seek ye first
   His Kingdom, and all these things shall be added unto you [1087] .'

   46. After this the Church was seized by the persecution which then
   [1088] took place under Maximinus, and when the holy martyrs were led
   to Alexandria, Antony also followed, leaving his cell, and saying, Let
   us go too, that if called, we may contend or behold them that are
   contending. And he longed to suffer martyrdom, but not being willing to
   give himself up, he ministered to the confessors in the mines and in
   the prisons. And he was very zealous in the judgment hall to stir up to
   readiness those who were summoned when in their contest, while those
   who were being martyred he received and brought on their way until they
   were perfected. The judge, therefore, beholding the fearlessness of
   Antony and his companions, and their zeal in this matter, commanded
   that no monk should appear in the judgment hall, nor remain at all in
   the city. So all the rest thought it good to hide themselves that day,
   but Antony gave so little heed to the command that he washed his
   garment, and stood all next day on a raised place before them, and
   appeared in his best before the governor. Therefore when all the rest
   wondered at this, and the governor saw and passed by with his array, he
   stood fearlessly, shewing the readiness of us Christians. For, as I
   said before, he prayed himself to be a martyr, wherefore he seemed as
   one grieved that he had not borne his witness. But the Lord was keeping
   him for our profit and that of others, that he should become a teacher
   to many of the discipline which he had learned from the Scriptures. For
   many only beholding his manner of life were eager to be imitators of
   his ways. So he again ministered as usual to the confessors, and as
   though he were their fellow captive he laboured in his ministry.

   47. And when at last the persecution ceased, and the blessed Bishop
   Peter [1089] had borne his testimony, Antony departed, and again
   withdrew to his cell, and was there daily a martyr to his conscience,
   and contending in the conflicts of faith. And his discipline was much
   severer, for he was ever fasting, and he had a garment of hair on the
   inside, while the outside was skin, which he kept until his end. And he
   neither bathed his body with water to free himself from filth, nor did
   he ever wash his feet, nor even endure so much as to put them into
   water, unless compelled by necessity. Nor did any one even see him
   unclothed, nor his body naked at all, except after his death, when he
   was buried.

   48. When therefore he had retired and determined to fix a time, after
   which neither to go forth himself nor admit anybody, Martinian, a
   military officer, came and disturbed Antony. For he had a daughter
   afflicted with an evil spirit. But when he continued for a long while
   knocking at the door, and asking him to come out and pray to God for
   his child, Antony, not bearing to open, looked out from above and said,
   Man, why dost thou call on me? I also am a man even as you. But if you
   believe on Christ whom I serve, go, and according as you believe, pray
   to God, and it shall come to pass.' Straightway, therefore, he
   departed, believing and calling upon Christ, and he received his
   daughter cleansed from the devil. Many other things also through Antony
   the Lord did, who saith, Seek and it shall be given unto you [1090] .'
   For many of the sufferers, when he would not open his door, slept
   outside his cell, and by their faith and sincere prayers were healed.

   49. But when he saw himself beset by many, and not suffered to withdraw
   himself according to his intent as he wished, fearing because of the
   signs which the Lord wrought by him, that either he should be puffed
   up, or that some other should think of him above what he ought to
   think, he considered and set off to go into the upper Thebaid, among
   those to whom he was unknown. And having received loaves from the
   brethren, he sat down by the bank of the river, looking whether a boat
   would go by, that, having embarked thereon, he might go up the river
   with them. While he was considering these things, a voice came to him
   from above, Antony, whither goest thou and wherefore?' But he no way
   disturbed, but as he had been accustomed to be called [1091] often
   thus, giving ear to it, answered, saying, Since the multitude permit me
   not to be still, I wish to go into the upper Thebaid on account of the
   many hindrances that come upon me here, and especially because they
   demand of me things beyond my power.' But the voice said unto him, Even
   though you should go into the Thebaid, or even though, as you have in
   mind, you should go down to the Bucolia [1092] , you will have to
   endure more, aye, double the amount of toil. But if you wish really to
   be in quiet, depart now into the inner desert.' And when Antony said,
   Who will show me the way for I know it not?' immediately the voice
   pointed out to him Saracens about to go that way. So Antony approached,
   and drew near them, and asked that he might go with them into the
   desert. And they, as though they had been commanded by Providence,
   received him willingly. And having journeyed with them three days and
   three nights, he came to a very lofty mountain, and at the foot of the
   mountain ran a clear spring, whose waters were sweet and very cold;
   outside there was a plain and a few uncared-for palm trees.

   50. Antony then, as it were, moved by God, loved the place [1093] , for
   this was the spot which he who had spoken with him by the banks of the
   river had pointed out. So having first received loaves from his fellow
   travellers, he abode in the mountain alone, no one else being with him.
   And recognising it as his own home, he remained in that place for the
   future. But the Saracens, having seen the earnestness of Antony,
   purposely used to journey that way, and joyfully brought him loaves,
   while now and then the palm trees also afforded him a poor and frugal
   relish. But after this, the brethren learning of the place, like
   children mindful of their father, took care to send to him. But when
   Antony saw that the bread was the cause of trouble and hardships to
   some of them, to spare the monks this, he resolved to ask some of those
   who came to bring him a spade, an axe, and a little corn. And when
   these were brought, he went over the land round the mountain, and
   having found a small plot of suitable ground, tilled it; and having a
   plentiful supply of water for watering, he sowed. This doing year by
   year, he got his bread from thence, rejoicing that thus he would be
   troublesome to no one, and because he kept himself from being a burden
   to anybody. But after this, seeing again that people came, he
   cultivated a few pot-herbs, that he who came to him might have some
   slight solace after the labour of that hard journey. At first, however,
   the wild beasts in the desert, coming because of the water, often
   injured his seeds and husbandry. But he, gently laying hold of one of
   them, said to them all, Why do you hurt me, when I hurt none of you?
   Depart, and in the name of the Lord come not nigh this spot.' And from
   that time forward, as though fearful of his command, they no more came
   near the place.

   51. So he was alone in the inner mountain, spending his time in prayer
   and discipline. And the brethren who served him asked that they might
   come every month and bring him olives, pulse and oil, for by now he was
   an old man. There then he passed his life, and endured such great
   wrestlings, Not against flesh and blood [1094] ,' as it is written, but
   against opposing demons, as we learned from those who visited him. For
   there they heard tumults, many voices, and, as it were, the clash of
   arms. At night they saw the mountain become full of wild beasts, and
   him also fighting as though against visible beings, and praying against
   them. And those who came to him he encouraged, while kneeling he
   contended and prayed to the Lord. Surely it was a marvellous thing that
   a man, alone in such a desert, feared neither the demons who rose up
   against him, nor the fierceness of the four-footed beasts and creeping
   things, for all they were so many. But in truth, as it is written, He
   trusted in the Lord as Mount Sion [1095] ,' with a mind unshaken and
   undisturbed; so that the demons rather fled from him, and the wild
   beasts, as it is written [1096] , kept peace with him.'

   52. The devil, therefore, as David says in the Psalms [1097] , observed
   Antony and gnashed his teeth against him. But Antony was consoled by
   the Saviour and continued unhurt by his wiles and varied devices. As he
   was watching in the night the devil sent wild beasts against him. And
   almost all the hyenas in that desert came forth from their dens and
   surrounded him; and he was in the midst, while each one threatened to
   bite. Seeing that it was a trick of the enemy he said to them all: If
   ye have received power against me I am ready to be devoured by you; but
   if ye were sent against me by demons, stay not, but depart, for I am a
   servant of Christ.' When Antony said this they fled, driven by that
   word as with a whip.

   53. A few days after, as he was working (for he was careful to work
   hard), some one stood at the door and pulled the plait which he was
   working, for he used to weave baskets, which he gave to those who came
   in return for what they brought him. And rising up he saw a beast like
   a man to the thighs but having legs and feet like those of an ass. And
   Antony only signed himself and said, I am a servant of Christ. If thou
   art sent against me, behold I am here.' But the beast together with his
   evil spirits fled, so that, through his speed, he fell and died. And
   the death of the beast was the fall of the demons. For they strove in
   all manner of ways to lead Antony from the desert and were not able.

   54. And once being asked by the monks to come down and visit them and
   their abodes after a time, he journeyed with those who came to him. And
   a camel carried the loaves and the water for them. For all that desert
   is dry, and there is no water at all that is fit to drink, save in that
   mountain from whence they drew the water, and in which Antony's cell
   was. So when the water failed them on their way, and the heat was very
   great, they all were in danger. For having gone round the neighbourhood
   and finding no water, they could walk no further, but lay on the ground
   and despairing of themselves, let the camel go. But the old man seeing
   that they were all in jeopardy, groaning in deep grief, departed a
   little way from them, and kneeling down he stretched forth his hands
   and prayed. And immediately the Lord made water to well forth where he
   had stood praying, and so all drank and were revived. And having filled
   their bottles they sought the camel and found her, for the rope
   happened to have caught in a stone and so was held fast. Having led it
   and watered it they placed the bottles on its back and finished their
   journey in safety. And when he came to the outer cells all saluted him,
   looking on him as a father. And he too, as though bringing supplies
   from the mountain, entertained them with his words and gave them a
   share of help. And again there was joy in the mountains, zeal for
   improvement and consolation through their mutual faith. Antony also
   rejoiced when he beheld the earnestness of the monks, and his sister
   grown old in virginity, and that she herself also was the leader of
   other virgins.
     __________________________________________________________________

   55. So after certain days he went in again to the mountain. And
   henceforth many resorted to him, and others who were suffering ventured
   to go in. To all the monks therefore who came to him, he continually
   gave this precept: Believe on the Lord and love Him; keep yourselves
   from filthy thoughts and fleshly pleasures, and as it is written in the
   Proverbs, be not deceived "by the fulness of the belly [1098] ." Pray
   continually; avoid vainglory; sing psalms before sleep and on awaking;
   hold in your heart the commandments of Scripture; be mindful of the
   works of the saints that your souls being put in remembrance of the
   commandments may be brought into harmony with the zeal of the saints.'
   And especially he counselled them to meditate continually on the
   apostle's word, Let not the sun go down upon your wrath [1099] .' And
   he considered this was spoken of all commandments in common, and that
   not on wrath alone, but not on any other sin of ours, ought the sun to
   go down. For it was good and needful that neither the sun should
   condemn us for an evil by day nor the moon for a sin by night, or even
   for an evil thought. That this state may be preserved in us it is good
   to hear the apostle and keep his words, for he says, Try your own
   selves and prove your own selves [1100] .' Daily, therefore, let each
   one take from himself the tale of his actions both by day and night;
   and if he have sinned, let him cease from it; while if he have not, let
   him not be boastful. But let him abide in that which is good, without
   being negligent, nor condemning his neighbours, nor justifying himself,
   until the Lord come who searcheth out hidden things [1101] ,' as saith
   the blessed apostle Paul. For often unawares we do things that we know
   not of; but the Lord seeth all things. Wherefore committing the
   judgment to Him, let us have sympathy one with another. Let us bear
   each other's burdens [1102] : but let us examine our own selves and
   hasten to fill up that in which we are lacking. And as a safeguard
   against sin let the following be observed. Let us each one note and
   write down our actions and the impulses of our soul as though we were
   going to relate them to each other. And be assured that if we should be
   utterly ashamed to have them known, we shall abstain from sin and
   harbour no base thoughts in our mind. For who wishes to be seen while
   sinning? or who will not rather lie after the commission of a sin,
   through the wish to escape notice? As then while we are looking at one
   another, we would not commit carnal sin, so if we record our thoughts
   as though about to tell them to one another, we shall the more easily
   keep ourselves free from vile thoughts through shame lest they should
   be known. Wherefore let that which is written be to us in place of the
   eyes of our fellow hermits, that blushing as much to write as if we had
   been caught, we may never think of what is unseemly. Thus fashioning
   ourselves we shall be able to keep the body in subjection, to please
   the Lord, and to trample on the devices of the enemy.

   56. This was the advice he gave to those who came to him. And with
   those who suffered he sympathised and prayed. And oft-times the Lord
   heard him on behalf of many: yet he boasted not because he was heard,
   nor did he murmur if he were not. But always he gave the Lord thanks
   and besought the sufferer to be patient, and to know that healing
   belonged neither to him nor to man at all, but only to the Lord, who
   doeth good when and to whom He will. The sufferers therefore used to
   receive the words of the old man as though they were a cure, learning
   not to be downhearted but rather to be long-suffering. And those who
   were healed were taught not to give thanks to Antony but to God alone.

   57. Wherefore a man, Fronto by name, who was an officer of the Court
   and had a terrible disease, for he used to bite his own tongue and was
   in danger of injury to his eyes, having come to the mountain, asked
   Antony to pray for him. But Antony said to him, Depart and thou shalt
   be healed.' But when he was violent and remained within some days,
   Antony waited and said, If thou stayest here, thou canst not be healed.
   Go, and having come into Egypt thou shalt see the sign wrought in
   thee.' And he believed and went. And as soon as he set eyes on Egypt
   his sufferings ceased, and the man became whole according to the word
   of Antony, which the Saviour had revealed to him in prayer.

   58. There was also a maiden from Busiris Tripolitana, who had a
   terrible and very hideous disorder. For the runnings of her eyes, nose,
   and ears fell to the ground and immediately became worms. She was
   paralysed also and squinted. Her parents having heard of monks going to
   Antony, and believing on the Lord who healed [1103] the woman with the
   issue of blood, asked to be allowed, together with their daughter, to
   journey with them. And when they suffered them, the parents together
   with the girl, remained outside the mountain with Paphnutius, the
   confessor and monk; but the monks went in to Antony. And when they only
   wished to tell about the damsel, he anticipated them, and detailed both
   the sufferings of the child and how she journeyed with them. Then when
   they asked that she should be admitted, Antony did not allow it, but
   said, Go, and if she be not dead, you will find her healed: for the
   accomplishment of this is not mine, that she should come to me,
   wretched man that I am, but her healing is the work of the Saviour, who
   in every place sheweth His pity to them that call upon Him. Wherefore
   the Lord hath inclined to her as she prayed, and His loving-kindness
   hath declared to me that He will heal the child where she now is.' So
   the wonder took place; and going out they found the parents rejoicing
   and the girl whole.

   59. But when two brethren were coming to him, the water failed on the
   way, and one died and the other was at the point of death, for he had
   no strength to go on, but lay upon the ground expecting to die. But
   Antony sitting in the mountain called two monks, who chanced to be
   there, and urged them saying, Take a pitcher of water and run on the
   road towards Egypt. For of two men who were coming, one is already dead
   and the other will die unless you hasten. For this has been revealed to
   me as I was praying.' The monks therefore went, and found one lying
   dead, whom they buried, and the other they restored with water and led
   him to the old man. For it was a day's journey [1104] . But if any one
   asks, why he did not speak before the other died, the question ought
   not to be asked. For the punishment of death was not Antony's but
   God's, who also judged the one and revealed the condition of the other.
   But the marvel here was only in the case of Antony: that he sitting in
   the mountain had his heart watchful, and had the Lord to show him
   things afar off.

   60. And this is so, for once again he was sitting on the mountain, and
   looking up saw in the air some one being borne upwards, and there was
   much joy among those who met him. Then wondering and deeming a company
   of that kind to be blessed, he prayed to learn what this might be. And
   immediately a voice came to him: This is the soul of Amun, the monk at
   Nitria.' Now Amun had persevered in the discipline up to old age; and
   the distance from Nitria to the mountain where Antony was, was thirteen
   days' journey. The companions of Antony therefore, seeing the old man
   amazed, asked to learn, and heard that Amun was just dead [1105] . And
   he was well known, for he had stayed there very often, and many signs
   had been wrought by his means. And this is one of them. Once when he
   had need to cross the river called Lycus (now it was the season of the
   flood), he asked his comrade Theodorus to remain at a distance, that
   they should not see one another naked as they swam the water. Then when
   Theodorus was departed he again felt ashamed even to see himself naked.
   While, therefore, he was pondering filled with shame, on a sudden he
   was borne over to the other side. Theodorus, therefore, himself being a
   good man, approached, and seeing Amun across first without a drop of
   water falling from him, enquired how he had got over. And when he saw
   that Amun was unwilling to tell him, he held him by the feet and
   declared that he would not let him go before he had learned it from
   him. So Amun seeing the determination of Theodorus especially from what
   he had said, and having asked him to tell no man before his death, told
   him that he had been carried and placed on the further side. And that
   he had not even set foot on the water, nor was that possible for man,
   but for the Lord alone and those whom He permits, as He did for the
   great apostle Peter [1106] . Theodorus therefore told this after the
   death of Amun. And the monks to whom Antony spoke concerning Amun's
   death marked the day; and when the brethren came up from Nitria thirty
   days after, they enquired of them and learned that Amun had fallen
   asleep at that day and hour in which the old man had seen his soul
   borne upwards. And both these and the others marvelled at the purity of
   Antony's soul, how he had immediately learned that which was taking
   place at a distance of thirteen days' journey, and had seen the soul as
   it was taken up.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1105] The same story is told (by Bede in his Life) of St. Cuthbert,
   who saw the soul of St. Aidan being carried to heaven. Amun was
   probably the recipient of the letter, No. 48 in this volume.

   [1106] Matt. xiv. 28.
     __________________________________________________________________

   61. And Archelaus too, the Count, on a time having found him in the
   outer mountain, asked him merely to pray for Polycratia of Laodicea, an
   excellent and Christian [1107] maiden, for she suffered terribly in the
   stomach and side through over much discipline, and was altogether
   weakly of body. Antony prayed therefore, and the Count noted the day in
   which the prayer was made, and having departed to Laodicea he found the
   maiden whole. And having enquired when and on what day she was relieved
   of her infirmity, he produced the paper on which he had written the
   time of the prayer, and having read it he immediately shewed the
   writing on the paper. And all wondered when they knew that the Lord had
   relieved her of pain at the time when Antony was praying and invoking
   the goodness of the Saviour on her behalf.

   62. And concerning those who came to him, he often foretold some days
   or sometimes a month beforehand what was the cause of their coming. For
   some came only for the sake of seeing him, others through sickness, and
   others suffering from evil spirits. And all thought the labour of the
   journey neither trouble nor loss. For each one returned aware that he
   had received benefit. But though saying such things and beholding such
   sights, he used to ask that no one should wonder at him for this; but
   should rather marvel at the Lord for having granted to us men to know
   Him as far as our powers extended.

   63. Afterwards, on another occasion, having descended to the outer
   cells, he was asked to enter a vessel and pray with the monks, and he
   alone perceived an exceedingly unpleasant smell. But those on board
   said that the stench arose from the fish and salt meat in the ship. He
   replied however, the smell was different from that; and while he was
   speaking, a youth with an evil spirit, who had come and hidden himself
   in the ship, cried out. But the demon being rebuked in the name of the
   Lord Jesus Christ departed from him, and the man became whole. And all
   knew that the evil smell arose from the demon.

   64. And another, a person of rank, came to him, possessed by a demon;
   and the demon was so terrible that the man possessed did not know that
   he was coming to Antony. But he even ate the excreta from his body. So
   those who brought him besought Antony to pray for him. And Antony
   pitying the young man prayed and kept watch with him all the night. And
   about dawn the young man suddenly attacked Antony and gave him a push.
   But when those who came with him were angry, Antony said, Be not angry
   with the young man, for it is not he, but the demon which is in him.
   And being rebuked and commanded to go into dry places, the demon became
   raging mad, and he has done this. Wherefore give thanks to the Lord,
   for his attack on me thus is a sign of the departure of the evil
   spirit.' When Antony had said this, straightway the young man had
   become whole, and having come at last to his right mind, knew where he
   was, and saluted the old man and gave thanks to God.

   65. And many monks have related with the greatest agreement and
   unanimity that many other such like things were done by him. But still
   these do not seem as marvellous as certain other things appear to be.
   For once, when about to eat, having risen up to pray about the ninth
   hour, he perceived that he was caught up in the spirit, and, wonderful
   to tell, he stood and saw himself, as it were, from outside himself,
   and that he was led in the air by certain ones. Next certain bitter and
   terrible beings stood in the air and wished to hinder him from passing
   through. But when his conductors opposed them, they demanded whether he
   was not accountable to them. And when they wished to sum up the account
   from his birth, Antony's conductors stopped them, saying, The Lord hath
   wiped out the sins from his birth, but from the time he became a monk,
   and devoted himself to God, it is permitted you to make a reckoning.'
   Then when they accused him and could not convict him, his way was free
   and unhindered. And immediately he saw himself, as it were, coming and
   standing by himself, and again he was Antony as before. Then forgetful
   of eating, he remained the rest of the day and through the whole of the
   night groaning and praying. For he was astonished when he saw against
   what mighty opponents our wrestling is, and by what labours we have to
   pass through the air. And he remembered that this is what the Apostle
   said, according to the prince of the power of the air [1108] .' For in
   it the enemy hath power to fight and to attempt to hinder those who
   pass through. Wherefore most earnestly he exhorted, Take up the whole
   armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day [1109]
   ,' that the enemy, having no evil thing to say against us, may be
   ashamed [1110] .' And we who have learned this, let us be mindful of
   the Apostle when he says, whether in the body I know not, or whether
   out of the body I know not; God knoweth [1111] .' But Paul was caught
   up unto the third heaven, and having heard things unspeakable he came
   down; while Antony saw that he had come to the air, and contended until
   he was free.

   66. And he had also this favour granted him. For as he was sitting
   alone on the mountain, if ever he was in perplexity in his meditations,
   this was revealed to him by Providence in prayer. And the happy man, as
   it is written, was taught of God [1112] . After this, when he once had
   a discussion with certain men who had come to him concerning the state
   of the soul and of what nature its place will be after this life, the
   following night one from above called him, saying, Antony, rise, go out
   and look.' Having gone out therefore (for he knew whom he ought to
   obey) looking up, he beheld one standing and reaching to the clouds,
   tall, hideous, and fearful, and others ascending as though they were
   winged. And the figure stretched forth his hands, and some of those who
   were ascending were stayed by him, while others flew above, and having
   escaped heaven-ward, were borne aloft free from care. At such,
   therefore, the giant gnashed his teeth, but rejoiced over those who
   fell back. And forthwith a voice came to Antony, Understandest thou
   what thou seest?' And his understanding was opened, and he understood
   that it was the passing of souls, and that the tall being who stood was
   the enemy who envies the faithful. And those whom he caught and stopped
   from passing through are accountable to him, while those whom he was
   unable to hold as they passed upwards had not been subservient to him.
   So having seen this, and as it were being reminded, he struggled the
   more daily to advance towards those things which were before. And these
   visions he was unwilling to tell, but as he spent much time in prayer,
   and was amazed, when those who were with him pressed him with questions
   and forced him, he was compelled to speak, as a father who cannot
   withhold ought from his children. And he thought that as his conscience
   was clear, the account would be beneficial for them, that they might
   learn that discipline bore good fruit, and that visions were oftentimes
   the solace of their labours.

   67. Added to this he was tolerant in disposition and humble in spirit.
   For though he was such a man, he observed the rule of the Church most
   rigidly, and was willing that all the clergy should be honoured above
   himself [1113] . For he was not ashamed to bow his head to bishops and
   presbyters, and if ever a deacon came to him for help he discoursed
   with him on what was profitable, but gave place to him in prayer, not
   being ashamed to learn himself. For often he would ask questions, and
   desired to listen to those who were present, and if any one said
   anything that was useful he confessed that he was profited. And
   besides, his countenance had a great and wonderful grace. This gift
   also he had from the Saviour. For if he were present in a great company
   of monks, and any one who did not know him previously, wished to see
   him, immediately coming forward he passed by the rest, and hurried to
   Antony, as though attracted by his appearance. Yet neither in height
   nor breadth was he conspicuous above others, but in the serenity of his
   manner and the purity of his soul. For as his soul was free from
   disturbances, his outward appearance was calm; so from the joy of his
   soul he possessed a cheerful countenance, and from his bodily movements
   could be perceived the condition of his soul, as it is written, When
   the heart is merry the countenance is cheerful, but when it is
   sorrowful it is cast down [1114] .' Thus Jacob recognised the counsel
   Laban had in his heart, and said to his wives, The countenance of your
   father is not as it was yesterday and the day before [1115] .' Thus
   Samuel recognised David, for he had mirthful eyes, and teeth white as
   milk. Thus Antony was recognised, for he was never disturbed, for his
   soul was at peace; he was never downcast, for his mind was joyous.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1113] This was by no means universal among monks: Athan. argues to
   Dracontius (cc. 8, 9) against the monastic tendency to think little of
   the clergy. Here, he propounds the example of Antony for the imitation
   of the peregrini fratres.'

   68. And he was altogether wonderful in faith and religious, for he
   never held communion with the Meletian schismatics, knowing their
   wickedness and apostacy from the beginning; nor had he friendly
   dealings with the ManichÃ¦ans or any other heretics; or, if he had, only
   as far as advice that they should change to piety. For he thought and
   asserted that intercourse with these was harmful and destructive to the
   soul. In the same manner also he loathed the heresy of the Arians, and
   exhorted all neither to approach them nor to hold their erroneous
   belief. And once when certain Arian madmen came to him, when he had
   questioned them and learned their impiety, he drove them from the
   mountain, saying that their words were worse than the poison of
   serpents.
     __________________________________________________________________

   69. And once also the Arians having lyingly asserted that Antony's
   opinions were the same as theirs, he was displeased and wroth against
   them. Then being summoned by the bishops and all the brethren, he
   descended from the mountain, and having entered Alexandria [1116] , he
   denounced the Arians, saying that their heresy was the last of all and
   a forerunner of Antichrist. And he taught the people that the Son of
   God was not a created being, neither had He come into being from
   non-existence, but that He was the Eternal Word and Wisdom of the
   Essence of the Father. And therefore it was impious to say, there was a
   time when He was not,' for the Word was always co-existent with the
   Father. Wherefore have no fellowship with the most impious Arians. For
   there is no communion between light and darkness [1117] . For you are
   good Christians, but they, when they say that the Son of the Father,
   the Word of God, is a created being, differ in nought from the heathen,
   since they worship that which is created, rather than God the creator
   [1118] . But believe ye that the Creation itself is angry with them
   because they number the Creator, the Lord of all, by whom all things
   came into being, with those things which were originated.

   70. All the people, therefore, rejoiced when they heard the
   anti-Christian heresy anathematised by such a man. And all the people
   in the city ran together to see Antony; and the Greeks and those who
   are called their Priests, came into the church, saying, We ask to see
   the man of God,' for so they all called him. For in that place also the
   Lord cleansed many of demons, and healed those who were mad. And many
   Greeks asked that they might even but touch the old man, believing that
   they should be profited. Assuredly as many became Christians in those
   few days as one would have seen made in a year. Then when some thought
   that he was troubled by the crowds, and on this account turned them all
   away from him, he said, undisturbedly, that there were not more of them
   than of the demons with whom he wrestled in the mountain.

   71. But when he was departing, and we were setting him forth on his
   way, as we [1119] arrived at the gate a woman from behind cried out,
   Stay, thou man of God, my daughter is grievously vexed by a devil.
   Stay, I beseech thee, lest I too harm myself with running.' And the old
   man when he heard her, and was asked by us, willingly stayed. And when
   the woman drew near, the child was cast on the ground. But when Antony
   had prayed and called upon the name of Christ, the child was raised
   whole, for the unclean spirit was gone forth. And the mother blessed
   God, and all gave thanks. And Antony himself also rejoiced, departing
   to the mountain as though it were to his own home.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1119] This seems to imply Athanasius as the (real or ostensible)
   narrator.
     __________________________________________________________________

   72. And Antony also was exceeding prudent, and the wonder was that
   although he had not learned letters, he was a ready-witted and
   sagacious man. At all events two Greek philosophers once came, thinking
   they could try their skill on Antony; and he was in the outer mountain,
   and having recognised who they were from their appearance, he came to
   them and said to them by means of an interpreter, Why, philosophers,
   did ye trouble yourselves so much to come to a foolish man?' And when
   they said that he was not a foolish man, but exceedingly prudent, he
   said to them, If you came to a foolish man, your labour is superfluous;
   but if you think me prudent become as I am, for we ought to imitate
   what is good. And if I had come to you I should have imitated you; but
   if you to me, become as I am, for I am a Christian.' But they departed
   with wonder, for they saw that even demons feared Antony.

   73. And again others such as these met him in the outer mountain and
   thought to mock [1120] him because he had not learned letters. And
   Antony said to them, What say ye? which is first, mind or letters? And
   which is the cause of which--mind of letters or letters of mind?' And
   when they answered mind is first and the inventor of letters, Antony
   said, Whoever, therefore, hath a sound mind hath not need of letters.'
   This answer amazed both the bystanders and the philosophers, and they
   departed marvelling that they had seen so much understanding in an
   ignorant man. For his manners were not rough as though he had been
   reared in the mountain and there grown old, but graceful and polite,
   and his speech was seasoned with the divine salt, so that no one was
   envious, but rather all rejoiced over him who visited him.

   74. After this again certain others came; and these were men who were
   deemed wise among the Greeks, and they asked him a reason for our faith
   in Christ. But when they attempted to dispute concerning the preaching
   of the divine Cross and meant to mock, Antony stopped for a little, and
   first pitying their ignorance, said, through an interpreter, who could
   skilfully interpret his words, Which is more beautiful, to confess the
   Cross or to attribute to those whom you call gods adultery and the
   seduction of boys? For that which is chosen by us is a sign of courage
   and a sure token of the contempt of death, while yours are the passions
   of licentiousness. Next, which is better, to say that the Word of God
   was not changed, but, being the same, He took a human body for the
   salvation and well-being of man, that having shared in human birth He
   might make man partake in the divine and spiritual nature [1121] ; or
   to liken the divine to senseless animals and consequently to worship
   four-footed beasts, creeping things and the likenesses of men? For
   these things, are the objects of reverence of you wise men. But how do
   you dare to mock us, who say that Christ has appeared as man, seeing
   that you, bringing the soul from heaven, assert that it has strayed and
   fallen from the vault of the sky into body [1122] ? And would that you
   had said that it had fallen into human body alone, and not asserted
   that it passes and changes into four-footed beasts and creeping things.
   For our faith declares that the coming of Christ was for the salvation
   of men. But you err because you speak of soul as not generated. And we,
   considering the power and loving-kindness of Providence, think that the
   coming of Christ in the flesh was not impossible with God. But you,
   although calling the soul the likeness of Mind [1123] , connect it with
   falls and feign in your myths that it is changeable, and consequently
   introduce the idea that Mind itself is changeable by reason of the
   soul. For whatever is the nature of a likeness, such necessarily is the
   nature of that of which it is a likeness. But whenever you think such a
   thought concerning Mind, remember that you blaspheme even the Father of
   Mind Himself [1124] .

   75. But concerning the Cross, which would you say to be the better, to
   bear it, when a plot is brought about by wicked men, nor to be in fear
   of death brought about under any form whatever [1125] ; or to prate
   about the wanderings of Osiris and Isis, the plots of Typhon, the
   flight of Cronos, his eating his children and the slaughter of his
   father. For this is your wisdom. But how, if you mock the Cross, do you
   not marvel at the resurrection? For the same men who told us of the
   latter wrote the former. Or why when you make mention of the Cross are
   you silent about the dead who were raised, the blind who received their
   sight, the paralytics who were healed, the lepers who were cleansed,
   the walking upon the sea, and the rest of the signs and wonders, which
   shew that Christ is no longer a man but God? To me you seem to do
   yourselves much injustice and not to have carefully read our
   Scriptures. But read and see that the deeds of Christ prove Him to be
   God come upon earth for the salvation of men.

   76. But do you tell us your religious beliefs. What can you say of
   senseless creatures except senselessness and ferocity? But if, as I
   hear, you wish to say that these things are spoken of by you as
   legends, and you allegorize the rape of the maiden Persephone of the
   earth; the lameness of HephÃ¦stus of fire; and allegorize the air as
   Hera, the sun as Apollo, the moon as Artemis, and the sea as Poseidon;
   none the less, you do not worship God Himself, but serve the creature
   rather than God who created all things. For if because creation is
   beautiful you composed such legends, still it was fitting that you
   should stop short at admiration and not make gods of the things
   created; so that you should not give the honour of the Creator to that
   which is created. Since, if you do, it is time for you to divert the
   honour of the master builder to the house built by him; and of the
   general to the soldier. What then can you reply to these things, that
   we may know whether the Cross hath anything worthy of mockery?'

   77. But when they were at a loss, turning hither and thither, Antony
   smiled and said--again through an interpreter--Sight itself carries the
   conviction of these things. But as you prefer to lean upon
   demonstrative arguments, and as you, having this art, wish us also not
   to worship God, until after such proof, do you tell first how things in
   general and specially the recognition of God are accurately known. Is
   it through demonstrative argument or the working of faith? And which is
   better, faith which comes through the inworking (of God) or
   demonstration by arguments?' And when they answered that faith which
   comes through the inworking was better and was accurate knowledge,
   Antony said, You have answered well, for faith arises from disposition
   of soul, but dialectic from the skill of its inventors. Wherefore to
   those who have the inworking through faith, demonstrative argument is
   needless, or even superfluous. For what we know through faith this you
   attempt to prove through words, and often you are not even able to
   express what we understand. So the inworking through faith is better
   and stronger than your professional arguments.'

   78. We Christians therefore hold the mystery not in the wisdom of Greek
   arguments, but in the power of faith richly supplied to us by God
   through Jesus Christ. And to show that this statement is true, behold
   now, without having learned letters, we believe in God, knowing through
   His works His providence over all things. And to show that our faith is
   effective, so now we are supported by faith in Christ, but you by
   professional logomachies. The portents of the idols among you are being
   done away, but our faith is extending everywhere. You by your arguments
   and quibbles have converted none from Christianity to Paganism. We,
   teaching the faith on Christ, expose your superstition, since all
   recognise that Christ is God and the Son of God. You by your eloquence
   do not hinder the teaching of Christ. But we by the mention of Christ
   crucified put all demons to flight, whom you fear as if they were gods.
   Where the sign of the Cross is [1126] , magic is weak and witchcraft
   has no strength.

   79. Tell us therefore where your oracles are now? Where are the charms
   of the Egyptians? Where the delusions of the magicians? When did all
   these things cease and grow weak except when the Cross of Christ arose?
   Is It then a fit subject for mockery, and not rather the things brought
   to nought by it, and convicted of weakness? For this is a marvellous
   thing, that your religion was never persecuted, but even was honoured
   by men in every city, while the followers of Christ are persecuted, and
   still our side flourishes and multiplies over yours. What is yours,
   though praised and honoured, perishes, while the faith and teaching of
   Christ, though mocked by you and often persecuted by kings, has filled
   the world. For when has the knowledge of God so shone forth? or when
   has self-control and the excellence of virginity appeared as now? or
   when has death been so despised except when the Cross of Christ has
   appeared? And this no one doubts when he sees [1127] the martyr
   despising death for the sake of Christ, when he sees for Christ's sake
   the virgins of the Church keeping themselves pure and undefiled.

   Philo. Vit. Mos. iii. 13).

   [1124] It is certainly startling to find Antony, ignorant of Greek and
   of letters, reasoning with philosophers upon the doctrines of
   Neoplatonism. His whole life, excepting two short visits to Alexandria,
   had been spent out of ear-shot of such discussions. Yet it is not easy
   to say exactly how much a man of strong mind and retentive memory may
   have picked up from the conversation of those who visited him upon
   subjects so widely discussed as these speculations were.

   80. And these signs are sufficient to prove that the faith of Christ
   alone is the true religion. But see! you still do not believe and are
   seeking for arguments. We however make our proof "not in the persuasive
   words of Greek wisdom [1128] " as our teacher has it, but we persuade
   by the faith which manifestly precedes argumentative proof. Behold
   there are here some vexed with demons;'--now there were certain who had
   come to him very disquieted by demons, and bringing them into the midst
   he said,--Do you cleanse them either by arguments and by whatever art
   or magic you choose, calling upon your idols, or if you are unable, put
   away your strife with us and you shall see the power of the Cross of
   Christ.' And having said this he called upon Christ, and signed the
   sufferers two or three times with the sign of the Cross. And
   immediately the men stood up whole, and in their right mind, and
   forthwith gave thanks unto the Lord. And the philosophers, as they are
   called, wondered, and were astonished exceedingly at the understanding
   of the man and at the sign which had been wrought. But Antony said, Why
   marvel ye at this? We are not the doers of these things, but it is
   Christ who worketh them by means of those who believe on Him. Believe,
   therefore, also yourselves, and you shall see that with us there is no
   trick of words, but faith through love which is wrought in us towards
   Christ; which if you yourselves should obtain you will no longer seek
   demonstrative arguments, but will consider faith in Christ sufficient.'
   These are the words of Antony. And they marvelling at this also,
   saluted him and departed, confessing the benefit they had received from
   him [1129] .
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1128] 1 Cor. ii. 4.

   [1129] The above argument with the philosophers runs upon the general
   lines of that of Athanasius c. Gent. The point which we miss here is
   the Euhemerism upon which Athanasius so strongly insists. This latter
   view would be naturally less congenial to Antony's mind than the view
   that the gods were merely demons.
     __________________________________________________________________

   81. And the fame of Antony came even unto kings. For Constantine
   Augustus, and his sons Constantius and Constans the Augusti wrote
   letters to him, as to a father, and begged an answer from him. But he
   made nothing very much of the letters, nor did he rejoice at the
   messages, but was the same as he had been before the Emperors wrote to
   him. But when they brought him the letters he called the monks and
   said, Do not be astonished if an emperor writes to us, for he is a man;
   but rather wonder that God wrote the Law for men and has spoken to us
   [1130] through His own Son.' And so he was unwilling to receive the
   letters, saying that he did not know how to write an answer to such
   things. But being urged by the monks because the emperors were
   Christians, and lest they should take offence on the ground that they
   had been spurned, he consented that they should be read, and wrote an
   answer approving them because they worshipped Christ, and giving them
   counsel on things pertaining to salvation: not to think much of the
   present, but rather to remember the judgment that is coming, and to
   know that Christ alone was the true and Eternal King.' He begged them
   to be merciful and to give heed to justice and the poor. And they
   having received the answer rejoiced. Thus he was dear to all, and all
   desired to consider him as a father.

   82. Being known to be so great a man, therefore, and having thus given
   answers to those who visited him, he returned again to the inner
   mountain, and maintained his wonted discipline. And often when people
   came to him, as he was sitting or walking, as it is written in Daniel
   [1131] , he became dumb, and after a season he resumed the thread of
   what he had been saying before to the brethren who were with him. And
   his companions perceived that he was seeing a vision. For often when he
   was on the mountains he saw what was happening in Egypt, and told it to
   Serapion the bishop [1132] , who was indoors with him, and who saw that
   Antony was wrapped in a vision. Once as he was sitting and working, he
   fell, as it were, into a trance, and groaned much at what he saw. Then
   after a time, having turned to the bystanders with groans and
   trembling, he prayed, and falling on his knees remained so a long time.
   And having arisen the old man wept. His companions, therefore,
   trembling and terrified, desired to learn from him what it was. And
   they troubled him much, until he was forced to speak. And with many
   groans he spake as follows: O, my children, it were better to die
   before what has appeared in the vision come to pass.' And when again
   they asked him, having burst into tears, he said, Wrath is about to
   seize the Church, and it is on the point of being given up to men who
   are like senseless beasts. For I saw the table of the Lord's House, and
   mules standing around it on all sides in a ring, and kicking the things
   therein, just like a herd kicks when it leaps in confusion. And you
   saw,' said he, how I groaned, for I heard a voice saying, "My altar
   shall be defiled."' These things the old man saw, and after two years
   the present [1133] inroad of the Arians and the plunder of the churches
   took place, when they violently carried off the vessels, and made the
   heathen carry them; and when they forced the heathen from the prisons
   to join in their services, and in their presence did upon the Table as
   they would. Then we all understood that these kicks of the mules
   signified to Antony what the Arians, senselessly like beasts, are now
   doing. But when he saw this vision, he comforted those with him,
   saying, Be not downcast, my children; for as the Lord has been angry,
   so again will He heal us, and the Church shall soon again receive her
   own order, and shall shine forth as she is wont. And you shall behold
   the persecuted restored, and wickedness again withdrawn to its own
   hiding-place, and pious faith speaking boldly in every place with all
   freedom. Only defile [1134] not yourselves with the Arians, for their
   teaching is not that of the Apostles, but that of demons and their
   father the devil; yea, rather, it is barren and senseless, and without
   light understanding, like the senselessness of these mules.'

   two years of the troubles in question. The Benedictines refer the
   troubles to the intrusion of Gregory in 341' (really 339), and the
   apparently unprecedented character ascribed to the outrages by Antony
   is in favour of this, as well as the fact (Encyc. 3) that in 339 the
   heathen are said to have offered sacrifice in the churches. But the
   latter is only in superficial agreement with the Greek text of the
   present passage, which speaks of Arian sunaxeis at which heathen were
   impressed to be present, apparently to make some show of a
   congregation. The Evagrian version, indeed, adds that the Gentiles on
   this occasion also carried on idolatrous rites in the Church and
   polluted the baptisteries; but Evagrius is in the habit of
   interpolating little details from his own knowledge or opinion (e.g.
   16, Ita exorsus,' &c., 26, qui vinctas hominum linguas solvebat,' 58,
   qui effosso pro Christo oculo sub Maximiano,' &c.), and in this case
   appears to borrow from Encycl. 3. Again, the writer of the Vita was not
   present (the bystanders' supra; they troubled him;' they asked
   him;'...and infr. those with him') when the Vision took place: but
   when, two years later, it was interpreted by events, he was in the
   company of those who had been with Antony at the time (infr. then we
   all understood'). This (on the assumption of Athanasian authorship)
   excludes the year 339, when Athanasius fled to Italy, and compels us to
   refer the Vision to the troubles of 356 (Apol. Fug. 6, 7. Hist. Ar. 55,
   56, Ep. ad Lucif.), after which Athanasius fled to the desert and was
   in the company of the monks. This conclusion is in independent
   agreement with (1) the fact, decisive by itself, that Antony is still
   alive in 345, when Nestorius became Prefect of Egypt (Â§86, note 3),
   i.e. six years after the troubles of 339; (2) the evidence that Antony
   was still living about 353 a.d. (Epist. Ammon. de Pachom. et Theod. 20,
   21, in Act. SS. Mai. tom. iii. Appendix 70 C E, Tillemont vii. 123),
   and (3) the statement of Jerome (Chron.) that Antony died in 356.
   Against it Weingarten urges the prophecy of restored peace to the
   Church (infr.) as pointing to a time after the overthrow of Arianism.
   This is of little weight, for the prophecy expresses only what must
   have been the hope and belief of all. The prologue, which Tillemont
   (viii. 227) thinks must have been written in a time of peace at
   Alexandria, is not sufficiently explicit on the point to weigh against
   the plain sense of the present passage.

   83. Such are the words of Antony, and we ought not to doubt whether
   such marvels were wrought by the hand of a man. For it is the promise
   of the Saviour, when He saith, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard
   seed, ye shall say to this mountain, remove hence and it shall remove;
   and nothing shall be impossible unto you [1135] .' And again, Verily,
   verily, I say unto you, if ye shall ask the father in My name He will
   give it you. Ask and ye shall receive [1136] .' And He himself it is
   who saith to His disciples and to all who believe on Him, Heal the
   sick, cast out demons; freely ye have received, freely give [1137] .'

   84. Antony, at any rate, healed not by commanding, but by prayer and
   speaking the name of Christ. So that it was clear to all that it was
   not he himself who worked, but the Lord who showed mercy by his means
   and healed the sufferers. But Antony's part was only prayer and
   discipline, for the sake of which he stayed in the mountain, rejoicing
   in the contemplation of divine things, but grieving when troubled by
   much people, and dragged to the outer mountain. For all judges used to
   ask him to come down, because it was impossible for them to enter on
   account of their following of litigants. But nevertheless they asked
   him to come that they might but see him. When therefore he avoided it
   and refused to go to them, they remained firm, and sent to him all the
   more the prisoners under charge of soldiers, that on account of these
   he might come down. Being forced by necessity, and seeing them
   lamenting, he came into the outer mountain, and again his labour was
   not unprofitable. For his coming was advantageous and serviceable to
   many; and he was of profit to the judges, counselling them to prefer
   justice to all things; to fear God, and to know, that with what
   judgment they judged, they should be judged [1138] .' But he loved more
   than all things his sojourn in the mountain.

   85. At another time, suffering the same compulsion at the hands of them
   who had need, and after many entreaties from the commander of the
   soldiers, he came down, and when he was come he spoke to them shortly
   of the things which make for salvation, and concerning those who wanted
   him, and was hastening away. But when the duke, as he is called,
   entreated him to stay, he replied that he could not linger among them,
   and persuaded him by a pretty simile, saying, Fishes, if they remain
   long on dry land, die. And so monks lose their strength if they loiter
   among you and spend their time with you. Wherefore as fish must hurry
   to the sea, so must we hasten to the mountain. Lest haply if we delay
   we forget the things within us.' And the general having heard this and
   many other things from him, was amazed and said, Of a truth this man is
   the servant of God. For, unless he were beloved of God, whence could an
   ignorant man have such great understanding?'
     __________________________________________________________________

   86. And a certain general, Balacius by name, persecuted us Christians
   bitterly on account of his regard for the Arians--that name of
   ill-omen. And as his ruthlessness was so great that he beat virgins,
   and stripped and scourged monks, Antony at this time wrote a letter as
   follows, and sent it to him. I see wrath coming upon thee, wherefore
   cease to persecute the Christians, lest haply wrath catch hold of thee,
   for even now it is on the point of coming upon thee [1139] .' But
   Balacius laughed and threw the letter on the ground, and spit on it,
   and insulted the bearers, bidding them tell this to Antony: Since thou
   takest thought for the monks, soon I will come after thee also.' And
   five days had not passed before wrath came upon him. For Balacius and
   Nestorius, the Prefect of Egypt [1140] , went forth to the first
   halting-place from Alexandria, which is called ChÃ¦reu, and both were on
   horseback, and the horses belonged to Balacius, and were the quietest
   of all his stable. But they had not gone far towards the place when the
   horses began to frisk with one another as they are wont to do; and
   suddenly the quieter, on which Nestorius sat [1141] , with a bite
   dismounted Balacius, and attacked him, and tore his thigh so badly with
   its teeth that he was borne straight back to the city, and in three
   days died. And all wondered because what Antony had foretold had been
   so speedily fulfilled.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1139] In Hist. Ar. 14 the letter is sent not to Balacius but to
   Gregory, who died on June 26, 345 (Gwatkin, p. 105).

   [1140] Nestorius was prefect 345-352' (Index to Fest. Letters, where
   the year 345' is from August 344 to August 345).

   [1141] In the Hist. Ar. it is simply stated that Balacius was bitten by
   his own horse. The present passage looks like a more careful
   restatement.
     __________________________________________________________________

   87. Thus, therefore, he warned the cruel. But the rest who came to him
   he so instructed that they straightway forgot their lawsuits, and
   felicitated those who were in retirement from the world. And he
   championed those who were wronged in such a way that you would imagine
   that he, and not the others, was the sufferer. Further, he was able to
   be of such use to all, that many soldiers and men who had great
   possessions laid aside the burdens of life, and became monks for the
   rest of their days. And it was as if a physician had been given by God
   to Egypt. For who in grief met Antony and did not return rejoicing? Who
   came mourning for his dead and did not forthwith put off his sorrow?
   Who came in anger and was not converted to friendship? What poor and
   low-spirited man met him who, hearing him and looking upon him, did not
   despise wealth and console himself in his poverty? What monk, having
   being neglectful, came to him and became not all the stronger? What
   young man having come to the mountain and seen Antony, did not
   forthwith deny himself pleasure and love temperance? Who when tempted
   by a demon, came to him and did not find rest? And who came troubled
   with doubts and did not get quietness of mind?
     __________________________________________________________________

   88. For this was the wonderful thing in Antony's discipline, that, as I
   said before, having the gift of discerning spirits, he recognised their
   movements, and was not ignorant whither any one of them turned his
   energy and made his attack. And not only was he not deceived by them
   himself, but cheering those who were troubled with doubts, he taught
   them how to defeat their plans, telling them of the weakness and craft
   of those who possessed them. Thus each one, as though prepared by him
   for battle, came down from the mountain, braving the designs of the
   devil and his demons. How many maidens who had suitors, having but seen
   Antony from afar, remained maidens for Christ's sake. And people came
   also from foreign parts to him, and like all others, having got some
   benefit, returned, as though set forward by a father. And certainly
   when he died, all as having been bereft of a father, consoled
   themselves solely by their remembrances of him, preserving at the same
   time his counsel and advice.
     __________________________________________________________________

   89. It is worth while that I should relate, and that you, as you wish
   it, should hear what his death was like. For this end of his is worthy
   of imitation. According to his custom he visited the monks in the outer
   mountain, and having learned from Providence that his own end was at
   hand, he said to the brethren, This is my last visit to you which I
   shall make. And I shall be surprised if we see each other again in this
   life. At length the time of my departure is at hand, for I am near a
   hundred and five years old.' And when they heard it they wept, and
   embraced, and kissed the old man. But he, as though sailing from a
   foreign city to his own, spoke joyously, and exhorted them Not to grow
   idle in their labours, nor to become faint in their training, but to
   live as though dying daily. And as he had said before, zealously to
   guard the soul from foul thoughts, eagerly to imitate the Saints, and
   to have nought to do with the Meletian schismatics, for you know their
   wicked and profane character. Nor have any fellowship with the Arians,
   for their impiety is clear to all. Nor be disturbed if you see the
   judges protect them, for it shall cease, and their pomp is mortal and
   of short duration. Wherefore keep yourselves all the more untainted by
   them, and observe the traditions of the fathers, and chiefly the holy
   faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, which you have learned from the
   Scripture, and of which you have often been put in mind by me.'

   90. But when the brethren were urging him to abide with them and there
   to die, he suffered it not for many other reasons, as he showed by
   keeping silence, and especially for this:--The Egyptians are wont to
   honour with funeral rites, and to wrap in linen cloths at death the
   bodies of good men, and especially of the holy martyrs; and not to bury
   them underground, but to place them on couches, and to keep them in
   their houses, thinking in this to honour the departed. And Antony often
   urged the bishops to give commandment to the people on this matter. In
   like manner he taught the laity and reproved the women, saying, that
   this thing was neither lawful nor holy at all. For the bodies of the
   patriarchs and prophets are until now preserved in tombs, and the very
   body of the Lord was laid in a tomb, and a stone was laid upon it, and
   hid it until He rose on the third day [1142] .' And thus saying, he
   showed that he who did not bury the bodies of the dead after death
   transgressed the law, even though they were sacred. For what is greater
   or more sacred than the body of the Lord? Many therefore having heard,
   henceforth buried the dead underground, and gave thanks to the Lord
   that they had been taught rightly.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1142] Cf. John xix. 41; Matt. xxvii. 60.
     __________________________________________________________________

   91. But he, knowing the custom, and fearing that his body would be
   treated this way, hastened, and having bidden farewell to the monks in
   the outer mountain entered the inner mountain, where he was accustomed
   to abide. And after a few months he fell sick. Having summoned those
   who were there--they were two in number who had remained in the
   mountain fifteen years, practising the discipline and attending on
   Antony on account of his age--he said to them, I, as it is written
   [1143] , go the way of the fathers, for I perceive that I am called by
   the Lord. And do you be watchful and destroy not your long discipline,
   but as though now making a beginning, zealously preserve your
   determination. For ye know the treachery of the demons, how fierce they
   are, but how little power they have. Wherefore fear them not, but
   rather ever breathe Christ, and trust Him. Live as though dying daily.
   Give heed to yourselves, and remember the admonition you have heard
   from me. Have no fellowship with the schismatics, nor any dealings at
   all with the heretical Arians. For you know how I shunned them on
   account of their hostility to Christ, and the strange doctrines of
   their heresy. Therefore be the more earnest always to be followers
   first of God and then of the Saints; that after death they also may
   receive you as well-known friends into the eternal habitations. Ponder
   over these things and think of them, and if you have any care for me
   and are mindful of me as of a father, suffer no one to take my body
   into Egypt, lest haply they place me in the houses [1144] , for to
   avoid this I entered into the mountain and came here. Moreover you know
   how I always put to rebuke those who had this custom, and exhorted them
   to cease from it. Bury my body, therefore, and hide it underground
   yourselves, and let my words be observed by you that no one may know
   the place [1145] but you alone. For at the resurrection of the dead I
   shall receive it incorruptible from the Saviour. And divide my
   garments. To Athanasius the bishop give one sheepskin and the garment
   whereon I am laid, which he himself gave me new, but which with me has
   grown old. To Serapion the bishop give the other sheepskin, and keep
   the hair garment yourselves [1146] . For the rest fare ye well, my
   children, for Antony is departing, and is with you no more.'

   [1144] Cf. St. Aug. Serm. 361. 12, D.C.A. p. 251.

   [1145] The body of Antony was discovered by a revelation' in 561, and
   translated to Alexandria. When the Saracens conquered Egypt it was
   transferred to Constantinople, and lastly in the tenth century was
   carried to Vienne by a French Seigneur. The first and last links of
   this history are naturally precarious. The translation to Alexandria is
   vouched for by Victor of Tunis (Chron.) who was in the neighbourhood at
   the time.

   [1146] Jerome, in his life of Paul of Thebes, relates that Antony
   received from Paul, and ever afterwards wore on festivals, his tunic of
   palm-leaves. If this legacy more glorious than the purple of a king'
   (Vit. Paul. c. 13) had any existence, it would certainly not have been
   forgotten by Antony in disposing of his worldly goods. The silence of
   the Life of Antony throws discredit on Jerome's whole account of Paul.
     __________________________________________________________________

   92. Having said this, when they had kissed him, he lifted up his feet,
   and as though he saw friends coming to him and was glad because of
   them--for as he lay his countenance appeared joyful--he died and was
   gathered to the fathers. And they afterward, according to his
   commandment, wrapped him up and buried him, hiding his body
   underground. And no one knows to this day where it was buried, save
   those two only. But each of those who received the sheepskin of the
   blessed Antony and the garment worn by him guards it as a precious
   treasure. For even to look on them is as it were to behold Antony; and
   he who is clothed in them seems with joy to bear his admonitions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   93. This is the end of Antony's life in the body and the above was the
   beginning of the discipline. Even if this account is small compared
   with his merit, still from this reflect how great Antony, the man of
   God, was. Who from his youth to so great an age preserved a uniform
   zeal for the discipline, and neither through old age was subdued by the
   desire of costly food, nor through the infirmity of his body changed
   the fashion of his clothing, nor washed even his feet with water, and
   yet remained entirely free from harm. For his eyes were undimmed and
   quite sound and he saw clearly; of his teeth he had not lost one, but
   they had become worn to the gums through the great age of the old man.
   He remained strong both in hands and feet; and while all men were using
   various foods, and washings and divers garments, he appeared more
   cheerful and of greater strength. And the fact that his fame has been
   blazoned everywhere; that all regard him with wonder, and that those
   who have never seen him long for him, is clear proof of his virtue and
   God's love of his soul. For not from writings, nor from worldly wisdom,
   nor through any art, was Antony renowned, but solely from his piety
   towards God. That this was the gift of God no one will deny. For from
   whence into Spain and into Gaul, how into Rome and Africa, was the man
   heard of who abode hidden in a mountain, unless it was God who maketh
   His own known everywhere, who also promised this to Antony at the
   beginning? For even if they work secretly, even if they wish to remain
   in obscurity, yet the Lord shows them as lamps to lighten all, that
   those who hear may thus know that the precepts of God are able to make
   men prosper and thus be zealous in the path of virtue.
     __________________________________________________________________

   94. Read these words, therefore, to the rest of the brethren that they
   may learn what the life of monks ought to be; and may believe that our
   Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ glorifies those who glorify Him: and
   leads those who serve Him unto the end, not only to the kingdom of
   heaven, but here also--even though they hide themselves and are
   desirous of withdrawing from the world--makes them illustrious and well
   known everywhere on account of their virtue and the help they render
   others. And if need be, read this among the heathen, that even in this
   way they may learn that our Lord Jesus Christ is not only God and the
   Son of God, but also that the Christians who truly serve Him and
   religiously believe on Him, prove, not only that the demons, whom the
   Greeks themselves think to be gods, are no gods, but also tread them
   under foot and put them to flight, as deceivers and corrupters of
   mankind, through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom be glory for ever and
   ever. Amen.

   Introduction to Ad Episcopos Ã†gypti Et LibyÃ¦ Epistola Encyclica.

   ------------------------

   Written A.D. 356.

   This letter was addressed by St. Athanasius to the bishops of his
   Province after his expulsion by Syrianus (Feb. 8, 356), and when the
   nomination of George the contractor to the Alexandrian See was already
   known (Â§7). But no details of the persecution of the orthodox in Egypt
   had reached Athanasius when he wrote, in fact he mentions it as only
   beginning (Â§5). This points to about the Easter of 356; see Prolegg.
   ch. ii. Â§8 (1). The tract thus opens the series of anti-Arian works
   composed during the third exile.' It has indeed been inferred (by
   Baronius and others) from Â§22 that the letter was written thirty-six
   years after the Nicene Synod, i.e. in 361. But it was certainly written
   before the arrival of George, and in the passage referred to it is the
   first condemnation of Arius by Alexander, and not the Council of NicÃ¦a,
   that is placed thirty-six years ago. The primary purpose of the letter
   is to warn the bishops against a formulary which was on the point of
   being circulated for their acceptance on pain of banishment (Â§5). The
   creed in question cannot now be identified,--but it was very possibly
   the Sirmian Creed of 351 (de Synod. 27), not formally Arian, but
   evading the Nicene test (Â§10). He begins, accordingly, after a general
   warning (1-4) against being imposed upon by mere words, and a statement
   (5) of the tactics of his opponents, by urging the bishops to hold to
   the faith of NicÃ¦a, in contrast to the shifting professions of its
   opponents (6-8), and to be satisfied with nothing short of an explicit
   repudiation of Arianism (9-11). In the Second Part of the Letter he
   turns to doctrine. He states (12) the original Arian position, and
   confronts it (13) with passages from Scripture. He challenges the
   Arians (14) to state any clear belief as to the nature of the Word,
   which shall reconcile their premises with the language of Holy Writ
   (15, 16). He explains Prov. viii. 22 of the Incarnation, and taxes the
   Arians with denying this truth, like the heathen (17). He next taxes
   them with dissimulation, especially Arius in his profession to
   Constantine (18); he describes the death of Arius, and presses the
   charge of complicity with a man already judged by God (19). He urges
   the bishops (20, 21) to steadfastness and confessorship, reprobates the
   coalition of Meletians (22) and Arians, and finally expresses the
   conviction (23) that the Emperor Constantius will put an end to these
   outrages when informed of the true facts of the case.

   The last section is an anticipation of the Apol. ad Constantium, which
   Athanasius was probably preparing at the same time. Not till two years
   later does he cast aside all hope of the Emperor and launch out in the
   bitter invective of the Arian History' (see Apol. pro Fuga 26, note 7).

   The place where this Encyclical was written is quite uncertain, but it
   was most probably in the Libyan desert, or in Cyrenaica (Prolegg. ubi
   supr. note 10). His language (infr. Â§5, note 7) would naturally be such
   as not to give, through so public a document, a clue to his pursuers.

   It may be added that in many mss., and in the editions previous to
   1698, this tract was counted as the first of the five' (or in some
   cases six') Orationes contra Arianos. For a discussion of this error,
   see Montfaucon's Monita to this tract and to the four Orationes.

   To the Bishops of Egypt.

   ------------------------

   Chapter I.

   1. Christ warned His followers against false prophets.

   All things whatsoever our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, as Luke wrote,
   both hath done and taught [1147] ,' He effected after having appeared
   for our salvation; for He came, as John saith, not to condemn the
   world, but that the world through Him might be saved [1148] .' And
   among the rest we have especially to admire this instance of His
   goodness, that He was not silent concerning those who should fight
   against us, but plainly told us beforehand, that, when those things
   should come to pass, we might straightway be found with minds
   established by His teaching. For He said, There shall arise false
   prophets and false Christs, and shall shew great signs and wonders;
   insomuch that, if it were possible, the very elect shall be deceived.
   Behold, I have told you before [1149] .' Manifold indeed and beyond
   human conception are the instructions and gifts of grace which He has
   laid up in us; as the pattern of heavenly conversation, power against
   demons, the adoption of sons, and that exceeding great and singular
   grace, the knowledge of the Father and of the Word Himself, and the
   gift of the Holy Ghost. But the mind of man is prone to evil
   exceedingly; moreover, our adversary the devil, envying us the
   possession of such great blessings, goeth about seeking to snatch away
   the seed of the word which is sown within us. Wherefore as if by His
   prophetic warnings He would seal up His instructions in our hearts as
   His own peculiar treasure, the Lord said, Take heed that no man deceive
   you: for many shall come in My name, saying, I am he; and the time
   draweth near; and they shall deceive many: go ye not therefore after
   them [1150] .' This is a great gift which the Word has bestowed upon
   us, that we should not be deceived by appearances, but that, howsoever
   these things are concealed, we should all the more distinguish them by
   the grace of the Spirit. For whereas the inventor of wickedness and
   great spirit of evil, the devil, is utterly hateful, and as soon as he
   shews himself is rejected [1151] of all men,--as a serpent, as a
   dragon, as a lion seeking whom he may seize upon and devour,--therefore
   he conceals and covers what he really is, and craftily personates that
   Name which all men desire, so that deceiving by a false appearance, he
   may thenceforth fix fast in his own chains those whom he has led
   astray. And as if one that desired to kidnap the children of others
   during the absence of their parents, should personate their appearance,
   and so putting a cheat on the affections of the offspring, should carry
   them far away and destroy them; in like manner this evil and wily
   spirit the devil, having no confidence in himself, and knowing the love
   which men bear to the truth, personates its appearance, and so spreads
   his own poison among those that follow after him.

   2. Satan pretending to be holy, is detected by the Christian.

   Thus he deceived Eve, not speaking his own, but artfully adopting the
   words of God, and perverting their meaning. Thus he suggested evil to
   the wife of Job, persuading her to feign affection for her husband,
   while he taught her to blaspheme God. Thus does the crafty spirit mock
   men by false displays, deluding and drawing each into his own pit of
   wickedness. When of old he deceived the first man Adam, thinking that
   through him he should have all men subject unto him, he exulted with
   great boldness and said, My hand hath found as a nest the riches of the
   people; and as one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all
   the earth; and there is none that shall escape me or speak against me
   [1152] .' But when the Lord came upon earth, and the enemy made trial
   of His human Economy, being unable to deceive the flesh which He had
   taken upon Him, from that time forth he, who promised himself the
   occupation of the whole world, is for His sake mocked even by children:
   that proud one is mocked as a sparrow [1153] . For now the infant child
   lays his hand upon the hole of the asp, and laughs at him that deceived
   Eve [1154] ; and all that rightly believe in the Lord tread under foot
   him that said, I will ascend above the heights of the clouds: I will be
   like the Most High [1155] .' Thus he suffers and is dishonoured; and
   although he still ventures with shameless confidence to disguise
   himself, yet now, wretched spirit, he is detected the rather by them
   that bear the Sign on their foreheads [1156] ; yea, more, he is
   rejected of them, and is humbled, and put to shame. For even if, now
   that he is a creeping serpent, he shall transform himself into an angel
   of light, yet his deception will not profit him; for we have been
   taught that though an angel from heaven preach unto us any other gospel
   than that we have received, he is anathema [1157] .'

   3. And although, again, he conceal his natural falsehood, and pretend
   to speak truth with his lips; yet are we not ignorant of his devices
   [1158] ,' but are able to answer him in the words spoken by the Spirit
   against him; But unto the ungodly, said God, why dost thou preach My
   laws?' and, Praise is not seemly in the mouth of a sinner [1159] .' For
   even though he speak the truth, the deceiver is not worthy of credit.
   And whereas Scripture shewed this, when relating his wicked artifices
   against Eve in Paradise, so the Lord also reproved him,--first in the
   mount, when He laid open the folds of his breast-plate [1160] ,' and
   shewed who the crafty spirit was, and proved that it was not one of the
   saints [1161] , but Satan that was tempting Him. For He said, Get thee
   behind Me Satan; for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy
   God, and Him only shalt thou serve [1162] .' And again, when He put a
   curb in the mouths of the demons that cried after Him from the tombs.
   For although what they said was true, and they lied not then, saying,
   Thou art the Son of God,' and the Holy One of God [1163] ;' yet He
   would not that the truth should proceed from an unclean mouth, and
   especially from such as them, lest under pretence thereof they should
   mingle with it their own malicious devices, and sow these also while
   men slept. Therefore He suffered them not to speak such words, neither
   would He have us to suffer such, but hath charged us by His own mouth,
   saying, Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheeps'
   clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves [1164] ;' and by the
   mouth of His Holy Apostles, Believe not every spirit [1165] .' Such is
   the method of our adversary's operations; and of the like nature are
   all these inventions of heresies, each of which has for the father of
   its own device the devil, who changed and became a murderer and a liar
   from the beginning. But being ashamed to profess his hateful name, they
   usurp the glorious Name of our Saviour which is above every name [1166]
   ,' and deck themselves out in the language of Scripture, speaking
   indeed the words, but stealing away the true meaning thereof; and so
   disguising by some artifice their false inventions, they also become
   the murderers of those whom they have led astray.

   4. It profits not to receive part of Scripture, and reject part.

   For whence do Marcion and ManichÃ¦us receive the Gospel while they
   reject the Law? For the New Testament arose out of the Old, and bears
   witness to the Old; if then they reject this, how can they receive what
   proceeds from it? Thus Paul was an Apostle of the Gospel, which God
   promised afore by His prophets in the holy Scriptures [1167] :' and our
   Lord Himself said, ye search the Scriptures, for they are they which
   testify of Me [1168] .' How then shall they confess the Lord unless
   they first search the Scriptures which are written concerning Him? And
   the disciples say that they have found Him, of whom Moses and the
   Prophets did write [1169] .' And what is the Law to the Sadducees if
   they receive not the Prophets [1170] ? For God who gave the Law,
   Himself promised in the Law that He would raise up Prophets also, so
   that the same is Lord both of the Law and of the Prophets, and he that
   denies the one must of necessity deny the other also. And again, what
   is the Old Testament to the Jews, unless they acknowledge the Lord
   whose coming was expected according to it? For had they believed the
   writings of Moses, they would have believed the words of the Lord; for
   He said, He wrote of Me [1171] .' Moreover, what are the Scriptures to
   him [1172] of Samosata, who denies the Word of God and His incarnate
   Presence [1173] , which is signified and declared both in the Old and
   New Testament? And of what use are the Scriptures to the Arians also,
   and why do they bring them forward, men who say that the Word of God is
   a creature, and like the Gentiles serve the creature more than' God the
   Creator [1174] ?' Thus each of these heresies, in respect of the
   peculiar impiety of its invention, has nothing in common with the
   Scriptures. And their advocates are aware of this, that the Scriptures
   are very much, or rather altogether, opposed to the doctrines of every
   one of them; but for the sake of deceiving the more simple sort (such
   as are those of whom it is written in the Proverbs, The simple
   believeth every word [1175] ),' they pretend like their father the
   devil [1176] ' to study and to quote the language of Scripture, in
   order that they may appear by their words to have a right belief, and
   so may persuade their wretched followers to believe what is contrary to
   the Scriptures. Assuredly in every one of these heresies the devil has
   thus disguised himself, and has suggested to them words full of
   craftiness. The Lord spake concerning them, that there shall arise
   false Christs and false prophets, so that they shall deceive many
   [1177] .' Accordingly the devil has come, speaking by each and saying,
   I am Christ, and the truth is with me;' and he has made them, one and
   all, to be liars like himself. And strange it is, that while all
   heresies are at variance with one another concerning the mischievous
   inventions which each has framed, they are united together only by the
   common purpose of lying [1178] . For they have one and the same father
   that has sown in them all the seeds, of falsehood. Wherefore the
   faithful Christian and true disciple of the Gospel, having grace to
   discern spiritual things, and having built the house of his faith upon
   a rock, stands continually firm and secure from their deceits. But the
   simple person, as I said before, that is not thoroughly grounded in
   knowledge, such an one, considering only the words that are spoken and
   not perceiving their meaning, is immediately drawn away by their wiles.
   Wherefore it is good and needful for us to pray that we may receive the
   gift of discerning spirits, so that every one may know, according to
   the precept of John, whom he ought to reject, and whom to receive as
   friends and of the same faith. Now one might write at great length
   concerning these things, if one desired to go into details respecting
   them; for the impiety and perverseness of heresies will appear to be
   manifold and various, and the craft of the deceivers to be very
   terrible. But since holy Scripture is of all things most sufficient
   [1179] for us, therefore recommending to those who desire to know more
   of these matters, to read the Divine word, I now hasten to set before
   you that which most claims attention, and for the sake of which
   principally I have written these things.

   5. Attempt of Arians to substitute a Creed for the Nicene.

   I heard during my sojourn in these parts [1180] (and they were true and
   orthodox brethren that informed me), that certain professors of Arian
   opinions had met together, and drawn a confession of faith to their own
   liking, and that they intend to send word to you, that you must either
   subscribe to what pleases them, or rather to what the devil has
   inspired them with, or in case of refusal must suffer banishment. They
   are indeed already beginning to molest the Bishops of these parts; and
   thereby are plainly manifesting their disposition. For inasmuch as they
   frame this document only for the purpose of inflicting banishment or
   other punishments, what does such conduct prove them to be, but enemies
   of the Christians, and friends of the devil and his angels? and
   especially since they spread abroad what they like contrary to the mind
   of that gracious Prince, our most religious Emperor Constantius [1181]
   . And this they do with great craftiness, and, as appears to me,
   chiefly with two ends in view; first, that by obtaining your
   subscriptions, they may seem to remove the evil repute that rests upon
   the name of Arius, and may escape notice themselves as if not
   professing his opinions; and again, that by putting forth these
   statements they may cast a shade over the Council of NicÃ¦a [1182] , and
   the confession of faith which was then put forth against the Arian
   heresy. But this proceeding does but prove the more plainly their own
   maliciousness and heterodoxy. For had they believed aright, they would
   have been satisfied with the confession put forth at NicÃ¦a by the whole
   Ecumenic Council; and had they considered themselves calumniated and
   falsely called Arians, they ought not to have been so eager to innovate
   upon what was written against Arius, lest what was directed against him
   might seem to be aimed at them also. This, however, is not the course
   they pursue, but they conduct the struggle in their own behalf, just as
   if they were Arius. Observe how entirely they disregard the truth, and
   how everything they say and do is for the sake of the Arian heresy. For
   in that they dare to question those sound definitions of the faith, and
   take upon themselves to produce others contrary to them, what else do
   they but accuse the Fathers, and stand up in defence of that heresy
   which they opposed and protested against? And what they now write
   proceeds not from any regard for the truth, as I said before, but
   rather they do it as in mockery and by an artifice, for the purpose of
   deceiving men; that by sending about their letters they may engage the
   ears of the people to listen to these notions, and so put off the time
   when they will be brought to trial; and that by concealing their
   impiety from observation, they may have room to extend their heresy,
   which, like a gangrene [1183] ,' eats its way everywhere.

   6. Accordingly they disturb and disorder everything, and yet not even
   thus are they satisfied with their own proceedings. For every year, as
   if they were going to draw up a contract, they meet together and
   pretend to write about the faith, whereby they expose themselves the
   more to ridicule and disgrace, because their expositions are rejected,
   not by others, but by themselves. For had they had any confidence in
   their previous statements, they would not have desired to draw up
   others; nor again, leaving these last, would they now have set down the
   one in question, which no doubt true to their custom they will again
   alter, after a very short interval, and as soon as they shall find a
   pretence for their customary plotting against certain persons. For when
   they have a design against any, then it is that they make a great show
   of writing about the faith; that, as Pilate washed his hands, so they
   by writing may destroy those who rightly believe in Christ, hoping
   that, as making definitions about the faith, they may appear, as I have
   repeatedly said, to be free from the charge of false doctrine. But they
   will not be able to hide themselves, nor to escape; for they
   continually become their own accusers even while they defend
   themselves. Justly so, since instead of answering those who bring proof
   against them, they do but persuade themselves to believe whatever they
   wish. And when is an acquittal obtained, upon the criminal becoming his
   own judge? Hence it is that they are always writing, and always
   altering their own previous statements, and thus they shew an uncertain
   faith [1184] ,' or rather a manifest unbelief and perverseness. And
   this, it appears to me, must needs be the case with them; for since,
   having fallen away from the truth, and desiring to overthrow that sound
   confession of faith which was drawn up at NicÃ¦a, they have, in the
   language of Scripture, loved to wander, and have not refrained their
   feet [1185] ;' therefore, like Jerusalem of old, they labour and toil
   in their changes, sometimes writing one thing, and sometimes another,
   but only for the sake of gaining time, and that they may continue
   enemies of Christ, and deceivers of mankind.

   7. The party of Acacius really Arians.

   Who, then, that has any real regard for truth, will be willing to
   suffer these men any longer? who will not justly reject their writing?
   who will not denounce their audacity, that being but few [1186] in
   number, they would have their decisions to prevail over everything, and
   as desiring the supremacy of their own meetings, held in corners and
   suspicious in their circumstances, would forcibly cancel the decrees of
   an uncorrupt, pure, and Ecumenic Council? Men who have been promoted by
   Eusebius and his fellows for advocating this Antichristian heresy,
   venture to define articles of faith, and while they ought to be brought
   to judgment as criminals, like Caiaphas, they take upon themselves to
   judge. They compose a Thalia, and would have it received as a standard
   of faith, while they are not yet themselves determined what they
   believe. Who does not know that Secundus [1187] of Pentapolis, who was
   several times degraded long ago, was received by them for the sake of
   the Arian madness; and that George [1188] , now of Laodicea, and
   Leontius the Eunuch, and before him Stephanus, and Theodorus of
   Heraclea [1189] , were promoted by them? Ursacius and Valens also, who
   from the first were instructed by Arius as young men [1190] , though
   they had been formerly degraded from the Priesthood, afterwards got the
   title of Bishops on account of their impiety; as did also Acacius,
   Patrophilus [1191] , and Narcissus, who have been most forward in all
   manner of impiety. These were degraded in the great Synod of Sardica;
   Eustathius also now of Sebastea, Demophilus and Germinius [1192] ,
   Eudoxius, and Basil, who are supporters of that impiety, were advanced
   in the same manner. Of Cecropius [1193] , and him they called
   Auxentius, and of Epictetus [1194] the impostor, it were superfluous
   for me to speak, since it is manifest to all men, in what manner, on
   what pretexts, and by what enemies of ours these were promoted, that
   they might bring their false charges against the orthodox Bishops who
   were the objects of their designs. For although they resided at the
   distance of eighty posts, and were unknown to the people, yet on the
   ground of their impiety they purchased for themselves the title of
   Bishop. For the same reason also they have now [1195] hired one George
   of Cappadocia, whom they wish to impose upon you. But no respect is due
   to him any more than to the rest; for there is a report in these parts
   that he is not even a Christian, but is devoted to the worship of
   idols; and he has a hangman's temper [1196] . And this person, such as
   he is described to be, they have taken into their ranks, that they may
   be able to injure, to plunder, and to slay; for in these things he is a
   great proficient, but is ignorant of the very principles of the
   Christian faith.

   8. Words are bad, though Scriptural, which proceed from bad men.

   Such are the machinations of these men against the truth: but their
   designs are manifest to all the world, though they attempt in ten
   thousand ways, like eels, to elude the grasp, and to escape detection
   as enemies of Christ. Wherefore I beseech you, let no one among you be
   deceived, no one seduced by them; rather, considering that a sort of
   judaical impiety is invading the Christian faith, be ye all zealous for
   the Lord; hold fast, every one, the faith we have received from the
   Fathers, which they who assembled at NicÃ¦a recorded in writing, and
   endure not those who endeavour to innovate thereon. And however they
   may write phrases out of the Scripture, endure not their writings;
   however they may speak the language of the orthodox, yet attend not to
   what they say; for they speak not with an upright mind, but putting on
   such language like sheeps' clothing, in their hearts they think with
   Arius, after the manner of the devil, who is the author of all
   heresies. For he too made use of the words of Scripture, but was put to
   silence by our Saviour. For if he had indeed meant them as he used
   them, he would not have fallen from heaven; but now having fallen
   through his pride, he artfully dissembles in his speech, and oftentimes
   maliciously endeavours to lead men astray by the subtleties and
   sophistries of the Gentiles. Had these expositions of theirs proceeded
   from the orthodox, from such as the great Confessor Hosius, and
   Maximinus [1197] of Gaul, or his successor [1198] , or from such as
   Philogonius and Eustathius [1199] , Bishops of the East [1200] , or
   Julius and Liberius of Rome, or Cyriacus of Moesia [1201] , or Pistus
   and AristÃ¦us of Greece, or Silvester and Protogenes of Dacia, or
   Leontius and Eupsychius of Cappadocia, or CÃ¦cilianus of Africa, or
   Eustorgius of Italy, or Capito of Sicily, or Macarius of Jerusalem, or
   Alexander of Constantinople, or PÃ¦deros of Heraclea, or those great
   Bishops Meletius, Basil, and Longianus, and the rest from Armenia and
   Pontus, or Lupus and Amphion from Cilicia, or James [1202] and the rest
   from Mesopotamia, or our own blessed Alexander, with others of the same
   opinions as these;--there would then have been nothing to suspect in
   their statements, for the character of apostolical men is sincere and
   incapable of fraud.

   9. For such words do but serve as their cloak.

   But when they proceed from those who are hired to advocate the cause of
   heresy, and since, according to the divine proverb, The words of the
   wicked are to lie in wait,' and The mouth of the wicked poureth out
   evil things,' and The counsels of the wicked are deceit [1203] :' it
   becomes us to watch and be sober, brethren, as the Lord has said, lest
   any deception arise from subtlety of speech and craftiness; lest any
   one come and pretend to say, I preach Christ,' and after a little while
   he be found to be Antichrist. These indeed are Antichrists, whosoever
   come to you in the cause of the Arian madness. For what defect is there
   among you, that any one need to come to you from without? Or, of what
   do the Churches of Egypt and Libya and Alexandria stand so much in
   need, that these men should make a purchase [1204] of the Episcopate
   instead of wood and goods, and intrude into Churches which do not
   belong to them? Who is not aware, who does not perceive clearly, that
   they do all this in order to support their impiety? Wherefore although
   they should make themselves dumb, or although they should bind on their
   garments larger borders than the Pharisees, and pour themselves forth
   in long speeches, and practise the tones of their voice [1205] , they
   ought not to be believed; for it is not the mode of speaking, but the
   intentions of the heart and a godly conversation that recommend the
   faithful Christian. And thus the Sadducees and Herodians, although they
   have the law in their mouths, were put to rebuke by our Saviour, who
   said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of
   God [1206] :' and all men witnessed the exposure of those who pretended
   to quote the words of the Law, as being in their minds heretics and
   enemies of God [1207] . Others indeed they deceived by these
   professions, but when our Lord became man they were not able to deceive
   Him; for the Word was made Flesh,' who knoweth the thoughts of men that
   they are vain.' Thus He exposed the carping of the Jews, saying, If God
   were your Father, ye would love Me, for I proceeded forth from the
   Father, and am come to you [1208] .' In like manner these men seem now
   to act; for they disguise their real sentiments, and then make use of
   the language of Scripture for their writings, which they hold forth as
   a bait for the ignorant, that they may inveigle them into their own
   wickedness.

   10. They ought first to condemn Arius, if they are to be heard.

   Consider, whether this be not so. If, when there is no reason for their
   doing so, they write confessions of faith, it is a superfluous, and
   perhaps also a mischievous proceeding, because, when there is no
   enquiry, they offer occasion for controversy of words, and unsettle the
   simple hearts of the brethren, disseminating among them such notions as
   have never entered into their minds. And if they are attempting to
   write a defence of themselves in regard to the Arian heresy, they ought
   first to have removed the seeds of those evils which have sprung up,
   and to have proscribed those who produced them, and then in the room of
   former statements to set forth others which are sound; or else let them
   openly vindicate the opinions of Arius, that they may no longer
   covertly but openly shew themselves enemies of Christ, and that all men
   may fly from them as from the face of a serpent. But now they keep back
   those opinions, and for a pretence write on other matters; just as if a
   surgeon, when summoned to attend a person wounded and suffering, should
   upon coming in to him say not a word concerning his wounds, but proceed
   to discourse about his sound limbs. Such an one would be chargeable
   with utter stupidity, for saying nothing on the matter for which he
   came, but discoursing on those other points in which he was not needed.
   Yet just in the same manner these men omit those matters which concern
   their heresy, and take upon themselves to write on other subjects;
   whereas if they had any regard for the Faith, or any love for Christ,
   they ought first to have removed out of the way those blasphemous
   expressions uttered against Him, and then in the room of them to speak
   and to write the sound words. But this they neither do themselves, nor
   permit those that desire to do so, whether it be from ignorance, or
   through craft and artifice.

   11. No profit to do right in one way, if we do wrong in another.

   If they do this from ignorance they must be charged with rashness,
   because they affirm positively concerning things that they know not;
   but if they dissemble knowingly, their condemnation is the greater,
   because while they overlook nothing in consulting for their own
   interests, in writing about faith in our Lord they make a mockery, and
   do anything rather than speak the truth; they keep back those
   particulars respecting which their heresy is accused, and merely bring
   forward the language of the Scriptures. Now this is a manifest theft of
   the truth, and a practice full of all iniquity; and so I am sure your
   piety will readily perceive it to be from the following illustrations.
   No person being accused of adultery defends himself as innocent of
   theft; nor would any one in prosecuting a charge of murder suffer the
   accused parties to defend themselves by saying, We have not committed
   perjury, but have preserved the deposit which was entrusted to us.'
   This would be mere child's play, instead of a refutation of the charge
   and a demonstration of the truth. For what has murder to do with a
   deposit, or adultery with theft? The vices are indeed related to each
   other as proceeding from the same heart; yet in respect to the
   refutation of an alleged offence, they have no connection with each
   other. Accordingly as it is written in the Book of Joshua [1209] the
   son of Nun, when Achan was charged with theft, he did not excuse
   himself with the plea of his zeal in the wars; but being convicted of
   the offence was stoned by all the people. And when Saul was charged
   with negligence and a breach of the law, he did not benefit his cause
   by alleging his conduct on other matters [1210] . For a defence on one
   count will not operate to obtain an acquittal on another count; but if
   all things should be done according to law and justice, a man must
   defend himself in those particulars wherein he is accused, and must
   either disprove the past, or else confess it with the promise that he
   will desist, and do so no more. But if he is guilty of the crime, and
   will not confess, but in order to conceal the truth speaks on other
   points instead of the one in question, he shews plainly that he has
   acted amiss, nay, and is conscious of his delinquency. But what need of
   many words, seeing that these persons are themselves accusers of the
   Arian heresy? For since they have not the boldness to speak out, but
   conceal their blasphemous expressions, it is plain that they know that
   this heresy is separate and alien from the truth. But since they
   themselves conceal it and are afraid to speak, it is necessary for me
   to strip off the veil from their impiety, and to expose the heresy to
   public view, knowing as I do the statements which Arius and his fellows
   formerly made, and how they were cast out of the Church, and degraded
   from the Clergy. But here first I ask for pardon [1211] of the foul
   words which I am about to produce, since I use them, not because I thus
   think, but in order to convict the heretics.

   Chapter II.

   12. Arian statements.

   Now the Bishop Alexander of blessed memory cast Arius out of the Church
   for holding and maintaining the following opinions: God was not always
   a Father: The Son was not always: But whereas all things were made out
   of nothing, the Son of God also was made out of nothing: And since all
   things are creatures, He also is a creature and a thing made: And since
   all things once were not, but were afterwards made, there was a time
   when the Word of God Himself was not; and He was not before He was
   begotten, but He had a beginning of existence: For He has then
   originated when God has chosen to produce Him: For He also is one among
   the rest of His works. And since He is by nature changeable, and only
   continues good because He chooses by His own free will, He is capable
   of being changed, as are all other things, whenever He wishes. And
   therefore God, as foreknowing that He would be good, gave Him by
   anticipation that glory which He would have obtained afterwards by His
   virtue; and He is now become good by His works which God foreknew.'
   Accordingly they say, that Christ is not truly God, but that He is
   called God on account of His participation in God's nature, as are all
   other creatures. And they add, that He is not that Word which is by
   nature in the Father, and is proper to His Essence, nor is He His
   proper wisdom by which He made this world; but that there is another
   Word [1212] which is properly in the Father, and another Wisdom which
   is properly in the Father, by which Wisdom also He made this Word; and
   that the Lord Himself is called the Word (Reason) conceptually in
   regard of things endued with reason, and is called Wisdom conceptually
   in regard of things endued with wisdom. Nay, they say that as all
   things are in essence separate and alien from the Father, so He also is
   in all respects separate and alien from the essence of the Father, and
   properly belongs to things made and created, and is one of them; for He
   is a creature, and a thing made, and a work. Again, they say [1213]
   that God did not create us for His sake, but Him for our sakes. For
   they say, God was alone, and the Word was not with Him, but afterwards
   when He would produce us, then He made Him; and from the time He was
   made, He called Him the Word, and the Son, and the Wisdom, in order
   that He might create us by Him. And as all things subsisted by the will
   of God, and did not exist before; so He also was made by the will of
   God, and did not exist before. For the Word is not the proper and
   natural Offspring of the Father, but has Himself originated by grace:
   for God who existed made by His will the Son who did not exist, by
   which will also He made all things, and produced, and created, and
   willed them to come into being.' Moreover they say also, that Christ is
   not the natural and true power of God; but as the locust and the
   cankerworm are called a power [1214] , so also He is called the power
   of the Father. Furthermore he said, that the Father is secret from the
   Son, and that the Son can neither see nor know the Father perfectly and
   exactly. For having a beginning of existence, He cannot know Him that
   is without beginning; but what He knows and sees, He knows and sees in
   a measure proportionate to His own measure, as we also know and see in
   proportion to our powers. And he added also, that the Son not only does
   not know His own Father exactly, but that He does not even know His own
   essence.

   13. Arguments from Scripture against Arian statements.

   For maintaining these and the like opinions Arius was declared a
   heretic; for myself, while I have merely been writing them down, I have
   been cleansing myself by thinking of the contrary doctrines, and by
   holding fast the sense of the true faith. For the Bishops who all
   assembled from all parts at the Council of NicÃ¦a, began to hold their
   ears at these statements, and all with one voice condemned this heresy
   on account of them, and anathematized it, declaring it to be alien and
   estranged from the faith of the Church. It was no compulsion which led
   the judges to this decision, but they all deliberately vindicated the
   truth [1215] : and they did so justly and rightly. For infidelity is
   coming in through these men, or rather a Judaism counter to the
   Scriptures, which has close upon it Gentile superstition, so that he
   who holds these opinions can no longer be even called a Christian, for
   they are all contrary to the Scriptures. John, for instance, saith, In
   the beginning was the Word [1216] ;' but these men say, He was not,
   before He was begotten.' And again he wrote, And we are in Him that is
   true, even in His Son Jesus Christ; this is the true God, and eternal
   life [1217] ;' but these men, as if in contradiction to this, allege
   that Christ is not the true God, but that He is only called God, as are
   other creatures, in regard of His participation in the divine nature.
   And the Apostle blames the Gentiles, because they worship the
   creatures, saying, They served the creature more than' God the Creator
   [1218] .' But if these men say that the Lord is a creature, and worship
   Him as a creature, how do they differ from the Gentiles? If they hold
   this opinion, is not this passage also against them; and does not the
   blessed Paul write as blaming them? The Lord also says, I and My Father
   are One:' and He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father [1219] ;' and
   the Apostle who was sent by Him to preach, writes, Who being the
   Brightness of His glory, and the express Image of His Person [1220] .'
   But these men dare to separate them, and to say that He is alien from
   the essence and eternity of the Father; and impiously to represent Him
   as changeable, not perceiving, that by speaking thus, they make Him to
   be, not one with the Father, but one with created things. Who does not
   see, that the brightness cannot be separated from the light, but that
   it is by nature proper to it, and co-existent with it, and is not
   produced after it? Again, when the Father says, This is My beloved Son
   [1221] ,' and when the Scriptures say that He is the Word' of the
   Father, by whom the heavens were established [1222] ,' and in short,
   All things were made by Him [1223] ;' these inventors of new doctrines
   and fictions represent that there is another Word, and another Wisdom
   of the Father, and that He is only called the Word and the Wisdom
   conceptually on account of things endued with reason, while they
   perceive not the absurdity of this.

   14. Arguments from Scripture against Arian statements.

   But if He be styled the Word and the Wisdom by a fiction on our
   account, what He really is they cannot tell [1224] . For if the
   Scriptures affirm that the Lord is both these, and yet these men will
   not allow Him to be so, it is plain that in their godless opposition to
   the Scriptures they would deny His existence altogether. The faithful
   are able to conclude this truth both from the voice of the Father
   Himself, and from the Angels that worshipped Him, and from the Saints
   that have written concerning Him; but these men, as they have not a
   pure mind, and cannot bear to hear the words of divine men who teach of
   God, may be able to learn something even from the devils who resemble
   them, for they spoke of Him, not as if there were many besides, but, as
   knowing Him alone, they said, Thou art the Holy One of God,' and the
   Son of God [1225] .' He also who suggested to them this heresy, while
   tempting Him, in the mount, said not, If Thou also be a Son of God,' as
   though there were others besides Him, but, If Thou be the [1226] Son of
   God,' as being the only one. But as the Gentiles, having fallen from
   the notion of one God, have sunk into polytheism, so these wonderful
   men, not believing that the Word of the Father is one, have come to
   adopt the idea of many words, and they deny Him that is really God and
   the true Word, and have dared to conceive of Him as a creature, not
   perceiving how full of impiety is the thought. For if He be a creature,
   how is He at the same time the Creator of creatures? or how the Son and
   the Wisdom and the Word? For the Word is not created, but begotten; and
   a creature is not a Son, but a production. And if all creatures were
   made by Him, and He is also a creature, then by whom was He made?
   Things made must of necessity originate through some one; as in fact
   they have originated through the Word; because He was not Himself a
   thing made, but the Word of the Father. And again, if there be another
   wisdom in the Father beside the Lord, then Wisdom has originated in
   wisdom: and if the Word of God be the Wisdom of God, then the Word has
   originated in a word: and if the Son be the Word of God, then the Son
   must have been made in the Son.

   15. Arguments from Scripture against Arian statements.

   How is it that the Lord has said, I am in the Father, and the Father in
   Me [1227] ,' if there be another in the Father, by whom the Lord
   Himself also was made? And how is it that John, passing over that
   other, relates of this One, saying, All things were made by Him; and
   without Him was not any thing made [1228] ?' If all things that were
   made by the will of God were made by Him, how can He be Himself one of
   the things that were made? And when the Apostle says, For whom are all
   things, and by whom are all things [1229] ,' how can these men say,
   that we were not made for Him, but He for us? If it be so, He ought to
   have said, For whom the Word was made;' but He saith not so, but, For
   whom are all things, and by whom are all things,' thus proving these
   men to be heretical and false. But further, as they have had the
   boldness to say that there is another Word in God, and since they
   cannot bring any clear proof of this from the Scriptures, let them but
   shew one work of His, or one work of the Father that was done without
   this Word; so that they may seem to have some ground at least for their
   own idea. The works of the true Word are manifest to all, so as for Him
   to be contemplated by analogy from them. For as, when we see the
   creation, we conceive of God as the Creator of it; so when we see that
   nothing is without order therein, but that all things move and continue
   with order and providence, we infer a Word of God who is over all and
   governs all. This too the holy Scriptures testify, declaring that He is
   the Word of God, and that all things were made by Him, and without Him
   was not any thing made [1230] .' But of that other Word, of whom they
   speak, there is neither word nor work that they have to shew. Nay, even
   the Father Himself, when He says, This is My beloved Son [1231] ,'
   signifies that besides Him there is none other

   16. Arians parallel to the Manichees.

   It appears then that so far as these doctrines are concerned, these
   wonderful men have now joined themselves to the Manichees. For these
   also confess the existence of a good God, so far as the mere name goes,
   but they are unable to point out any of His works either visible or
   invisible. But inasmuch as they deny Him who is truly and indeed God,
   the Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things invisible, they are
   mere inventors of fables. And this appears to me to be the case with
   these evil-minded men. They see the works of the true Word who alone is
   in the Father, and yet they deny Him, and make to themselves another
   Word [1232] , whose existence they are unable to prove either by His
   Works or by the testimony of others. Unless it be that they have
   adopted a fabulous notion of God, that He is a composite being like
   man, speaking and then changing His words, and as a man exercising
   understanding and wisdom; not perceiving to what absurdities they are
   reduced by such an opinion. For if God has a succession of words [1233]
   , they certainly must consider Him as a man. And if those words proceed
   from Him and then vanish away, they are guilty of a greater impiety,
   because they resolve into nothing what proceeds from the self-existent
   God. If they conceive that God doth at all beget, it were surely better
   and more religious to say that He is the begetter of One Word, who is
   the fulness of His Godhead, in whom are hidden the treasures of all
   knowledge [1234] , and that He is co-existent with His Father, and that
   all things were made by Him; rather than to suppose God to be the
   Father of many words which are nowhere to be found, or to represent Him
   who is simple in His nature as compounded of many [1235] , and as being
   subject to human passions and variable. Next whereas the Apostle says,
   Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God [1236] ,' these men
   reckon Him but as one among many powers; nay, worse than this, they
   compare Him, transgressors as they are, with the cankerworm and other
   irrational creatures which are sent by Him for the punishment of men.
   Next, whereas the Lord says, No one knoweth the Father, save the Son
   [1237] ;' and again, Not that any man hath seen the Father save He
   which is of the Father [1238] ;' are not these indeed enemies of God
   which say that the Father is neither seen nor known of the Son
   perfectly? If the Lord says, As the Father knoweth Me, even so know I
   the Father [1239] ,' and if the Father knows not the Son partially, are
   they not mad to say idly that the Son knows the Father only partially,
   and not fully? Next, if the Son has a beginning of existence, and all
   things likewise have a beginning, let them say, which is prior to the
   other. But indeed they have nothing to say, neither can they with all
   their craft prove such a beginning of the Word. For He is the true and
   proper Offspring of the Father, and in the beginning was the Word, and
   the Word was with God, and the Word was God [1240] .' For with regard
   to their assertion, that the Son knows not His own essence, it is
   superfluous to reply to it, except only so far as to condemn their
   madness; for how does not the Word know Himself, when He imparts to all
   men the knowledge of His Father and of Himself, and blames those who
   know not themselves?

   17. Arguments from Scripture against Arian statements.

   But it is written [1241] , say they, The Lord created me in the
   beginning of His ways for His works.' O untaught and insensate that ye
   are! He is called also in the Scriptures, servant [1242] ,' and son of
   a handmaid,' and lamb,' and sheep,' and it is said that He suffered
   toil, and thirst, and was beaten, and has suffered pain. But there is
   plainly a reasonable ground and cause [1243] , why such representations
   as these are given of Him in the Scriptures; and it is because He
   became man and the Son of man, and took upon Him the form of a servant,
   which is the human flesh: for the Word,' says John, was made flesh
   [1244] .' And since He became man, no one ought to be offended at such
   expressions; for it is proper to man to be created, and born, and
   formed, to suffer toil and pain, to die and to rise again from the
   dead. And as, being Word and Wisdom of the Father, He has all the
   attributes of the Father, His eternity, and His unchangeableness, and
   the being like Him in all respects and in all things [1245] , and is
   neither before nor after, but co-existent with the Father, and is the
   very form [1246] of the Godhead, and is the Creator, and is not
   created: (for since He is in essence like [1247] the Father, He cannot
   be a creature, but must be the Creator, as Himself hath said, My Father
   worketh hitherto, and I work [1248] :') so being made man, and bearing
   our flesh, He is necessarily said to be created and made, and that is
   proper to all flesh; however, these men, like Jewish vintners, who mix
   their wine with water [1249] , debase the Word, and subject His Godhead
   to their notions of created things. Wherefore the Fathers were with
   reason and justice indignant, and anathematized this most impious
   heresy; which these persons are now cautious of and keep back, as being
   easy to be disproved and unsound in every part of it. These that I have
   set down are but a few of the arguments which go to condemn their
   doctrines; but if any one desires to enter more at large into the proof
   against them, he will find that this heresy is not far removed from
   heathenism, and that it is the lowest and the very dregs of all the
   other heresies. These last are in error either concerning the body or
   the incarnation of the Lord, falsifying the truth, some in one way and
   some in another, or else they deny that the Lord has sojourned here at
   all, as the Jews erroneously suppose. But this one alone more madly
   than the rest has dared to assail the very Godhead, and to assert that
   the Word is not at all, and that the Father was not always a father; so
   that one might reasonably say that that Psalm was written against them;
   The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God [1250] . Corrupt are
   they, and become abominable in their doings.'

   18. If the Arians felt they were right, they would speak openly.

   But,' say they, we are strong, and are able to defend our heresy by our
   many devices.' They would have a better answer to give, if they were
   able to defend it, not by artifice nor by Gentile sophisms, but by the
   simplicity of their faith. If however they have confidence in it, and
   know it to be in accordance with the doctrines of the Church, let them
   openly express their sentiments; for no man when he hath lighted a
   candle putteth it under the bushel [1251] , but on the candlestick, and
   so it gives light to all that come in. If therefore they are able to
   defend it, let them record in writing the opinions above imputed to
   them, and expose their heresy bare to the view of all men, as they
   would a candle, and let them openly accuse the Bishop Alexander, of
   blessed memory, as having unjustly ejected [1252] Arius for professing
   these opinions; and let them blame the Council of NicÃ¦a for putting
   forth a written confession of the true faith in place of their impiety.
   But they will not do this, I am sure, for they are not so ignorant of
   the evil nature of those notions which they have invented and are
   ambitious of sowing abroad; but they know well enough, that although
   they may at first lead astray the simple by vain deceit, yet their
   imaginations will soon be extinguished, as the light of the ungodly
   [1253] ,' and themselves branded everywhere as enemies of the Truth.
   Therefore although they do all things foolishly, and speak as fools,
   yet in this at least they have acted wisely, as children of this world
   [1254] ,' hiding their candle under the bushel, that it may be supposed
   to give light, and lest, if it appear, it be condemned and
   extinguished. Thus when Arius himself, the author of the heresy, and
   the associate of Eusebius, was summoned through the interest of
   Eusebius and his fellows to appear before Constantine Augustus of
   blessed memory [1255] , and was required to present a written
   declaration of his faith, the wily man wrote one, but kept out of sight
   the peculiar expressions of his impiety, and pretended, as the Devil
   did, to quote the simple words of Scripture, just as they are written.
   And when the blessed Constantine said to him, If thou holdest no other
   opinions in thy mind besides these, take the Truth to witness for thee;
   the Lord is thy avenger if thou swear falsely:' the unfortunate man
   swore that he held no other, and that he had never either spoken or
   thought otherwise than as he had now written. But as soon as he went
   out he dropped down, as if paying the penalty of his crime, and falling
   headlong burst asunder in the midst [1256] .'

   19. Significance of the death of Arius.

   Death, it is true, is the common end of all men, and we ought not to
   insult the dead, though he be an enemy, for it is uncertain whether the
   same event may not happen to ourselves before evening. But the end of
   Arius was not after an ordinary manner, and therefore it deserves to be
   related. Eusebius and his fellows threatening to bring him into the
   Church, Alexander, the Bishop of Constantinople, resisted them; but
   Arius trusted to the violence and menace of Eusebius. It was the
   Sabbath, and he expected to join communion on the following day. There
   was therefore a great struggle between them; the others threatening,
   Alexander praying. But the Lord being judge of the case, decided
   against the unjust party: for the sun had not set, when the necessities
   of nature compelled him to that place, where he fell down, and was
   forthwith deprived of communion with the Church and of his life
   together. The blessed Constantine hearing of this at once, was struck
   with wonder to find him thus convicted of perjury. And indeed it was
   then evident to all that the threats of Eusebius and his fellows had
   proved of no avail and the hope of Arius had become vain. It was shewn
   too that the Arian madness was rejected from communion by our Saviour
   both here and in the Church of the first-born in heaven. Now who will
   not wonder to see the unrighteous ambition of these men, whom the Lord
   has condemned;--to see them vindicating the heresy which the Lord has
   pronounced excommunicate (since He did not suffer its author to enter
   into the Church), and not fearing that which is written, but attempting
   impossible things? For the Lord of hosts hath purposed, and who shall
   disannul it [1257] ?' and whom God hath condemned, who shall justify?
   Let them however in defence of their own imaginations write what they
   please; but do you, brethren, as bearing the vessels of the Lord [1258]
   ,' and vindicating the doctrines of the Church, examine this matter, I
   beseech you; and if they write in other terms than those above recorded
   as the language of Arius, then condemn them as hypocrites, who hide the
   poison of their opinions, and like the serpent flatter with the words
   of their lips. For, though they thus write, they have associated with
   them those who were formerly rejected with Arius, such as Secundus of
   Pentapolis, and the clergy who were convicted at Alexandria; and they
   write to them in Alexandria. But what is most astonishing, they have
   caused us and our friends to be persecuted, although the most religious
   Emperor Constantine sent us back in peace to our country and Church,
   and shewed his concern for the harmony of the people. But now they have
   caused the Churches to be given up to these men, thus proving to all
   that for their sake the whole conspiracy against us and the rest has
   been carried on from the beginning.

   20. While they are friends of Arius, in vain their moderate words.

   Now while such is their conduct, how can they claim credit for what
   they write? Had the opinions they have put in writing been orthodox,
   they would have expunged from their list of books the Thalia of Arius,
   and have rejected the scions of the heresy, viz. those disciples of
   Arius, and the partners of his impiety and his punishment. But since
   they do not renounce these, it is manifest to all that their sentiments
   are not orthodox, though they write them over ten thousand times [1259]
   . Wherefore it becomes us to watch, lest some deception be conveyed
   under the clothing of their phrases, and they lead away certain from
   the true faith. And if they venture to advance the opinions of Arius,
   when they see themselves proceeding in a prosperous course, nothing
   remains for us but to use great boldness of speech, remembering the
   predictions of the Apostle, which he wrote to forewarn us of such like
   heresies, and which it becomes us to repeat. For we know that, as it is
   written, in the latter times some shall depart from the sound faith,
   giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils, that turn
   from the truth [1260] ;' and, as many as will live godly in Christ
   shall suffer persecution. But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and
   worse, deceiving and being deceived.' But none of these things shall
   prevail over us, nor separate us from the love of Christ [1261] ,'
   though the heretics threaten us with death. For we are Christians, not
   Arians [1262] ; would that they too, who have written these things, had
   not embraced the doctrines of Arius! Yea, brethren, there is need now
   of such boldness of speech; for we have not received the spirit of
   bondage again to fear [1263] ,' but God hath called us to liberty
   [1264] .' And it were indeed disgraceful to us, most disgraceful, were
   we, on account of Arius or of those who embrace and advocate his
   sentiments, to destroy the faith which we have received from our
   Saviour through His Apostles. Already very many in these parts,
   perceiving the craftiness of these writers, are ready even unto blood
   to oppose their wiles, especially since they have heard of your
   firmness. And seeing that the refutation of the heresy has gone forth
   from you [1265] , and it has been drawn forth from its concealment,
   like a serpent from his hole, the Child that Herod sought to destroy is
   preserved among you, and the Truth lives in you, and the Faith thrives
   among you.

   21. To make a stand for the Faith equivalent to martyrdom.

   Wherefore I exhort you, keeping in your hands the confession which was
   framed by the Fathers at NicÃ¦a, and defending it with great zeal and
   confidence in the Lord, be ensamples to the brethren everywhere, and
   shew them that a struggle is now before us in support of the Truth
   against heresy, and that the wiles of the enemy are various. For the
   proof of a martyr lies [1266] not only in refusing to burn incense to
   idols; but to refuse to deny the Faith is also an illustrious testimony
   of a good conscience. And not only those who turned aside unto idols
   were condemned as aliens, but those also who betrayed the Truth. Thus
   Judas was degraded from the Apostolical office, not because he
   sacrificed to idols, but because he proved a traitor; and HymenÃ¦us and
   Alexander fell away not by betaking themselves to the service of idols,
   but because they made shipwreck concerning the faith [1267] .' On the
   other hand, the Patriarch Abraham received the crown, not because he
   suffered death, but because he was faithful unto God; and the other
   Saints, of whom Paul speaks [1268] , Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephtha,
   David and Samuel, and the rest, were not made perfect by the shedding
   of their blood, but by faith they were justified; and to this day they
   are the objects of our admiration, as being ready even to suffer death
   for piety towards the Lord. And if one may add an instance from our own
   country, ye know how the blessed Alexander contended even unto death
   against this heresy, and what great afflictions and labours, old man as
   He was, he sustained, until in extreme age he also was gathered to his
   fathers. And how many beside have undergone great toil, in their
   teachings against this impiety, and now enjoy in Christ the glorious
   reward of their confession! Wherefore, let us also, considering that
   this struggle is for our all, and that the choice is now before us,
   either to deny or to preserve the faith, let us also make it our
   earnest care and aim to guard what we have received, taking as our
   instruction the Confession drawn up at NicÃ¦a, and let us turn away from
   novelties, and teach our people not to give heed to seducing spirits
   [1269] ,' but altogether to withdraw from the impiety of the Arian
   madmen, and from the coalition which the Meletians have made with them.

   22. Coalition of sordid Meletians with insane Arians.

   For you perceive how, though they were formerly at variance with one
   another, they have now, like Herod and Pontius, agreed together in
   order to blaspheme our Lord Jesus Christ. And for this they truly
   deserve the hatred of every man, because they were at enmity with one
   another on private grounds, but have now become friends and join hands,
   in their hostility to the Truth and their impiety towards God. Nay,
   they are content to do or suffer anything, however contrary to their
   principles, for the satisfaction of securing their several aims; the
   Meletians for the sake of pre-eminence and the mad love of money, and
   the Arian madmen for their own impiety. And thus by this coalition they
   are able to assist one another in their malicious designs, while the
   Meletians put on the impiety of the Arians, and the Arians from their
   own wickedness concur in their baseness, so that by thus mingling
   together their respective crimes, like the cup of Babylon [1270] , they
   may carry on their plots against the orthodox worshippers of our Lord
   Jesus Christ. The wickedness and falsehood of the Meletians were indeed
   even before this evident unto all men; so too the impiety and godless
   heresy of the Arians have long been known everywhere and to all; for
   the period of their existence has not been a short one. The former
   became schismatics five and fifty years ago, and it is thirty-six years
   since the latter were pronounced heretics [1271] , and they were
   rejected from the Church by the judgment of the whole Ecumenic Council.
   But by their present proceedings they have proved at length, even to
   those who seem openly to favour them, that they have carried on their
   designs against me and the rest of the orthodox Bishops from the very
   first solely for the sake of advancing their own impious heresy. For
   observe, that which was long ago the great object of Eusebius and his
   fellows is now brought about. They have caused the Churches to be
   snatched out of our hands, they have banished as they pleased, the
   Bishops and Presbyters who refused to communicate with them; and the
   people who withdrew from them they have excluded from the Churches,
   which they have given up into the hands of the Arians who were
   condemned so long ago, so that with the assistance of the hypocrisy of
   the Meletians they can without fear pour forth in them their impious
   language, and make ready, as they think, the way of deceit for
   Antichrist [1272] , who sowed among them the seeds of this heresy.

   23. Conclusion.

   Let them however thus dream and imagine vain things. We know that when
   our gracious Emperor shall hear of it, he will put a stop to their
   wickedness, and they will not continue long, but according to the words
   of Scripture, the hearts of the impious shall quickly fail them [1273]
   .' But let us, as it is written, put on the words of holy Scripture
   [1274] ,' and resist them as apostates who would set up fanaticism in
   the house of the Lord. And let us not fear the death of the body, nor
   let us emulate their ways; but let the word of Truth be preferred
   before all things. We also, as you all know, were formerly required
   [1275] by Eusebius and his fellows either to put on their impiety, or
   to expect their hostility; but we would not engage ourselves with them,
   but chose rather to be persecuted by them, than to imitate the conduct
   of Judas. And assuredly they have done what they threatened; for after
   the manner of Jezebel, they engaged the treacherous Meletians to assist
   them, knowing how the latter resisted the blessed martyr Peter, and
   after him the great Achillas, and then Alexander, of blessed memory, in
   order that, as being practised in such matters, the Meletians might
   pretend against us also whatever might be suggested to them, while
   Eusebius and his fellows gave them an opening for persecuting and for
   seeking to kill me. For this is what they thirst after; and they
   continue to this day to desire to shed my blood. But of these things I
   have no care; for I know and am persuaded that they who endure shall
   receive a reward from our Saviour; and that ye also, if ye endure as
   the Fathers did, and shew yourselves examples to the people, and
   overthrow these strange and alien devices of impious men, shall be able
   to glory, and say, We have kept the Faith [1276] ;' and ye shall
   receive the crown of life,' which God hath promised to them that love
   Him [1277] .' And God grant that I also together with you may inherit
   the promises, which, were given, not to Paul only, but also to all them
   that have loved the appearing [1278] ' of our Lord, and Saviour, and
   God, and universal King, Jesus Christ; through whom to the Father be
   glory and dominion in the Holy Spirit, both now and for ever, world
   without end [1279] . Amen.

   Introduction to Apologia Ad Constantium.

   ------------------------

   This address to the Emperor in defence against certain serious charges
   (see below) was completed about the time of the intrusion of George,
   who arrived at Alexandria on Feb. 24, 357. The main, or apologetic,
   part of the letter was probably composed before George's actual
   arrival, in fact at about the same date as the encyclical letter which
   immediately precedes; Â§Â§27 and following (see 27, note 2) forming an
   added expostulation upon hearing of the general expulsion of Catholic
   Bishops, and of the outrages [1280] at Alexandria. It is quite
   uncertain whether it ever reached the emperor; whether it did so or
   not, his attitude toward Athanasius was in no way affected by it. It
   had probably been begun with the idea of its being actually delivered
   in the presence of Constantius (see Â§Â§3, 6, 8, 16 I see you smile,'
   22), but, although by a rhetorical fiction the form of an oral defence
   is kept up to the end, the concluding sections (27, 32 init.) shew that
   any such idea had been renounced before the Apology was completed. The
   first 26 sections are directed to the refutation of four personal
   charges, quite different from those of the earlier period, rebutted in
   the Apology against the Arians. They were (1) that Athanasius had
   poisoned the mind of Constans against his brother (2-5). To this Ath.
   replies that he had never spoken to the deceased Augustus except in the
   presence of witnesses, and that the history of his own movements when
   in the West entirely precluded any such possibility. The third and
   fourth sections thus incidentally supply important details for the life
   of Athanasius. (2) That he had written letters to the tyrant'
   Magnentius (6-13), a charge absurd in itself, and only to be borne out
   by forgery, but also amply disproved by his known affection toward
   Constans, the victim of the tyrant.' (3) That he had (14-18) used the
   new church in the CÃ¦sareum,' before it was completed or dedicated, for
   the Easter festival of 355 (Tillem. viii. 149). This Athanasius admits,
   but pleads necessity and precedent, adding that no disrespect was
   intended toward the donor, nor any anticipation of its formal
   consecration. (4) That he had disobeyed an imperial order to leave
   Alexandria and go to Italy (19-26, see esp. 19, n. 4, and Fest. Ind.
   xxvi. Constantius is at Milan July 21, 353--Gwatkin p. 292). This
   charge involves the whole history of the attempts to dislodge
   Athanasius from Alexandria, which culminated in the events of 356. He
   replies to the charge, that the summons in question had come in the
   form of an invitation in reply to an alleged letter of his own asking
   leave to go to Italy, a letter which, as his amanuenses would testify,
   he had never written. Of the later visit (355, Fest. Ind. xxvii.) of
   Diogenes, he merely says that Diogenes brought neither letter nor
   orders. Syrianus, he seems to allow, had verbally ordered him to Italy
   (Constantius was again at Milan,--Gwatkin ubi supra) but without
   written authority. As against these supposed orders, Ath. had a letter
   from the emperor (Â§23) exhorting him to remain at Alexandria, whatever
   reports he might hear. Syrianus had, at the urgent remonstrance of the
   clergy and people, consented to refer the matter back to Constantius
   (24), but without waiting to do this, he had suddenly made his famous
   night attack upon the bishop when holding a vigil service in the Church
   of Theonas. Thereupon Athanasius had set out for Italy to lay the
   matter before the emperor in person (27 init.). But on reaching, as it
   would seem, the Libyan portion of his Province, he was turned back by
   the news of the Council of Milan, and the wholesale banishment which
   followed. Here we pass to the second part of the Apology. He explains
   his return to the desert by the three reports which had reached him:
   first, that just mentioned; secondly, that of further military
   outrages, about Easter 356 (or possibly those of George in 357, see
   Apol. Fug. 6; the clear statements of Fest. Ind. and Hist. Aceph.
   compel us [1281] to place these in the latter year, although on Ã 
   priori grounds we might have followed Tillem., Bright, &c., in placing
   them in 356), and of the nomination of George; thirdly, of the letters
   of Constantius to the Alexandrians and to the Princes of Abyssinia. He
   had accordingly gone into hiding, in fear, not of the Emperor, but of
   the violence of his officers, and as of bounden duty to all (32). He
   concludes with an outspoken denunciation of the treatment of the
   virgins, and by an urgent entreaty to Constantius which supposes the
   imperial listener to be already more than half appeased' (Bright). The
   Apology is the most carefully written work of Athanasius, and has been
   justly praised for its artistic finish and its rhetorical skill' as
   well as for the force and the sustained calmness and dignity of its
   diction. (So Montfaucon, Newman, Gwatkin, &c. Fialon, pp. 286, 292,
   gives some interesting examples of apparent imitation of Demosthenes in
   this and in the two following tracts.) But the violent contrast between
   its almost affectionate respectfulness and the chilly reserve of the
   Apol. pro Fuga, or still more the furious invective of the Arian
   History, is startling, and gives a prima facie justification to Gibbon,
   who (vol. 3, p. 87, Smith's Ed.) charges the great bishop with
   simulating respect to the emperor's face while denouncing him behind
   his back. But although the de Fuga (see introd. there) was written very
   soon after our present Apology, there is no ground for making them
   simultaneous, while its tone (see Ap. Fug. 26, note 7) is very
   different from that of the later Hist. Arian. Doubtless much of the
   material for the invectives of the latter was already ancient history
   when the tract before us was composed. But Constantius was the Emperor,
   the first personage in the Christian world, and Athanasius with the
   feeling of his age, with the memory of the solemn assurances he had
   received from the Emperor (Â§Â§23, 25, 27, Apol. Ar. 51-56, Hist. Ar.
   21-24), would hope all things,' even against hope,' so long as there
   was any apparent chance of influencing Constantius for good; would hope
   in spite of all appearances that the outrages, banishments, and
   intrigues against the faith of NicÃ¦a were the work of the officers, the
   Arian bishops, the eunuchs of the Court, and not of Augustus' himself
   (see Bright, Introd. to this Apology, pp. lxiii.-lxv.).

   Defence Before Constantius.

   ------------------------

   1. Knowing that you have been a Christian for many years [1282] , most
   religious Augustus, and that you are godly by descent, I cheerfully
   undertake to answer for myself at this time;--for I will use the
   language of the blessed Paul, and make him my advocate before you,
   considering that he was a preacher of the truth, and that you are an
   attentive hearer of his words.

   With respect to those ecclesiastical matters, which have been made the
   ground of a conspiracy against me, it is sufficient to refer your Piety
   to the testimony of the many Bishops who have written in my behalf
   [1283] ; enough too is the recantation of Ursacius and Valens [1284] to
   prove to all men, that none of the charges which they set up against me
   had any truth in them. For what evidence can others produce so strong,
   as what they declared in writing? We lied, we invented these things;
   all the accusations against Athanasius are full of falsehood.' To this
   clear proof may be added, if you will vouchsafe to hear it, this
   circumstance that the accusers brought no evidence against Macarius the
   presbyter while we were present; but in our absence [1285] , when they
   were by themselves, they managed the matter as they pleased. Now, the
   Divine Law first of all, and next our own Laws [1286] , have expressly
   declared, that such proceedings are of no force whatsoever. From these
   things your piety, as a lover of God and of the truth, will, I am sure,
   perceive that we are free from all suspicion, and will pronounce our
   opponents to be false accusers.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1282] [cf. Acts xxvi. 2.] Constantius, though here called a Christian,
   was not baptized till his last illness, a.d. 361, and then by the Arian
   Bishop of Antioch, Euzoius. At this time he was 39 years of age.
   Theodoret represents him making a speech to his whole army on one
   occasion, exhorting them to Baptism previous to going to war; and
   recommending all to go thence who could not make up their mind to the
   Sacrament. H. E. iii. 1. Constantius, his grandfather, had rejected
   idolatry and acknowledged the One God, according to Eusebius, V. Const.
   i. 14, though it does not appear that he had embraced Christianity.

   2. The first charge, of setting Constans against Constantius.

   But as to the slanderous charge which has been preferred against me
   before your Grace, respecting correspondence with the most pious
   Augustus, your brother Constans [1287] , of blessed and everlasting
   memory (for my enemies report this of me, and have ventured to assert
   it in writing), the former events [1288] are sufficient to prove this
   also to be untrue. Had it been alleged by another set of persons, the
   matter would indeed have been a fit subject of enquiry, but it would
   have required strong evidence, and open proof in presence of both
   parties: but when the same persons who invented the former charge, are
   the authors also of this, is it not reasonable to conclude from the
   issue of the one, the falsehood of the other? For this cause they again
   conferred together in private, thinking to be able to deceive your
   Piety before I was aware. But in this they failed: you would not listen
   to them as they desired, but patiently gave me an opportunity to make
   my defence. And, in that you were not immediately moved to demand
   vengeance, you acted only as was righteous in a Prince, whose duty it
   is to wait for the defence of the injured party. Which if you will
   vouchsafe to hear, I am confident that in this matter also you will
   condemn those reckless men, who have no fear of that God, who has
   commanded us not to speak falsely before the king [1289] .

   3. He never saw Constans alone.

   But in truth I am ashamed even to have to defend myself against charges
   such as these, which I do not suppose that even the accuser himself
   would venture to make mention of in my presence. For he knows full well
   that he speaks untruly, and that I was never so mad, so reft of my
   senses, as even to be open to the suspicion of having conceived any
   such thing. So that had I been questioned by any other on this subject,
   I would not even have answered, lest, while I was making my defence, my
   hearers should for a time have suspended their judgment concerning me.
   But to your Piety I answer with a loud and clear voice, and stretching
   forth my hand, as I have learned from the Apostle, I call God for a
   record upon my soul [1290] ,' and as it is written in the histories of
   the Kings (let me be allowed to say the same), The Lord is witness, and
   His Anointed is witness [1291] ,' I have never spoken evil of your
   Piety before your brother Constans, the most religious Augustus of
   blessed memory. I did not exasperate him against you, as these have
   falsely accused me. But whenever in my interviews with him he has
   mentioned your Grace (and he did mention you at the time that Thalassus
   [1292] came to Pitybion, and I was staying at Aquileia), the Lord is
   witness, how I spoke of your Piety in terms which I would that God
   would reveal unto your soul, that you might condemn the falsehood of
   these my calumniators. Bear with me, most gracious Augustus, and freely
   grant me your indulgence while I speak of this matter. Your most
   Christian brother was not a man of so light a temper, nor was I a
   person of such a character, that we should communicate together on a
   subject like this, or that I should slander a brother to a brother, or
   speak evil of an emperor before an emperor. I am not so mad, Sire, nor
   have I forgotten that divine utterance which says, Curse not the king,
   no, not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a
   bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall
   tell the matter [1293] .' If then those things, which are spoken in
   secret against you that are kings, are not hidden, it is not incredible
   that I should have spoken against you in the presence of a king, and of
   so many bystanders? For I never saw your brother by myself, nor did he
   ever converse with me in private, but I was always introduced in
   company with the Bishop of the city where I happened to be, and with
   others that chanced to be there. We entered the presence together, and
   together we retired. Fortunatian [1294] , Bishop of Aquileia, can
   testify this, the father Hosius is able to say the same, as also are
   Crispinus, Bishop of Padua, Lucillus of a Verona, Dionysius of LÃ«is,
   and Vincentius of Campania. And although Maximinus of Treveri, and
   Protasius of Milan, are dead, yet Eugenius, who was Master of the
   Palace [1295] , can bear witness for me; for he stood before the veil
   [1296] , and heard what we requested of the Emperor, and what he
   vouchsafed to reply to us.

   4. The movements of Athanasius refute this charge.

   This certainly is sufficient for proof, yet suffer me nevertheless to
   lay before you an account of my travels, which will further lead you to
   condemn the unfounded calumnies of my opponents. When I left Alexandria
   [1297] , I did not go to your brother's head-quarters, or to any other
   persons, but only to Rome; and having laid my case before the Church
   (for this was my only concern), I spent my time in the public worship.
   I did not write to your brother, except when Eusebius and his fellows
   had written to him to accuse me, and I was compelled while yet at
   Alexandria to defend myself; and again when I sent to him volumes
   [1298] containing the holy Scriptures, which he had ordered me to
   prepare for him. It behoves me, while I defend my conduct, to tell the
   truth to your Piety. When however three years had passed away, he wrote
   to me in the fourth year [1299] , commanding me to meet him (he was
   then at Milan); and upon enquiring the cause (for I was ignorant of it,
   the Lord is my witness), I learnt that certain Bishops [1300] had gone
   up and requested him to write to your Piety, desiring that a Council
   might be called. Believe me, Sire, this is the truth of the matter; I
   lie not. Accordingly I went down to Milan, and met with great kindness
   from him; for he condescended to see me, and to say that he had
   despatched letters to you, requesting that a Council might be called.
   And while I remained in that city, he sent for me again into Gaul (for
   the father Hosius was going thither), that we might travel from thence
   to Sardica. And after the Council, he wrote to me while I continued at
   Naissus [1301] , and I went up, and abode afterwards at Aquileia; where
   the letters of your Piety found me. And again, being invited thence by
   your departed brother, I returned into Gaul, and so came at length to
   your Piety.

   [1300] Tillemont supposes that Constans was present at the Council of

   5. No possible time or place for the alleged offence.

   Now what place and time does my accuser specify, at which I made use of
   these expressions according to his slanderous imputation? In whose
   presence was I so mad as to give utterance to the words which he has
   falsely charged me with speaking? Who is there ready to support the
   charge, and to testify to the fact? What his own eyes have seen that
   ought he to speak [1302] , as holy Scripture enjoins. But no; he will
   find no witnesses of that which never took place. But I take your Piety
   to witness, together with the Truth, that I lie not. I request you, for
   I know you to be a person of excellent memory, to call to mind the
   conversation I had with you, when you condescended to see me, first at
   Viminacium [1303] , a second time at CÃ¦sarea in Cappadocia, and a third
   [1304] time at Antioch. Did I speak evil before you even of Eusebius
   and his fellows who had persecuted me? Did I cast imputations upon any
   of those that have done me wrong? If then I imputed nothing to any of
   those against whom I had a right to speak, how could I be so possessed
   with madness as to slander an Emperor before an Emperor, and to set a
   brother at variance with a brother? I beseech you, either cause me to
   appear before you that the thing may be proved, or else condemn these
   calumnies, and follow the example of David, who says, Whoso privily
   slandereth his neighbour, him will I destroy [1305] .' As much as in
   them lies, they have slain me; for the mouth that belieth, slayeth the
   soul [1306] .' But your long-suffering has prevailed against them, and
   given me confidence to defend myself, that they may suffer
   condemnation, as contentious and slanderous persons. Concerning your
   most religious brother, of blessed memory, this may suffice: for you
   will be able, according to the wisdom which God has given you, to
   gather much from the little I have said, and to recognise the
   fictitious charge.

   6. The second charge, of corresponding with Magnentius.

   With regard to the second calumny, that I have written letters to the
   tyrant [1307] (his name I am unwilling to pronounce), I beseech you
   investigate and try the matter, in whatever way you please, and by
   whomsoever you may approve of. The extravagance of the charge so
   confounds me, that I am in utter uncertainty how to act. Believe me,
   most religious Prince, many times did I weigh the matter in my mind,
   but was unable to believe that any one could be so mad as to utter such
   a falsehood. But when this charge was published abroad by the Arians,
   as well as the former, and they boasted that they had delivered to you
   a copy of the letter, I was the more amazed, and I used to pass
   sleepless nights contending against the charge, as if in the presence
   of my accusers; and suddenly breaking forth into a loud cry, I would
   immediately fall to my prayers, desiring with groans and tears that I
   might obtain a favourable hearing from you. And now that by the grace
   of the Lord, I have obtained such a hearing, I am again at a loss how I
   shall begin my defence; for as often as I make an attempt to speak, I
   am prevented by my horror at the deed. In the case of your departed
   brother, the slanderers had indeed a plausible pretence for what they
   alleged; because I had been admitted to see him, and he had
   condescended to write to your brotherly affection concerning me; and he
   had often sent for me to come to him, and had honoured me when I came.
   But for the traitor Magnentius, the Lord is witness, and His Anointed
   is witness [1308] ,' I know him not, nor was ever acquainted with him.
   What correspondence then could there be between persons so entirely
   unacquainted with each other? What reason was there to induce me to
   write to such a man? How could I have commenced my letter, had I
   written to him? Could I have said, You have done well to murder the man
   who honoured me, whose kindness I shall never forget?' Or, I approve of
   your conduct in destroying our Christian friends, and most faithful
   brethren?' or, I approve of your proceedings in butchering those who so
   kindly entertained me at Rome; for instance, your departed Aunt
   Eutropia [1309] , whose disposition answered to her name, that worthy
   man, Abuterius, the most faithful Spirantius, and many other excellent
   persons?'

   his mother, and a number of his adherents, some of whom are here
   mentioned.
     __________________________________________________________________

   7. This charge utterly incredible and absurd.

   Is it not mere madness in my accuser even to suspect me of such a
   thing? What, I ask again, could induce me to place confidence in this
   man? What trait did I perceive in his character on which I could rely?
   He had murdered his own master; he had proved faithless to his friends;
   he had violated his oath; he had blasphemed God, by consulting
   poisoners and sorcerers [1310] contrary to his Law. And with what
   conscience could I send greeting to such a man, whose madness and
   cruelty had afflicted not me only, but all the world around me? To be
   sure, I was very greatly indebted to him for his conduct, that when
   your departed brother had filled our churches with sacred offerings, he
   murdered him. For the wretch was not moved by the sight of these his
   gifts, nor did he stand in awe of the divine grace which had been given
   to him in baptism: but like an accursed and devilish spirit, he raged
   against him, till your blessed brother suffered martyrdom at his hands;
   while he, henceforth a criminal like Cain, was driven from place to
   place, groaning and trembling [1311] ,' to the end that he might follow
   the example of Judas in his death, by becoming his own executioner, and
   so bring upon himself a double weight of punishment in the judgment to
   come.

   8. Disproof of It.

   With such a man the slanderer thought that I had been on terms of
   friendship, or rather he did not think so, but like an enemy invented
   an incredible fiction: for he knows full well that he has lied. I would
   that, whoever he is, he were present here, that I might put the
   question to him on the word of Truth itself (for whatever we speak as
   in the presence of God, we Christians consider as an oath [1312] ); I
   say, that I might ask him this question, which of us rejoiced most in
   the well-being of the departed Constans? who prayed for him most
   earnestly? The facts of the foregoing charge prove this; indeed it is
   plain to every one how the case stands. But although he himself knows
   full well, that no one who was so disposed towards the departed
   Constans, and who truly loved him, could be a friend to his enemy, I
   fear that being possessed with other feelings towards him than I was,
   he has falsely attributed to me those sentiments of hatred which were
   entertained by himself.

   9. Athanasius could not write to one who did not even know him.

   For myself, I am so surprised at the enormity of the thing, that I am
   quite uncertain what I ought to say in my defence. I can only declare,
   that I condemn myself to die ten thousand deaths, if even the least
   suspicion attaches to me in this matter. And to you, Sire, as a lover
   of the truth, I confidently make my appeal. I beseech you, as I said
   before, investigate this affair, and especially with the testimony of
   those who were once sent by him as ambassadors to you. These are the
   Bishops Sarvatius [1313] and Maximus and the rest, with Clementius and
   Valens. Enquire of them, I beseech you, whether they brought letters to
   me. If they did, this would give me occasion to write to him. But if he
   did not write to me, if he did not even know me, how could I write to
   one with whom I had no acquaintance? Ask them whether, when I saw
   Clementius and his fellows, and spoke of your brother of blessed
   memory, I did not, in the language of Scripture, wet my garments with
   tears [1314] , when I remembered his kindness of disposition and his
   Christian spirit. Learn of them how anxious I was, on hearing of the
   cruelty of the beast, and finding that Valens and his company had come
   by way of Libya, lest he should attempt a passage also, and like a
   robber murder those who held in love and memory the departed Prince,
   among whom I account myself second to none.

   10. His loyalty towards Constantius and his brother.

   How with this apprehension of such a design on their part, was there
   not an additional probability of my praying for your Grace? Should I
   feel affection for his murderer, and entertain dislike towards you his
   brother who avenged his death? Should I remember his crime, and forget
   that kindness of yours which you vouchsafed to assure me by letter
   [1315] should remain the same towards me after your brother's death of
   happy memory, as it had been during his lifetime? How could I have
   borne to look upon the murderer? Must I not have thought that the
   blessed Prince beheld me, when I prayed for your safety? For brothers
   are by nature mirrors of each other. Wherefore as seeing you in him, I
   never should have slandered you before him; and as seeing him in you,
   never should I have written to his enemy, instead of praying for your
   safety. Of this my witnesses are, first of all, the Lord who has heard
   and has given to you entire the kingdom of your forefathers: and next
   those persons who were present at the time, Felicissimus, who was Duke
   of Egypt, Rufinus, and Stephanus, the former of whom was
   Receiver-general, the latter, Master there; Count Asterius, and
   Palladius Master of the palace, Antiochus and Evagrius Official Agents
   [1316] . I had only to say, Let us pray for the safety of the most
   religious Emperor, Constantius Augustus,' and all the people
   immediately cried out with one voice, O Christ send help to
   Constantius;' and they continued praying thus for some time [1317] .

   the Provincial QuÃ¦stors in the early times of the Empire. They were in
   the department of the Comes Sacrarum Largitionum, or High Treasurer of
   the Revenue (Gothofr. Cod. Theod. t. 6. p. 327). Both Gothofr. however
   and Pancirolus, p. 134. Ed. 1623, place Rationales also under the Comes
   Rerum Privatarum. Pancirolus, p. 120. mentions the Comes Rationalis

   11. Challenge to the accusers as to the alleged letter.

   Now I have already called upon God, and His Word, the Only-begotten Son
   our Lord Jesus Christ, to witness for me, that I have never written to
   that man, nor received letters from him. And as to my accuser, give me
   leave to ask him a few short questions concerning this charge also. How
   did he come to the knowledge of this matter? Will he say that he has
   got copies of the letter? for this is what the Arians laboured to
   prove. Now in the first place, even if he can shew writing resembling
   mine, the thing is not yet certain; for there are forgers, who have
   often imitated the hand [1318] even of you who are Emperors. And the
   resemblance will not prove the genuineness of the letter, unless my
   customary amanuensis shall testify in its favour. I would then again
   ask my accusers, Who provided you with these copies? and whence were
   they obtained? I had my writers [1319] , and he his servants, who
   received his letters from the bearers, and gave them into his hand. My
   assistants are forthcoming; vouchsafe to summon the others (for they
   are most probably still living), and enquire concerning these letters.
   Search into the matter, as though Truth were the partner of your
   throne. She is the defence of Kings, and especially of Christian Kings;
   with her you will reign most securely, for holy Scripture says, Mercy
   and truth preserve the king, and they will encircle his throne in
   righteousness [1320] .' And the wise Zorobabel gained a victory over
   the others by setting forth the power of Truth, and all the people
   cried out, Great is the truth, and mighty above all things [1321] .'

   12. Truth the defence of Thrones.

   Had I been accused before any other, I should have appealed to your
   Piety; as once the Apostle appealed unto CÃ¦sar, and put an end to the
   designs of his enemies against him. But since they have had the
   boldness to lay their charge before you, to whom shall I appeal from
   you? to the Father of Him who says, I am the Truth [1322] ,' that He
   may incline your heart into clemency:--

   O Lord Almighty, and King of eternity, the Father of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, who by Thy Word hast given this Kingdom to Thy servant
   Constantius; do Thou shine into his heart, that he, knowing the
   falsehood that is set against me, may both favourably receive this my
   defence; and may make known unto all men, that his ears are firmly set
   to hearken unto the Truth, according as it is written, Righteous lips
   alone are acceptable unto the King [1323] .' For Thou hast caused it to
   be said by Solomon, that thus the throne of the kingdom shall be
   established.

   Wherefore at least enquire into this matter, and let the accusers
   understand that your desire is to learn the truth; and see, whether
   they will not shew their falsehood by their very looks; for the
   countenance is a test of the conscience as it is written, A merry heart
   maketh a cheerful countenance, but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is
   broken [1324] .' Thus they who had conspired against Joseph [1325] were
   convicted by their own consciences; and the craft of Laban towards
   Jacob was shewn in his countenance [1326] . And thus you see the
   suspicious alarm of these persons, for they fly and hide themselves;
   but on our part frankness in making our defence. And the question
   between us is not one regarding worldly wealth, but concerning the
   honour of the Church. He that has been struck by a stone, applies to a
   physician; but sharper than a stone are the strokes of calumny; for as
   Solomon has said, A false witness is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp
   arrow [1327] ,' and its wounds Truth alone is able to cure; and if
   Truth be set at nought, they grow worse and worse.

   13. This charge rests on forgery.

   It is this that has thrown the Churches everywhere into such confusion;
   for pretences have been devised, and Bishops of great authority, and of
   advanced age [1328] , have been banished for holding communion with me.
   And if matters had stopped here, our prospect would be favourable
   through your gracious interposition. But that the evil may not extend
   itself, let Truth prevail before you; and leave not every Church under
   suspicion, as though Christian men, nay even Bishops, could be guilty
   of plotting and writing in this manner. Or if you are unwilling to
   investigate the matter, it is but right that we who offer our defence,
   should be believed, rather than our calumniators. They, like enemies,
   are occupied in wickedness; we, as earnestly contending for our cause,
   present to you our proofs. And truly I wonder how it comes to pass,
   that while we address you with fear and reverence, they are possessed
   of such an impudent spirit, that they dare even to lie before the
   Emperor. But I pray you, for the Truth's sake, and as it is written
   [1329] , search diligently' in my presence, on what grounds they affirm
   these things, and whence these letters were obtained. But neither will
   any of my servants be proved guilty, nor will any of his people be able
   to tell whence they came; for they are forgeries. And perhaps one had
   better not enquire further. They do not wish it, lest the writer of the
   letters should be certain of detection. For the calumniators alone, and
   none besides, know who he is.

   14. The third charge, of using an undedicated Church.

   But forasmuch as they have informed against me in the matter of the
   great Church [1330] , that a communion was holden there before it was
   completed, I will answer to your Piety on this charge also; for the
   parties who are hostile towards me constrain me to do so. I confess
   this did so happen; for, as in what I have hitherto said, I have spoken
   no lie, I will not now deny this. But the facts are far otherwise than
   they have represented them. Suffer me to declare to you, most religious
   Augustus, that we kept no day of dedication (it would certainly have
   been unlawful to do so, before receiving orders from you), nor were we
   led to act as we did through premeditation. No Bishop or other
   Clergyman was invited to join in our proceedings; for much was yet
   wanting to complete the building. Nay the congregation was not held on
   a previous notice, which might give them a reason for informing against
   us. Every one knows how it happened; hear me, however, with your
   accustomed equity and patience. It was the feast of Easter [1331] , and
   the multitude assembled together was exceeding great, such as Christian
   kings would desire to see in all their cities. Now when the Churches
   were found to be too few to contain them, there was no little stir
   among the people, who desired that they might be allowed to meet
   together in the great Church, where they could all offer up their
   prayers for your safety. And this they did; for although I exhorted
   them to wait awhile, and to hold service in the other Churches, with
   whatever inconvenience to themselves, they would not listen to me; but
   were ready to go out of the city, and meet in desert places in the open
   air, thinking it better to endure the fatigue of the journey, than to
   keep the feast in such a state of discomfort.

   [1331] a.d. 355.
     __________________________________________________________________

   15. Want of room the cause, precedent the justification.

   Believe me, Sire, and let Truth be my witness in this also, when I
   declare that in the congregations held during the season of Lent, in
   consequence of the narrow limits of the places, and the vast multitude
   of people assembled, a great number of children, not a few of the
   younger and very many of the older women, besides several young men,
   suffered so much from the pressure of the crowd, that they were obliged
   to be carried home; though by the Providence of God, no one is dead.
   All however murmured, and demanded the use of the great Church. And if
   the pressure was so great during the days which preceded the feast,
   what would have been the case during the feast itself? Of course
   matters would have been far worse. It did not therefore become me to
   change the people's joy into grief, their cheerfulness into sorrow, and
   to make the festival a season of lamentation.

   And that the more, because I had a precedent in the conduct of our
   Fathers. For the blessed Alexander, when the other places were too
   small, and he was engaged in the erection of what was then considered a
   very large one, the Church of Theonas [1332] , held his congregations
   there on account of the number of the people, while at the same time he
   proceeded with the building. I have seen the same thing done at Treveri
   and at Aquileia, in both which places, while the building was
   proceeding, they assembled there during the feasts, on account of the
   number of the people and they never found any one to accuse them in
   this manner. Nay, your brother of blessed memory was present, when a
   communion was held under these circumstances at Aquileia. I also
   followed this course. There was no dedication, but only a service of
   prayer. You, at least I am sure, as a lover of God will approve of the
   people's zeal, and will pardon me for being unwilling to hinder the
   prayers of so great a multitude.

   16. Better to pray together than separately.

   But here again I would ask my accuser, where was it right that the
   people should pray? in the deserts, or in a place which was in course
   of building for the purpose of prayer? Where was it becoming and pious
   that the people should answer, Amen [1333] ? in the deserts, or in what
   was already called the Lord's house? Where would you, most religious
   Prince, have wished your people to stretch forth their hands, and to
   pray for you? Where Greeks, as they passed by, might stop and listen,
   or in a place named after yourself, which all men have long called the
   Lord's house, even since the foundations of it were laid? I am sure
   that you prefer your own place; for you smile, and that tells me so.
   But,' says the accuser, it ought to have been in the Churches. They
   were all, as I said before, too small and confined to admit the
   multitude. Then again, in which way was it most becoming that their
   prayers should be made? Should they meet together in parts and separate
   companies, with danger from the crowded state of the congregation? or,
   when there was now a place that would contain them all, should they
   assemble in it, and speak as with one and the same voice in perfect
   harmony? This was the better course, for this shewed the unanimity of
   the multitude: in this way God will readily hear prayer. For if,
   according to the promise of our Saviour Himself [1334] , where two
   shall agree together as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall
   be done for them, how shall it be when so great an assembly of people
   with one voice utter their Amen to God? Who indeed was there that did
   not marvel at the sight? Who but pronounced you happy when they saw so
   great a multitude met together in one place? How did the people
   themselves rejoice to see each other, having been accustomed heretofore
   to assemble in separate places! The circumstance was a source of
   pleasure to all; of vexation to the calumniator alone.

   17. Better to pray in a building than in the desert.

   Now then, I would also meet the other and only remaining objection of
   my accuser. He says, the building was not completed, and prayer ought
   not to have been made there. But the Lord said, But thou, when thou
   prayest, enter into thy closet, and shut the door [1335] .' What then
   will the accuser answer? or rather what will all prudent and true
   Christians say? Let your Majesty ask the opinion of such: for it is
   written of the other, The foolish person will speak foolishness [1336]
   ;' but of these, Ask counsel of all that are wise [1337] .' When the
   Churches were too small, and the people so numerous as they were, and
   desirous to go forth into the deserts, what ought I to have done? The
   desert has no doors, and all who choose may pass through it, but the
   Lord's house is enclosed with walls and doors, and marks the difference
   between the pious and the profane. Will not every wise person then, as
   well as your Piety, Sire, give the preference to the latter place? For
   they know that here prayer is lawfully offered, while a suspicion of
   irregularity attaches to it there. Unless indeed no place proper for it
   existed, and the worshippers dwelt only in the desert, as was the case
   with Israel; although after the tabernacle was built, they also had
   thenceforth a place set apart for prayer. O Christ, Lord and true King
   of kings, Only-begotten Son of God, Word and Wisdom of the Father, I am
   accused because the people prayed Thy gracious favour, and through Thee
   besought Thy Father, who is God over all, to save Thy servant, the most
   religious Constantius. But thanks be to Thy goodness, that it is for
   this that I am blamed, and for the keeping of Thy laws. Heavier had
   been the blame, and more true had been the charge, had we passed by the
   place which the Emperor was building, and gone forth into the desert to
   pray. How would the accuser then have vented his folly! With what
   apparent reason would he have said, He despised the place which you are
   building; he does not approve of your undertaking; he passed it by in
   derision; he pointed to the desert to supply the want of room; he
   prevented the people when they wished to offer up their prayers.' This
   is what he wished to say, and sought an occasion of saying it; and
   finding none he is vexed, and so forthwith invents a charge against me.
   Had he been able to say this, he would have confounded me with shame;
   as now he injures me, copying the accuser's ways, and watching for an
   occasion against those that pray. Thus has he perverted to a wicked
   purpose his knowledge of Daniel's [1338] history. But he has been
   deceived; for he ignorantly imagined, that Babylonian practices were in
   fashion with you, and knew not that you are a friend of the blessed
   Daniel, and worship the same God, and do not forbid, but wish all men
   to pray, knowing that the prayer of all is, that you may continue to
   reign in perpetual peace and safety.

   18. Prayers first do not interfere with dedication afterwards.

   This is what I have to complain of on the part of my accuser. But may
   you, most religious Augustus, live through the course of many years to
   come, and celebrate the dedication of the Church. Surely the prayers
   which have been offered for your safety by all men, are no hindrance to
   this celebration. Let these unlearned persons cease such
   misrepresentations, but let them learn from the example of the Fathers;
   and let them read the Scriptures. Or rather let them learn of you, who
   are so well instructed in such histories, how that Joshua the son of
   Josedek the priest, and his brethren, and Zorobabel the wise, the son
   of Salathiel, and Ezra the priest and scribe of the law, when the
   temple was in course of building after the captivity, the feast of
   tabernacles being at hand (which was a great feast and time of assembly
   and prayer in Israel), gathered [1339] the people together with one
   accord in the great court within the first gate, which is toward the
   East, and prepared the altar to God, and there offered their gifts, and
   kept the feast. And so afterwards they brought hither their sacrifices,
   on the sabbaths and the new moons, and the people offered up their
   prayers. And yet the Scripture says expressly, that when these things
   were done, the temple of God was not yet built; but rather while they
   thus prayed, the building of the house was advancing. So that neither
   were their prayers deferred in expectation of the dedication, nor was
   the dedication prevented by the assemblies held for the sake of prayer.
   But the people thus continued to pray; and when the house was entirely
   finished, they celebrated the dedication, and brought their gifts for
   that purpose, and all kept the feast for the completion of the work.
   And thus also have the blessed Alexander, and the other Fathers done.
   They continued to assemble their people, and when they had completed
   the work they gave thanks unto the Lord, and celebrated the dedication.
   This also it befits you to do, O Prince, most careful in your
   inquiries. The place is ready, having been already sanctified by the
   prayers which have been offered in it, and requires only the presence
   of your Piety. This only is wanting to its perfect beauty. Do you then
   supply this deficiency, and there make your prayers unto the Lord, for
   whom you have built this house. That you may do so is the prayer of all
   men.

   19. Fourth charge, of having disobeyed an Imperial order.

   And now, if it please you, let us consider the remaining accusation,
   and permit me to answer it likewise. They have dared to charge me with
   resisting your commands, and refusing to leave my Church. Truly I
   wonder they are not weary of uttering their calumnies; I however am not
   yet weary of answering them, I rather rejoice to do so; for the more
   abundant my defence is, the more entirely must they be condemned. I did
   not resist the commands of your Piety, God forbid; I am not a man that
   would resist even the QuÃ¦stor [1340] of the city, much less so great a
   Prince. On this matter I need not many words, for the whole city will
   bear witness for me. Nevertheless, permit me again to relate the
   circumstances from the beginning; for when you hear them, I am sure you
   will be astonished at the presumption of my enemies. Montanus, the
   officer of the Palace [1341] , came and brought me a letter, which
   purported to be an answer to one from me, requesting that I might go
   into Italy, for the purpose of obtaining a supply of the deficiencies
   which I thought existed in the condition of our Churches. Now I desire
   to thank your Piety, which condescended to assent to my request, on the
   supposition that I had written to you, and has made provision [1342]
   for me to undertake the journey, and to accomplish it without trouble.
   But here again I am astonished at those who have spoken falsehood in
   your ears, that they were not afraid, seeing that lying belongs to the
   Devil, and that liars are alien from Him who says, I am the Truth
   [1343] .' For I never wrote to you, nor will my accuser be able to find
   any such letter; and though I ought to have written every day, if I
   might thereby behold your gracious countenance, yet it would neither
   have been pious to desert the Churches, nor right to be troublesome to
   your Piety, especially since you are willing to grant our requests in
   behalf of the Church, although we are not present to make them. Now may
   it please you to order me to read what Montanus commanded me to do.
   This is as follows [1344] .***

   20. History of his disobeying it.

   Now I ask again, whence have my accusers obtained this letter also? I
   would learn of them who it was that put it into their hands? Do you
   cause them to answer. By this you may perceive that they have forged
   this, as they spread abroad also the former letter, which they
   published against me, with reference to the ill-named Magnentius. And
   being convicted in this instance also, on what pretence next will they
   bring me to make my defence? Their only concern is, to throw everything
   into disorder and confusion; and for this end I perceive they exercise
   their zeal. Perhaps they think that by frequent repetition of their
   charges, they will at last exasperate you against me. But you ought to
   turn away from such persons, and to hate them; for such as themselves
   are, such also they imagine those to be who listen to them; and they
   think that their calumnies will prevail even before you. The accusation
   of Doeg [1345] prevailed of old against the priests of God: but it was
   the unrighteous Saul, who hearkened unto him. And Jezebel was able to
   injure the most religious Naboth [1346] by her false accusations; but
   then it was the wicked and apostate Ahab who hearkened unto her. But
   the most holy David, whose example it becomes you to follow, as all
   pray that you may, favours not such men, but was wont to turn away from
   them and avoid them, as raging dogs. He says, Whoso privily slandereth
   his neighbour, him will I destroy [1347] .' For he kept the commandment
   which says, Thou shalt not receive a false report [1348] .' And false
   are the reports of these men in your sight. You, like Solomon, have
   required of the Lord (and you ought to believe yourself to have
   obtained your desire), that it would seem good unto Him to remove far
   from you vain and lying words [1349] .

   21. Forasmuch then as the letter owed its origin to a false story, and
   contained no order that I should come to you, I concluded that it was
   not the wish of your Piety that I should come. For in that you gave me
   no absolute command, but merely wrote as in answer to a letter from me,
   requesting that I might be permitted to set in order the things which
   seemed to be wanting, it was manifest to me (although no one told me
   this) that the letter which I had received did not express the
   sentiments of your Clemency. All knew, and I also stated in writing, as
   Montanus is aware, that I did not refuse to come, but only that I
   thought it unbecoming to take advantage of the supposition that I had
   written to you to request this favour, fearing also lest the false
   accusers should find in this a pretence for saying that I made myself
   troublesome to your Piety. Nevertheless, I made preparations, as
   Montanus also knows, in order that, should you condescend to write to
   me, I might immediately leave home, and readily answer your commands;
   for I was not so mad as to resist such an order from you. When then in
   fact your Piety did not write to me, how could I resist a command which
   I never received? or how can they say that I refused to obey, when no
   orders were given me? Is not this again the mere fabrication of
   enemies, pretending that which never took place? I fear that even now,
   while I am engaged in this defence of myself, they may allege against
   me that I am doing that which I have never obtained your permission to
   do. So easily is my conduct made matter of accusation by them, and so
   ready are they to vent their calumnies in despite of that Scripture,
   which says, Love not to slander another, lest thou be cut off [1350] .'

   22. Arrivals of Diogenes and of Syrianus.

   After a period of six and twenty months, when Montanus had gone away,
   there came Diogenes the Notary [1351] ; but he brought me no letter,
   nor did we see each other, nor did he charge me with any commands as
   from you. Moreover when the General Syrianus entered Alexandria [1352]
   , seeing that certain reports were spread abroad by the Arians, who
   declared that matters would now be as they wished, I enquired whether
   he had brought any letters on the subject of these statements of
   theirs. I confess that I asked for letters containing your commands.
   And when he said that he had brought none, I requested that Syrianus
   himself, or Maximus the Prefect of Egypt, would write to me concerning
   this matter. Which request I made, because your Grace has written to
   me, desiring that I would not suffer myself to be alarmed by any one,
   nor attend to those who wished to frighten me, but that I would
   continue to reside in the Churches without fear. It was Palladius, the
   Master of the Palace, and Asterius, formerly Duke of Armenia, who
   brought me this letter. Permit me to read a copy of it. It is as
   follows:

   23. A copy [1353] of the letter as follows:

   Constantius Victor Augustus to Athanasius [1354] . It is not unknown to
   your Prudence, how constantly I prayed that success might attend my
   late brother Constans in all his undertakings, and your wisdom will
   easily judge how greatly I was afflicted, when I learnt that he had
   been cut off by the treachery of villains. Now forasmuch as certain
   persons are endeavouring at this time to alarm you, by setting before
   your eyes that lamentable tragedy, I have thought good to address to
   your Reverence this present letter, to exhort you, that, as becomes a
   Bishop, you would teach the people to conform to the established [1355]
   religion, and, according to your custom, give yourself up to prayer
   together with them. For this is agreeable to our wishes; and our desire
   is, that you should at every season be a Bishop in your own place.

   And in another hand:--May divine Providence preserve you, beloved
   Father, many years.

   24. Why Athanasius did not obey the Imperial Order.

   On the subject of this letter, my opponents conferred with the
   magistrates. And was it not reasonable that I, having received it,
   should demand their letters, and refuse to give heed to mere pretences?
   And were they not acting in direct contradiction to the tenor of your
   instructions to me, while they failed to shew me the commands of your
   Piety? I therefore, seeing they produced no letters from you,
   considered it improbable that a mere verbal communication should be
   made to them, especially as the letter of your Grace had charged me not
   to give ear to such persons. I acted rightly then, most religious
   Augustus, that as I had returned to my country under the authority of
   your letters, so I should only leave it by your command; and might not
   render myself liable hereafter to a charge of having deserted the
   Church, but as receiving your order might have a reason for my
   retiring. This was demanded for me by all my people, who went to
   Syrianus together with the Presbyters, and the greatest part, to say
   the least, of the city with them. Maximus, the Prefect of Egypt, was
   also there: and their request was that either he would send me a
   declaration of your wishes in writing, or would forbear to disturb the
   Churches, while the people themselves were sending a deputation to you
   respecting the matter. When they persisted in their demand, Syrianus at
   last perceived the reasonableness of it, and consented, protesting by
   your safety (Hilary was present and witnessed this) that he would put
   an end to the disturbance, and refer the case to your Piety. The guards
   of the Duke, as well as those of the Prefect of Egypt, know that this
   is true; the Prytanis [1356] of the city also remembers the words; so
   that you will perceive that neither I, nor any one else, resisted your
   commands.

   25. The irruption of Syrianus.

   All demanded that the letters of your Piety should be exhibited. For
   although the bare word of a King is of equal weight and authority with
   his written command, especially if he who reports it, boldly affirms in
   writing that it has been given him; yet when they neither openly
   declared that they had received any command, nor, as they were
   requested to do, gave me assurance of it in writing, but acted
   altogether as by their own authority; I confess, I say it boldly, I was
   suspicious of them. For there were many Arians about them, who were
   their companions at table, and their counsellors; and while they
   attempted nothing openly, they were preparing to assail me by stratagem
   and treachery. Nor did they act at all as under the authority of a
   royal command, but, as their conduct betrayed, at the solicitation of
   enemies. This made me demand more urgently that they should produce
   letters from you, seeing that all their undertakings and designs were
   of a suspicious nature; and because it was unseemly that after I had
   entered the Church, under the authority of so many letters from you, I
   should retire from it without such a sanction. When however Syrianus
   gave his promise, all the people assembled together in the Churches
   with feelings of joyfulness and security. But three and twenty days
   after [1357] , he burst into the Church with his soldiers, while we
   were engaged in our usual services, as those who entered in there
   witnessed; for it was a vigil, preparatory to a communion on the
   morrow. And such things were done that night as the Arians desired and
   had beforehand denounced against us. For the General brought them with
   him; and they were the instigators and advisers of the attack. This is
   no incredible story of mine, most religious Augustus; for it was not
   done in secret, but was noised abroad everywhere. When therefore I saw
   the assault begun, I first exhorted the people to retire, and then
   withdrew myself after them, God hiding and guiding me, as those who
   were with me at the time witness. Since then, I have remained by
   myself, though I have all confidence to answer for my conduct, in the
   first place before God, and also before your Piety, for that I did not
   flee and desert my people, but can point to the attack of the General
   upon us, as a proof of persecution. His proceedings have caused the
   greatest astonishment among all men; for either he ought not to have
   made a promise, or not to have broken it after he had made it.

   26. How Athanasius acted when this took place.

   Now why did they form this plot against me, and treacherously lay an
   ambush to take me, when it was in their power to enforce the order by a
   written declaration? The command of an Emperor is wont to give great
   boldness to those entrusted with it; but their desire to act secretly
   made the suspicion stronger that they had received no command. And did
   I require anything so very absurd? Let your Majesty's candour decide.
   Will not every one say, that such a demand was reasonable for a Bishop
   to make? You know, for you have read the Scriptures, how great an
   offence it is for a Bishop to desert his Church, and to neglect the
   flocks of God. For the absence of the Shepherd gives the wolves an
   opportunity to attack the sheep. And this was what the Arians and all
   the other heretics desired, that during my absence they might find an
   opportunity to entrap the people into impiety. If then I had fled, what
   defence could I have made before the true Bishops? or rather before Him
   Who has committed to me His flock? He it is Who judges the whole earth,
   the true King of all, our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Would not
   every one have rightly charged me with neglect of my people? Would not
   your Piety have blamed me, and have justly asked, After you had
   returned under the authority of our letters, why did you withdraw
   without such authority, and desert your people?' Would not the people
   themselves at the day of judgment have reasonably imputed to me this
   neglect of them, and have said, He that had the oversight of us fled,
   and we were neglected, there being no one to put us in mind of our
   duty?' When they said this, what could I have answered? Such a
   complaint was made by Ezekiel against the Pastors of old [1358] ; and
   the blessed Apostle Paul, knowing this, has charged every one of us
   through his disciple, saying, Neglect not the gift that is in thee,
   which was given thee, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery
   [1359] .' Fearing this, I wished not to flee, but to receive your
   commands, if indeed such was the will of your Piety. But I never
   obtained what I so reasonably requested, and now I am falsely accused
   before you; for I resisted no commands of your Piety; nor will I now
   attempt to return to Alexandria, until your Grace shall desire it. This
   I say beforehand, lest the slanderers should again make this a pretence
   for accusing me.

   27. Athanasius leaves Alexandria to go to Constantius, but is stopped
   by the news of the banishment of the Bishops.

   Observing these things, I did not give sentence against myself, but
   hastened to come to your Piety, with this my defence, knowing your
   goodness, and remembering your faithful promises, and being confident
   that, as it is written in the divine Proverbs, Just speeches are
   acceptable to a gracious king [1360] .' But when I had already entered
   upon my journey, and had passed through the desert [1361] , a report
   suddenly reached me [1362] , which at first I thought to be incredible,
   but which afterwards proved to be true. It was rumoured everywhere that
   Liberius, Bishop of Rome, the great Hosius of Spain, Paulinus of Gaul,
   Dionysius and Eusebius of Italy, Lucifer of Sardinia, and certain other
   Bishops and Presbyters and Deacons, had been banished [1363] because
   they refused to subscribe to my condemnation. These had been banished:
   and Vincentius of Capua, Fortunatian of Aquileia, Heremius of
   Thessalonica, and all the Bishops of the West, were treated with no
   ordinary force, nay were suffering extreme violence and grievous
   injuries, until they could be induced to promise that they would not
   communicate with me. While I was astonished and perplexed at these
   tidings, behold another report [1364] overtook me, respecting them of
   Egypt and Libya, that nearly ninety Bishops had been under persecution,
   and that their Churches were given up to the professors of Arianism;
   that sixteen had been banished, and of the rest, some had fled, and
   others were constrained to dissemble. For the persecution was said to
   be so violent in those parts, that at Alexandria, while the brethren
   were praying during Easter and on the Lord's days in a desert place
   near the cemetery, the General came upon them with a force of soldiery,
   more than three thousand in number, with arms, drawn swords, and
   spears; whereupon outrages, such as might be expected to follow so
   unprovoked an attack, were committed against women and children, who
   were doing nothing more than praying to God. It would perhaps be
   unseasonable to give an account of them now, lest the mere mention of
   such enormities should move us all to tears. But such was their
   cruelty, that virgins were stripped, and even the bodies of those who
   died from the blows they received were not immediately given up for
   burial, but were cast out to the dogs, until their relatives, with
   great risk to themselves, came secretly and stole them away, and much
   effort was necessary, that no one might know it.

   28. The news of the intrusion of George.

   The rest of their proceedings will perhaps be thought incredible, and
   will fill all men with astonishment, by reason of their extreme
   atrocity. It is necessary however to speak of them, in order that your
   Christian zeal and piety may perceive that their slanders and calumnies
   against us are framed for no other end, than that they may drive us out
   of the Churches, and introduce their own impiety in our place. For when
   the lawful Bishops, men of advanced age, had some of them been
   banished, and others forced to fly, heathens and catechumens, those who
   hold the first places in the senate and men who are notorious for their
   wealth, were straightway commissioned by the Arians to preach the holy
   faith instead of Christians [1365] . And enquiry was no longer made, as
   the Apostle enjoined, if any be blameless [1366] :' but according to
   the practice of the impious Jeroboam, he who could give most money was
   named Bishop; and it made no difference to them, even if the man
   happened to be a heathen, so long as he furnished them with money.
   Those who had been Bishops from the time of Alexander, monks and
   ascetics, were banished: and men practised only in calumny corrupted,
   as far as in them lay, the Apostolic rule, and polluted the Churches.
   Truly their false accusations against us have gained them much, that
   they should be able to commit iniquity, and to do such things as these
   in your time; so that the words of Scripture may be applied to them,
   Woe unto those through whom My name is blasphemed among the Gentiles
   [1367] .'

   29. Athanasius has heard of his own proscription.

   Such were the rumours that were noised abroad; and although everything
   was thus turned upside down, I still did not relinquish my earnest
   desire of coming to your Piety, but was again setting forward on my
   journey. And I did so the more eagerly, being confident that these
   proceedings were contrary to your wishes, and that if your Grace should
   be informed of what was done, you would prevent it for the time to
   come. For I could not think that a righteous king could wish Bishops to
   be banished, and virgins to be stripped, or the Churches to be in any
   way disturbed. While I thus reasoned and hastened on my journey, behold
   a third report reached me, to the effect that letters had been written
   to the Princes of Auxumis, desiring that Frumentius [1368] , Bishop of
   Auxumis, should be brought from thence, and that search should be made
   for me even as far as the country of the Barbarians, that I might be
   handed over to the Commentaries [1369] (as they are called) of the
   Prefects, and that all the laity and clergy should be compelled to
   communicate with the Arian heresy, and that such as would not comply
   with this order should be put to death. To shew that these were not
   merely idle rumours, but that they were confirmed by facts, since your
   Grace has given me leave, I produce the letter. My enemies were
   constantly reading it, and threatening each one with death.

   30. A copy of the letter of Constantius against Athanasius.

   Victor Constantius Maximus Augustus to the Alexandrians.

   Your city, preserving its national character, and remembering the
   virtue of its founders, has habitually shewn itself obedient unto us,
   as it does at this day; and we on our part should consider ourselves
   greatly wanting in our duty, did not our good will eclipse even that of
   Alexander himself. For as it belongs to a temperate mind, to behave
   itself orderly in all respects, so it is the part of royalty, on
   account of virtue, permit me to say, such as yours, to embrace you
   above all others; you, who rose up as the first teachers of wisdom who
   were the first to acknowledge [1370] God; who moreover have chosen for
   yourselves the most consummate masters; and have cordially acquiesced
   in our opinion, justly abominating that impostor and cheat, and
   dutifully uniting yourselves to those venerable men who are beyond all
   admiration. And yet, who is ignorant, even among those who live in the
   ends of the earth, what violent party spirit was displayed in the late
   proceedings? with which we know not anything that has ever happened,
   worthy to be compared. The majority of the citizens had their eyes
   blinded, and a man who had come forth from the lowest dens of infamy
   obtained authority among them, entrapping into falsehood, as under
   cover of darkness, those who were desirous to know the truth;--one who
   never provided for them any fruitful and edifying discourse, but
   corrupted their minds with unprofitable subtleties. His flatterers
   shouted and applauded him; they were astonished at his powers, and they
   still probably murmur secretly; while the majority of the more simple
   sort took their cue from them. And thus all went with the stream, as if
   a flood had broken in, while everything was entirely neglected. One of
   the multitude was in power;--how can I describe him more truly than by
   saying, that he was superior in nothing to the meanest of the people,
   and that the only kindness which he shewed to the city was, that he did
   not thrust her citizens down into the pit. This noble-minded and
   illustrious person did not wait for judgment to proceed against him,
   but sentenced himself to banishment, as he deserved. So that now it is
   for the interest of the Barbarians to remove him out of the way, lest
   he lead some of them into impiety, for he will make his complaint, like
   distressed characters in a play, to those who first fall in with him.
   To him however we will now bid a long farewell. For yourselves there
   are few with whom I can compare you: I am bound rather to honour you
   separately above all others, for the great virtue and wisdom which your
   actions, that are celebrated almost through the whole world, proclaim
   you to possess. Go on in this sober course. I would gladly have
   repeated to me a description of your conduct in such terms of praise as
   it deserves; O you who have eclipsed your predecessors in the race of
   glory, and will be a noble example both to those who are now alive, and
   to all who shall come after, and alone have chosen for yourselves the
   most perfect of beings as guide for your conduct, both in word and
   deed, and hesitated not a moment, but manfully transferred your
   affections, and gave yourselves up to the other side, leaving those
   grovelling [1371] and earthly teachers, and stretching forth towards
   heavenly things, under the guidance of the most venerable George [1372]
   , than whom no man is more perfectly instructed therein. Under him you
   will continue to have a good hope respecting the future life, and will
   pass your time in this present world, in rest and quietness. Would that
   all the citizens together would lay hold on his words, as a sacred
   anchor, so that we might need neither knife nor cautery for those whose
   souls are diseased! Such persons we most earnestly advise to renounce
   their zeal in favour of Athanasius, and not even to remember the
   foolish things which he spoke so plentifully among them. Otherwise they
   will bring themselves before they are aware into extreme peril, from
   which we know not any one who will be skilful enough to deliver such
   factious persons. For while that pestilent fellow Athanasius is driven
   from place to place, being convicted of the basest crimes, for which he
   would only suffer the punishment he deserves, if one were to kill him
   ten times over, it would be inconsistent in us to suffer those
   flatterers and juggling ministers of his to exult against us; men of
   such a character as it is a shame even to speak of, respecting whom
   orders have long ago been given to the magistrates, that they should be
   put to death. But even now perhaps they shall not die, if they desist
   from their former offences, and repent at last. For that most pestilent
   fellow Athanasius led them on, and corrupted the whole state, and laid
   his impious and polluted hands upon the most holy things.

   31. Letter of Constantius to the Ethiopians against Frumentius.

   The following is the letter which was written to the Princes of Auxumis
   respecting Frumentius, Bishop of that place.

   Constantius Victor Maximus Augustus, to Ã†zanes and Sazanes.

   It is altogether a matter of the greatest care and concern to us, to
   extend the knowledge of the supreme God [1373] ; and I think that the
   whole race of mankind claims from us equal regard in this respect, in
   order that they may pass their lives in hope, being brought to a proper
   knowledge of God, and having no differences with each other in their
   enquiries concerning justice and truth. Wherefore considering that you
   are deserving of the same provident care as the Romans, and desiring to
   shew equal regard for your welfare, we command that the same doctrine
   be professed in your Churches as in theirs. Send therefore speedily
   into Egypt the Bishop Frumentius to the most venerable Bishop George,
   and the rest who are there, who have especial authority to appoint to
   these offices, and to decide questions concerning them. For of course
   you know and remember (unless you alone pretend to be ignorant of that
   which all men are well aware of) that this Frumentius was advanced to
   his present rank by Athanasius, a man who is guilty of ten thousand
   crimes; for he has not been able fairly to clear himself of any of the
   charges brought against him, but was at once deprived of his see, and
   now wanders about destitute of any fixed abode, and passes from one
   country to another, as if by this means he could escape his own
   wickedness. Now if Frumentius shall readily obey our commands, and
   shall submit to an enquiry into all the circumstances of his
   appointment, he will shew plainly to all men, that he is in no respect
   opposed to the laws of the Church and the established [1374] faith. And
   being brought to trial, when he shall have given proof of his general
   good conduct, and submitted an account of his life to those who are to
   judge of these things, he shall receive his appointment from them, if
   it shall indeed appear that he has any right to be a Bishop. But if he
   shall delay and avoid the trial, it will surely be very evident, that
   he has been induced by the persuasions of the wicked Athanasius, thus
   to indulge impiety against God, choosing to follow the course of him
   whose wickedness has been made manifest. And our fear is lest he should
   pass over into Auxumis and corrupt your people, by setting before them
   accursed and impious statements, and not only unsettle and disturb the
   Churches, and blaspheme the supreme God, but also thereby cause utter
   overthrow and destruction to the several nations whom he visits. But I
   am sure that Frumentius will return home, perfectly acquainted with all
   matters that concern the Church, having derived much instruction, which
   will be of great and general utility, from the conversation of the most
   venerable George, and such other of the Bishops, as are excellently
   qualified to communicate such knowledge. May God continually preserve
   you, most honoured brethren.

   32. He defends his Flight.

   Hearing, nay almost seeing, these things, through the mournful
   representations of the messengers, I confess I turned back again into
   the desert, justly concluding, as your Piety will perceive, that if I
   was sought after, that I might be sent as soon as I was discovered to
   the Prefects [1375] , I should be prevented from ever coming to your
   Grace; and that if those who would not subscribe against me, suffered
   so severely as they did, and the laity who refused to communicate with
   the Arians were ordered for death, there was no doubt at all but that
   ten thousand new modes of destruction would be devised by the
   calumniators against me; and that after my death, they would employ
   against whomsoever they wished to injure, whatever means they chose,
   venting their lies against us the more boldly, for that then there
   would no longer be any one left who could expose them. I fled, not
   because I feared your Piety (for I know your long-suffering and
   goodness), but because from what had taken place, I perceived the
   spirit of my enemies, and considered that they would make use of all
   possible means to accomplish my destruction, from fear that they would
   be brought to answer for what they had done contrary to the intentions
   of your Excellency. For observe, your Grace commanded that the Bishops
   should be expelled only out of the cities and the province. But these
   worthy persons presumed to exceed your commands, and banished aged men
   and Bishops venerable for their years into desert and unfrequented and
   frightful places, beyond the boundaries of three provinces [1376] .
   Some of them were sent off from Libya to the great Oasis; others from
   the Thebais to Ammoniaca in Libya [1377] . Neither was it from fear of
   death that I fled; let none of them condemn me as guilty of cowardice;
   but because it is the injunction of our Saviour [1378] that we should
   flee when we are persecuted, and hide ourselves when we are sought
   after, and not expose ourselves to certain dangers, nor by appearing
   before our persecutors inflame still more their rage against us. For to
   give one's self up to one's enemies to be murdered, is the same thing
   as to murder one's self; but to flee, as our Saviour has enjoined, is
   to know our time, and to manifest a real concern for our persecutors,
   lest if they proceed to the shedding of blood, they become guilty of
   the transgression of the law, Thou shalt not kill [1379] .' And yet
   these men by their calumnies against me, earnestly wish that I should
   suffer death. What they have again lately done proves that this is
   their desire and murderous intention. You will be astonished, I am
   sure, Augustus, most beloved of God, when you hear it; it is indeed an
   outrage worthy of amazement. What it is, I pray you briefly to hear.

   33. Conduct of the Arians towards the consecrated Virgins.

   The Son of God, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, having become man
   for our sakes, and having destroyed death, and delivered our race from
   the bondage of corruption [1380] , in addition to all His other
   benefits bestowed this also upon us, that we should possess upon earth,
   in the state of virginity [1381] , a picture of the holiness of Angels.
   Accordingly such as have attained this virtue, the Catholic Church has
   been accustomed to call the brides of Christ. And the heathen who see
   them express their admiration of them as the temples of the Word. For
   indeed this holy and heavenly profession is nowhere [1382] established,
   but only among us Christians, and it is a very strong argument that
   with us is to be found the genuine and true religion. Your most
   religious father Constantine Augustus, of blessed memory, honoured the
   Virgins above all the rest, and your Piety in several letters has given
   them the titles of the honourable and holy women. But now these worthy
   Arians who have slandered me, and by whom conspiracies have been formed
   against most of the Bishops, having obtained the consent and
   cooperation of the magistrates, first stripped them, and then caused
   them to be suspended upon what are called the Hermetaries [1383] , and
   scourged them on the ribs so severely three several times, that not
   even real malefactors have ever suffered the like. Pilate, to gratify
   the Jews of old, pierced one of our Saviour's sides with a spear. These
   men have exceeded the madness of Pilate, for they have scourged not one
   but both His sides; for the limbs of the Virgins are in an especial
   manner the Saviour's own. All men shudder at hearing the bare recital
   of deeds like these. These men alone not only did not fear to strip and
   to scourge those undefiled limbs, which the Virgins had dedicated
   solely to our Saviour Christ; but, what is worse than all, when they
   were reproached by every one for such extreme cruelty, instead of
   manifesting any shame, they pretended that it was commanded by your
   Piety. So utterly presumptuous are they and full of wicked thoughts and
   purposes. Such a deed as this was never heard of in past persecutions
   [1384] : or supposing that it ever occurred before, yet surely it was
   not befitting either that Virginity should suffer such outrage and
   dishonour, in the time of your Majesty, a Christian, or that these men
   should impute to your Piety their own cruelty. Such wickedness belongs
   only to heretics, to blaspheme the Son of God, and to do violence to
   His holy Virgins.

   34. He expostulates with Constantius.

   Now when such enormities as these were again perpetrated by the Arians,
   I surely was not wrong in complying with the direction of Holy
   Scripture, which says, Hide thyself for a little moment, until the
   wrath of the Lord be overpast [1385] .' This was another reason for my
   withdrawing myself, Augustus, most beloved of God; and I refused not,
   either to depart into the desert, or, if need were, to be let down from
   a wall in a basket [1386] . I endured everything, I even dwelt among
   wild beasts, that your favour might return to me, waiting for an
   opportunity to offer to you this my defence, confident as I am that
   they will be condemned, and your goodness manifested unto me. O,
   Augustus, blessed and most beloved of God, what would you have had me
   to do? to come to you while my calumniators were inflamed with rage
   against me, and were seeking to kill me; or, as it is written, to hide
   myself a little, that in the mean time they might be condemned as
   heretics, and your goodness might be manifested unto me? or would you
   have had me, Sire, to appear before your magistrates, in order that
   though you had written merely in the way of threatening, they not
   understanding your intention, but being exasperated against me by the
   Arians, might kill me on the authority of your letters, and on that
   ground ascribe the murder to you? It would neither have been becoming
   in me to surrender, and give myself up that my blood might be shed, nor
   in you, as a Christian King, to have the murder of Christians, and
   those too Bishops, imputed unto you.

   35. It was therefore better for me to hide myself, and to wait for this
   opportunity. Yes, I am sure that from your knowledge of the sacred
   Scriptures you will assent and approve of my conduct in this respect.
   For you will perceive that, now those who exasperated you against us
   have been silenced, your righteous clemency is apparent, and it is
   proved to all men that you never persecuted the Christians at all, but
   that it was they who made the Churches desolate, that they might sow
   the seeds of their own impiety everywhere; on account of which I also,
   had I not fled, should long ago have suffered from their treachery. For
   it is very evident that they who scrupled not to utter such calumnies
   against me, before the great Augustus, and who so violently assailed
   Bishops and Virgins, sought also to compass my death. But thanks be to
   the Lord who has given you the kingdom. All men are confirmed in their
   opinion of your goodness, and of their wickedness, from which I fled at
   the first, that I might now make this appeal unto you, and that you
   might find some one towards whom you may shew kindness. I beseech you,
   therefore, forasmuch as it written, A soft answer turneth away wrath,'
   and righteous thoughts are acceptable unto the King [1387] ;' receive
   this my defence, and restore all the Bishops and the rest of the Clergy
   to their countries and their Churches; so that the wickedness of my
   accusers may be made manifest, and that you, both now and in the day of
   judgment, may have boldness to say to our Lord and Saviour Jesus
   Christ, the King of all, "None of Thine have I lost [1388] ," but these
   are they who designed the ruin of all, while I was grieved for those
   who perished, and for the Virgins who were scourged, and for all other
   things that were committed against the Christians; and I brought back
   them that were banished, and restored them to their own Churches.'

   Introduction to Apologia de Fuga.

   ------------------------

   The date of this Defence of his Flight must be placed early enough to
   fall within the lifetime, or very close to the death (Â§1. n. 1), of
   Leontius of Antioch, and late enough to satisfy the references (Â§6) to
   the events at the end of May 357 (see notes there), and to the lapse of
   Hosius, the exact date of which again depends upon that of the Sirmian
   Council of 357, which, if held the presence of Constantius, must have
   fallen as late as August (Gwatk. Stud. 157, n. 3). Athanasius not only
   refers to the lapse of Hosius, but by the quotation he makes from Gal.
   ii. 5, appears to know of its merely temporary nature (see D.C.B. iii.
   173). How early, then, does the first-named condition compel us to
   place the Defence?' Upon the news of the death of Leontius reaching
   Italy (Soz. iv. 12), Eudoxius obtained the leave of Constantius (who
   was in Italy, April 28 to July 3, 357, and again, Nov. 10 to Dec. 10,
   Gwatk. p. 292), to repair to Antioch. There he got himself elected
   bishop, assembled a council (Acacius and other Homoeans), and wrote a
   synodal letter, expelling from the Antiochene Church those who
   dissented. Some of the latter repaired to Ancyra with a letter from the
   semi-Arian George of Laodicea; at Ancyra, Basil assembled a small
   council (before Easter, April 12, 358, see D.C.B. i. 281, Epiph. HÃ¦r.
   73), which wrote to the Emperor protesting against the proceedings of
   Eudoxius. To gain room for these events, at the very least five months,
   and probably more, must be allowed to elapse between the death of
   Leontius and April 12, 358. Leontius must therefore have died in the
   summer (Gwatk. p. 153, note), or at the very latest in October, 357. We
   cannot, therefore, place the Apology much after this date, for the
   reference to Hosius shews--in addition to many other indications--how
   quickly Athanasius in his hiding-place was informed of current events.

   The Apology was drawn forth by the charge of cowardice circulated
   against him by the Arianising party, especially by the three bishops
   named in Â§1. After a preamble upon the motives of his accusers (1, 2),
   he shews that his own case is but part of a general system (3-5) of
   expatriation directed against orthodox bishops. He then refers to the
   circumstance of the attack upon himself, and dwells at length upon the
   tyranny of George (6, 7) and the banishment of Egyptian and Libyan
   bishops. This brings him to the argument (8-22) which gives its name to
   the tract. After pressing the point that if flight be evil, those who
   persecute are the responsible cause (8, 9), and hinting at the real
   motive of their mortification at his escape (10), he defends his flight
   by the example first (10, 11) of the Scripture Saints, secondly of the
   Lord Himself (12-15). From the latter, he returns to the conduct of the
   Saints, who, unlike the Lord (16), were unaware of their appointed
   time, yet fled or not (17) as circumstances and the direction of the
   Spirit required them to do. The Saints if they fled were not moved to
   do so by cowardice, else how could their flight so frequently have been
   the occasion of divine communications (18-20), and how could such good
   (21, 22) have resulted from it? As a pendant to this vindication of
   flight on principle comes a short (23) but weighty rebuke of
   persecution as inherently devilish to de diokein diabolikon estin
   epicheirema. From principle, Athanasius now passes to fact. He gives a
   graphic description (24) of the night attack on the Church of Theonas,
   and shews (25, 26) how fully his action on that occasion is covered by
   the examples of the ancient Saints of God. He concludes (26, 27) with a
   somewhat exasperated denunciation of his opponents, and a prayer for
   the frustration of their intrigues.

   The Apology is a locus classicus on the duty of Christians under
   persecution. Athanasius was not the first great bishop who felt called
   upon to defend his conduct in retreating until the tyranny be overpast'
   (see Cyprian, Ep. 20. August. Ep. 228). His principles are laid down
   with regard to the common welfare. Rashness must be avoided, with its
   tendency to a reaction (17, end), and its presumption in forestalling
   the time appointed by Providence for our death. But neither must that
   time be evaded. When our end must come, we must face it quietly.
   Accordingly (22) it is a duty to escape when we can, and to hide when
   sought for rather than to follow the exceptional (ib.) action of
   certain martyrs in courting death.

   It is uncertain to whom the Defence' was addressed: it was perhaps a
   memorandum' to be circulated wherever opportunity offered. The tract
   has always been justly admired for its lucidity, force, and dignity. It
   is quoted largely by Socrates (ii. 28, iii. 8) and by Theodoret (H. E.
   ii. 15).

   I hear that Leontius [1389] , now at Antioch, and Narcissus [1390] of
   the city of Nero, and George [1391] , now at Laodicea, and the Arians
   who are with them, are spreading abroad many slanderous reports
   concerning me, charging me with cowardice, because forsooth, when I
   myself was sought by them, I did not surrender myself into their hands.
   Now as to their imputations and calumnies, although there are many
   things that I could write, which even they are unable to deny, and
   which all who have heard of their proceedings know to be true, yet I
   shall not be prevailed upon to make any reply to them, except only to
   remind them of the words of our Lord, and of the declaration of the
   Apostle, that a lie is of the Devil,' and that, revilers shall not
   inherit the kingdom of God [1392] .' For it is sufficient thereby to
   prove, that neither their thoughts nor their words are according to the
   Gospel, but that after their own pleasure, whatsoever themselves
   desire, that they think to be good.

   2. Insincerity of this charge.

   But forasmuch as they pretend to charge me with cowardice, it is
   necessary that I should write somewhat concerning this, whereby it
   shall be proved that they are men of wicked minds, who have not read
   the sacred Scriptures: or if they have read them, that they do not
   believe the divine inspiration of the oracles they contain. For had
   they believed this, they would not dare to act contrary to them, nor
   imitate the malice of the Jews who slew the Lord. For God having given
   them a commandment, Honour thy father and thy mother,' and, He that
   curseth father or mother, let him die the death [1393] ;' that people
   established a contrary law, changing the honour into dishonour, and
   alienating to other uses the money which was due from the children to
   their parents. And though they had read what David did, they acted in
   contradiction to his example, and accused the guiltless for plucking
   the ears of corn, and rubbing them in their hands on the Sabbath day
   [1394] . Not that they cared either for the laws, or for the Sabbath,
   for they were guilty of greater transgressions of the law on that day:
   but being wicked-minded, they grudged the disciples the way of
   salvation, and desired that their own private notions should have the
   sole pre-eminence. They however have received the reward of their
   iniquity, having ceased to be an holy nation, and being counted
   henceforth as the rulers of Sodom, and as the people of Gomorrah [1395]
   . And these men likewise, not less than they, seem to me to have
   received their punishment already in their ignorance of their own
   folly. For they understand not what they say, but think that they know
   things of which they are ignorant; while the only knowledge that is in
   them is to do evil, and to frame devices more and more wicked day by
   day. Thus they reproach us with our present flight, not for the sake of
   virtue, as wishing us to shew manliness by coming forward (how is it
   possible that such a wish can be entertained by enemies in behalf of
   those who run not with them in the same career of madness?); but being
   full of malice, they pretend this, and buzz [1396] all around that such
   is the case, thinking, foolish as indeed they are, that through fear of
   their revilings, we shall yet be induced to give ourselves up to them.
   For this is what they desire: to accomplish this they have recourse to
   all kinds of schemes: they pretend themselves to be friends, while they
   search as enemies, to the end that they may glut themselves with our
   blood, and put us also out of the way, because we have always opposed
   and do still oppose their impiety, and confute and brand their heresy.

   3. Outrages of the Arians against the Bishops.

   For whom have they ever persecuted and taken, that they have not
   insulted and injured as they pleased? Whom have they ever sought after
   and found, that they have not handled in such a manner, that either he
   has died a miserable death, or has been ill-treated in every way?
   Whatever the magistrates appear to do, it is their work; and the others
   are merely the tools of their will and wickedness. In consequence,
   where is there a place that has not some memorial of their malice? Who
   has ever opposed them, without their conspiring against him, inventing
   pretexts for his ruin after the manner of Jezebel? Where is there a
   Church that is not at this moment lamenting the success of their plots
   against her Bishops? Antioch is mourning for the orthodox Confessor
   Eustathius [1397] ; BalaneÃ¦ for the most admirable Euphration [1398] ;
   Paltus and Antaradus for Kymatius [1399] and Carterius; Adrianople for
   that lover of Christ, Eutropius, and his successor Lucius, who was
   often loaded with chains by their means, and so perished; Ancyra mourns
   for Marcellus, Berrhoea [1400] for Cyrus [1401] , Gaza for Asclepas. Of
   all these, after inflicting many outrages, they by their intrigues
   procured the banishment; but for Theodulus and Olympius, Bishops of
   Thrace, and for us and our Presbyters, they caused diligent search to
   be made, to the intent that if we were discovered we should suffer
   capital punishment: and probably we should have so perished, had we not
   fled at that very time contrary to their intentions. For letters to
   that effect were delivered to the Proconsul Donatus against Olympius
   and his fellows, and to Philagrius against me. And having raised a
   persecution against Paul, Bishop of Constantinople, as soon as they
   found him, they caused him to be openly strangled [1402] at a place
   called Cucusus in Cappadocia, employing as their executioner for the
   purpose Philip, who was Prefect. He was a patron of their heresy, and
   the tool of their wicked designs.

   4. Proceedings after the Council of Milan.

   Are they then satisfied with all this, and content to be quiet for the
   future? By no means; they have not given over yet, but like the
   horseleach [1403] in the Proverbs, they revel more and more in their
   wickedness, and fix themselves upon the larger dioceses. Who can
   adequately describe the enormities they have already perpetrated? who
   is able to recount all the deeds that they have done? Even very lately,
   while the Churches were at peace, and the people worshipping in their
   congregations, Liberius, Bishop of Rome, Paulinus [1404] , Metropolitan
   of Gaul, Dionysius [1405] , Metropolitan of Italy, Lucifer [1406] ,
   Metropolitan of the Sardinian islands, and Eusebius [1407] of Italy,
   all of them good Bishops and preachers of the truth, were seized and
   banished [1408] , on no pretence whatever, except that they would not
   unite themselves to the Arian heresy, nor subscribe to the false
   accusations and calumnies which they had invented against me.

   5. In praise of Hosius.

   Of the great Hosius [1409] , who answers to his name, that confessor of
   a happy old age, it is superfluous for me to speak, for I suppose it is
   known unto all men that they caused him also to be banished; for he is
   not an obscure person, but of all men the most illustrious, and more
   than this. When was there a Council held, in which he did not take the
   lead [1410] , and by right counsel convince every one? Where is there a
   Church that does not possess some glorious monuments of his patronage?
   Who has ever come to him in sorrow, and has not gone away rejoicing?
   What needy person ever asked his aid, and did not obtain what he
   desired? And yet even on this man they made their assault, because
   knowing the calumnies which they invent in behalf of their iniquity, he
   would not subscribe to their designs against us. And if afterwards,
   upon the repeated stripes above measure that were inflicted upon him,
   and the conspiracies that were formed against his kinsfolk, he yielded
   [1411] to them for a time [1412] , as being old and infirm in body, yet
   at least their wickedness is shewn even in this circumstance; so
   zealously did they endeavour by all means to prove that they were not
   truly Christians.

   6. Outrages of George upon the Alexandrians.

   After this they again fastened themselves upon Alexandria, seeking anew
   to put us to death: and their proceedings were now worse than before.
   For on a sudden the Church was surrounded by soldiers, and sounds of
   war took the place of prayers. Then George [1413] of Cappadocia who was
   sent by them, having arrived during the season of Lent [1414] , brought
   an increase of evils which they had taught him. For after Easter week,
   Virgins were thrown into prison; Bishops were led away in chains by
   soldiers; houses of orphans and widows were plundered, and their loaves
   taken away; attacks were made upon houses, and Christians thrust forth
   in the night, and their dwellings sealed up: brothers of clergymen were
   in danger of their lives on account of their brethren. These outrages
   were sufficiently dreadful, but more dreadful than these followed. For
   on the week that succeeded the Holy Pentecost [May 11], when the people
   after their fast had gone out to the cemetery to pray, because that all
   refused communion with George, that abandoned person, on learning this,
   stirred up against them the commander Sebastian, a Manichee; who
   straightway with a multitude of soldiers with arms, drawn swords, bows,
   and spears, proceeded to attack the people, though it was the Lord's
   day [1415] : and finding a few praying (for the greater part had
   already retired on account of the lateness of the hour), he committed
   such outrages as became a disciple of these men. Having lighted a pile,
   he placed certain virgins near the fire, and endeavoured to force them
   to say that they were of the Arian faith: and when he saw that they
   were getting the mastery, and cared not for the fire, he immediately
   stripped them naked, and beat them in the face in such a manner, that
   for some time they could hardly be recognised.

   7. Outrages of George.

   And having seized upon forty men, he beat them after a new fashion.
   Cutting some sticks fresh from the palm tree, with the thorns still
   upon them [1416] , he scourged them on the back so severely, that some
   of them were for a long time under surgical treatment on account of the
   thorns which had broken off in their flesh, and others unable to bear
   up under their sufferings died. All those whom they had taken, and the
   virgin, they sent away together into banishment to the great Oasis. And
   the bodies of those who had perished they would not at first suffer to
   be given up to their friends, but concealed them in any way they
   pleased, and cast them out without burial [1417] , in order that they
   might not appear to have any knowledge of these cruel proceedings. But
   herein their deluded minds greatly misled them. For the relatives of
   the dead, both rejoicing at the confession, and grieving for the bodies
   of their friends, published abroad so much the more this proof of their
   impiety and cruelty. Moreover they immediately banished out of Egypt
   and Libya the following Bishops [1418] , Ammonius, MuÃ¯us [1419] ,
   GaÃ¯us, Philo [1420] , Hermes, Plenius, Psenosiris, Nilammon, Agathus,
   Anagamphus, Marcus, Ammonius, another Marcus, Dracontius [1421] ,
   Adelphius [1422] , Athenodorus, and the Presbyters, Hierax [1423] , and
   Dioscorus; whom they drove forth under such cruel treatment, that some
   of them died on the way, and others in the place of their banishment.
   They caused also more than thirty Bishops to take to flight; for their
   desire was, after the example of Ahab, if it were possible, utterly to
   root out the truth. Such are the enormities of which these impious men
   have been guilty.

   8. If it is wrong to flee, it is worse to persecute.

   But although [1424] they have done all this, yet they are not ashamed
   of the evils they have already contrived against me, but proceed now to
   accuse me, because I have been able to escape their murderous hands.
   Nay, they bitterly bewail themselves, that they have not effectually
   put me out of the way; and so they pretend to reproach me with
   cowardice, not perceiving that by thus murmuring against me, they
   rather turn the blame upon themselves. For if it be a bad thing to
   flee, it is much worse to persecute; for the one party hides himself to
   escape death, the other persecutes with a desire to kill; and it is
   written in the Scriptures that we ought to flee; but he that seeks to
   destroy transgresses the law, nay, and is himself the occasion of the
   other's flight. If then they reproach me with my flight, let them be
   more ashamed of their own persecution [1425] . Let them cease to
   conspire, and they who flee will forthwith cease to do so. But they,
   instead of giving over their wickedness, are employing every means to
   obtain possession of my person, not perceiving that the flight of those
   who are persecuted is a strong argument against those who persecute.
   For no man flees from the gentle and the humane, but from the cruel and
   the evil-minded. Every one that was in distress, and every one that was
   in debt [1426] ,' fled from Saul, and took refuge with David. But this
   is the reason why these men desire to cut off those who are in
   concealment, that there may be no evidence forthcoming of their
   wickedness. But herein their minds seem to be blinded with their usual
   error. For the more the flight of their enemies becomes known, so much
   the more notorious will be the destruction or the banishment which
   their treachery has brought upon them [1427] ; so that whether they
   kill them outright, their death will be the more loudly noised abroad
   against them, or whether they drive them into banishment, they will but
   be sending forth everywhere monuments of their own iniquity.

   9. The accusation shews the mind of the accusers.

   Now if they had been of sound mind, they would have seen that they were
   in this strait, and that they were falling foul of their own arguments.
   But since they have lost all judgment, they are still led on to
   persecute, and seek to destroy, and yet perceive not their own impiety.
   It may be they even venture to accuse Providence itself (for nothing is
   beyond the reach of their presumption), that it does not deliver up to
   them those whom they desire; certain as it is, according to the saying
   of our Saviour, that not even a sparrow can fall into the snare without
   our Father which is in heaven [1428] . But when these accursed ones
   obtain possession of any one, they immediately forget not only all
   other, but even themselves; and raising their brow in very haughtiness,
   they neither acknowledge times and seasons, nor respect human nature in
   those whom they injure. Like the tyrant of Babylon [1429] , they attack
   more furiously; they shew pity to none, but mercilessly upon the
   ancient,' as it is written, they very heavily lay the yoke,' and they
   add to the grief of them that are wounded [1430] .' Had they not acted
   in this manner; had they not driven into banishment those who spoke in
   my defence against their calumnies, their representations might have
   appeared to some persons sufficiently plausible. But since they have
   conspired against so many other Bishops of high character, and have
   spared neither the great confessor Hosius, nor the Bishop of Rome, nor
   so many others from the Spains and the Gauls, and Egypt, and Libya, and
   the other countries, but have committed such cruel outrages against all
   who have in any way opposed them in my behalf; is it not plain that
   their designs have been directed rather against me than against any
   other, and that their desire is miserably to destroy me as they have
   done others? To accomplish this they vigilantly watch for an
   opportunity, and think themselves injured, when they see those safe,
   whom they wished not to live.

   10. Their real grievance is not that Athanasius is a coward, but that
   he is free.

   Who then does not perceive their craftiness? Is it not very evident to
   every one that they do not reproach me with cowardice from regard to
   virtue, but that being athirst for blood, they employ these their base
   devices as nets, thinking thereby to catch those whom they seek to
   destroy? That such is their character is shewn by their actions, which
   have convicted them of possessing dispositions more savage than wild
   beasts, and more cruel than Babylonians. But although the proof against
   them is sufficiently clear from all this, yet since they still
   dissemble with soft words after the manner of their father the devil
   [1431] ,' and pretend to charge me with cowardice, while they are
   themselves more cowardly than hares; let us consider what is written in
   the Sacred Scriptures respecting such cases as this. For thus they will
   be shewn to fight against the Scriptures no less than against me, while
   they detract from the virtues of the Saints.

   For if they reproach men for hiding themselves from those who seek to
   destroy them, and accuse those who flee from their persecutors, what
   will they do when they see Jacob fleeing from his brother Esau, and
   Moses withdrawing into Midian for fear of Pharaoh? What excuse will
   they make for David, after all this idle talk, for fleeing from his
   house on account of Saul, when he sent to kill him, and for hiding
   himself in the cave, and for changing his appearance, until he withdrew
   from Abimelech [1432] , and escaped his designs against him? What will
   they say, they who are ready to say anything, when they see the great
   Elijah, after calling upon God and raising the dead, hiding himself for
   fear of Ahab, and fleeing from the threats of Jezebel? At which time
   also the sons of the prophets, when they were sought after, hid
   themselves with the assistance of Obadiah, and lay concealed in caves
   [1433] .

   11. Examples of Scripture Saints in defence of flight.

   Perhaps they have not read these histories; as being out of date; yet
   have they no recollection of what is written in the Gospel? For the
   disciples also withdrew and hid themselves for fear of the Jews; and
   Paul, when he was sought after by the governor at Damascus, was let
   down from the wall in a basket, and so escaped his hands. As the
   Scripture then relates these things of the Saints, what excuse will
   they be able to invent for their wickedness? To reproach them with
   cowardice would be an act of madness, and to accuse them of acting
   contrary to the will of God, would be to shew themselves entirely
   ignorant of the Scriptures. For there was a command under the law
   [1434] that cities of refuge should be appointed, in order that they
   who were sought after to be put to death, might at least have some
   means of saving themselves. And when He Who spake unto Moses, the Word
   of the Father, appeared in the end of the world, He also gave this
   commandment, saying, But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye
   into another:' and shortly after He says, When ye therefore shall see
   the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand
   in the holy place (whoso readeth, let him understand); then let them
   which be in JudÃ¦a flee into the mountains: let him which is on the
   housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house: neither let
   him which is in the field return back to take his clothes [1435] .'
   Knowing these things, the Saints regulated their conduct accordingly.
   For what our Lord has now commanded, the same also He spoke by His
   Saints before His coming in the flesh: and this is the rule which is
   given unto men to lead them to perfection--what God commands, that to
   do.

   12. The Lord an example of timely flight.

   Wherefore also the Word Himself, being made man for our sakes,
   condescended to hide Himself when He was sought after, as we do: and
   also when He was persecuted, to flee and avoid the designs of His
   enemies. For it became Him, as by hunger and thirst and suffering, so
   also by hiding Himself and fleeing, to shew that He had taken our
   flesh, and was made man. Thus at the very first, as soon as He became
   man, when He was a little child, He Himself by His Angel commanded
   Joseph, Arise, and take the young Child and His Mother, and flee into
   Egypt; for Herod will seek the young Child's life [1436] .' And when
   Herod was dead, we find Him withdrawing to Nazareth by reason of
   Archelaus his son. And when afterwards He was shewing Himself to be
   God, and made whole the withered hand, the Pharisees went out, and held
   a council against Him, how they might destroy Him; but when Jesus knew
   it, He withdrew Himself from thence [1437] . So also when He raised
   Lazarus from the dead, from that day forth,' says the Scripture, they
   took counsel for to put Him to death. Jesus therefore walked no more
   openly among the Jews; but went thence into the country near to the
   wilderness [1438] .' Again, when our Saviour said, Before Abraham was,
   I am,' the Jews took up stones to cast at Him; but Jesus hid Himself,
   and went out of the temple [1439] .' And going through the midst of
   them, He went His way,' and so passed by [1440] .'

   13. Example of Our Lord.

   When they see these things, or rather even hear of them, for see they
   do not, will they not desire, as it is written, to become fuel of fire
   [1441] ,' because their counsels and their words are contrary to what
   the Lord both did and taught? Also when John was martyred, and his
   disciples buried his body, when Jesus heard of it, He departed thence
   by ship into a desert place apart [1442] .' Thus the Lord acted, and
   thus He taught. Would that these men were even now ashamed of their
   conduct, and confined their rashness to man, nor proceeded to such
   extreme madness as even to charge our Saviour with cowardice! for it is
   against Him that they now utter their blasphemies. But no one will
   endure such madness; nay it will be seen that they do not understand
   the Gospels. The cause must be a reasonable and just one, which the
   Evangelists represent as weighing with our Saviour to withdraw and to
   flee; and we ought therefore to assign the same for the conduct of all
   the Saints. (For whatever is written concerning our Saviour in His
   human nature, ought to be considered as applying to the whole race of
   mankind [1443] ; because He took our body, and exhibited in Himself
   human infirmity.) Now of this cause John has written thus, They sought
   to take Him: but no man laid hands on Him, because His hour was not yet
   come [1444] .' And before it came, He Himself said to His Mother, Mine
   hour is not yet come [1445] :' and to them who were called His
   brethren, My time is not yet come [1446] .' And again, when His time
   was come, He said to the disciples, Sleep on now, and take your rest:
   for behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into
   the hands of sinners [1447] .'

   14. An hour and a time for all men.

   Now in so far as He was God and the Word of the Father, He had no time;
   for He is Himself the Creator of times [1448] . But being made man, He
   shews by speaking in this manner that there is a time allotted to every
   man; and that not by chance, as some of the Gentiles imagine in their
   fables, but a time which He, the Creator, has appointed to every one
   according to the will of the Father. This is written in the Scriptures,
   and is manifest to all men. For although it be hidden and unknown to
   all, what period of time is allotted to each, and how it is allotted;
   yet every one knows this, that as there is a time for spring and for
   summer, and for autumn and for winter, so, as it is written [1449] ,
   there is a time to die, and a time to live. And so the time of the
   generation which lived in the days of Noah was cut short, and their
   years were contracted, because the time of all things was at hand. But
   to Hezekiah were added fifteen years. And as God promises to them that
   serve Him truly, I will fulfil the number of thy days [1450] ,' Abraham
   dies full of days,' and David besought God, saying, Take me not away in
   the midst of my days [1451] .' And Eliphaz, one of the friends of Job,
   being assured of this truth, said, Thou shalt come to thy grave like
   ripe corn, gathered in due time, and like as a shock of corn cometh in
   in his season [1452] .' And Solomon confirming his words, says, The
   souls of the unrighteous are taken away untimely [1453] .' And
   therefore he exhorts in the book of Ecclesiastes, saying, Be not
   overmuch wicked, neither be thou hard: why shouldest thou die before
   thy time [1454] ?'

   15. The Lord's hour and time.

   Now as these things are written in the Scriptures, the case is clear,
   that the saints know that a certain time is measured to every man, but
   that no one knows the end of that time is plainly intimated by the
   words of David, Declare unto me the shortness of my days [1455] .' What
   he did not know, that he desired to be informed of. Accordingly the
   rich man also, while he thought that he had yet a long time to live,
   heard the words, Thou fool, this night they are requiring thy soul:
   then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided [1456] ?' And
   the Preacher speaks confidently in the Holy Spirit, and says, Man also
   knoweth not his time [1457] .' Wherefore the Patriarch Isaac said to
   his son Esau, Behold, I am old, and I know not the day of my death
   [1458] .' Our Lord therefore, although as God, and the Word of the
   Father, He both knew the time measured out by Him to all, and was
   conscious of the time for suffering, which He Himself had appointed
   also to His own body; yet since He was made man for our sakes, He hid
   Himself when He was sought after before that time came, as we do; when
   He was persecuted, He fled; and avoiding the designs of His enemies He
   passed by, and so went through the midst of them [1459] .' But when He
   had brought on that time which He Himself had appointed, at which He
   desired to suffer in the body for all men, He announces it to the
   Father, saying, Father, the hour is come; glorify Thy Son [1460] .' And
   then He no longer hid Himself from those who sought Him, but stood
   willing to be taken by them; for the Scripture says, He said to them
   that came unto Him, Whom seek ye [1461] ?' and when they answered,
   Jesus of Nazareth,' He saith unto them, I am He whom ye seek.' And this
   He did even more than once; and so they straightway led Him away to
   Pilate. He neither suffered Himself to be taken before the time came,
   nor did He hide Himself when it was come; but gave Himself up to them
   that conspired against Him, that He might shew to all men that the life
   and death of man depend upon the divine sentence; and that without our
   Father which is in heaven, neither a hair of man's head can become
   white or black, nor a sparrow ever fall into the snare [1462] .

   6. The Lord's example followed by the Saints.

   Our Lord therefore, as I said before, thus offered Himself for all; and
   the Saints having received this example from their Saviour (for all of
   them before His coming, nay always, were under His teaching), in their
   conflicts with their persecutors acted lawfully in flying, and hiding
   themselves when they were sought after. And being ignorant, as men, of
   the end of the time which Providence had appointed unto them, they were
   unwilling at once to deliver themselves up into the power of those who
   conspired against them. But knowing on the other hand what is written,
   that the portions' of man are in God's hand [1463] ,' and that the Lord
   killeth [1464] ,' and the Lord maketh alive,' they the rather endured
   unto the end, wandering about [1465] ,' as the Apostle has said, in
   sheepskins, and goatskins, being destitute, tormented, wandering in
   deserts,' and hiding themselves in dens and caves of the earth;' until
   either the appointed time of death arrived, or God who had appointed
   their time spake unto them, and stayed the designs of their enemies, or
   else delivered up the persecuted to their persecutors, according as it
   seemed to Him to be good. This we may well learn respecting all men
   from David: for when Joab instigated him to slay Saul, he said, As the
   Lord liveth, the Lord shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or
   he shall descend into battle, and be delivered to the enemies; the Lord
   forbid that I should stretch forth my hand against the Lord's anointed
   [1466] .'

   17. A time to flee and a time to stay.

   And if ever in their flight they came unto those that sought after
   them, they did not do so without reason: but when the Spirit spoke unto
   them, then as righteous men they went and met their enemies; by which
   they also shewed their obedience and zeal towards God. Such was the
   conduct of Elijah, when, being commanded by the Spirit, he shewed
   himself unto Ahab [1467] ; and of Micaiah the prophet when he came to
   the same Ahab; and of the prophet who cried against the altar in
   Samaria, and rebuked Rehoboam [1468] ; and of Paul when he appealed
   unto CÃ¦sar. It was not certainly through cowardice that they fled: God
   forbid. The flight to which they submitted was rather a conflict and
   war against death. For with wise caution they guarded against these two
   things; either that they should offer themselves up without reason (for
   this would have been to kill themselves, and to become guilty of death,
   and to transgress the saying of the Lord, What God hath joined let not
   man put asunder [1469] '), or that they should willingly subject
   themselves to the reproach of negligence, as if they were unmoved by
   the tribulations which they met with in their flight, and which brought
   with them sufferings greater and more terrible than death. For he that
   dies, ceases to suffer; but he that flies, while he expects daily the
   assaults of his enemies, esteems death lighter. They therefore whose
   course was consummated in their flight did not perish dishonourably,
   but attained as well as others the glory of martyrdom. Therefore it is
   that Job was accounted a man of mighty fortitude, because he endured to
   live under so many and such severe sufferings, of which he would have
   had no sense, had he come to his end. Wherefore the blessed Fathers
   thus regulated their conduct also; they shewed no cowardice in fleeing
   from the persecutor, but rather manifested their fortitude of soul in
   shutting themselves up in close and dark places, and living a hard
   life. Yet did they not desire to avoid the time of death when it
   arrived; for their concern was neither to shrink from it when it came,
   nor to forestall the sentence determined by Providence, nor to resist
   His dispensation, for which they knew themselves to be preserved; lest
   by acting hastily, they should become to themselves the cause of
   terror: for thus it is written, He that is hasty, with his lips, shall
   bring terror upon himself [1470] .'

   18. The Saints who fled were no cowards.

   Of a truth no one can possibly doubt that they were well furnished with
   the virtue of fortitude. For the Patriarch Jacob who had before fled
   from Esau, feared not death when it came, but at that very time blessed
   the Patriarchs, each according to his deserts. And the great Moses, who
   previously had hid himself from Pharaoh, and had withdrawn into Midian
   for fear of him, when he received the commandment, Return into Egypt
   [1471] ,' feared not to do so. And again, when he was bidden to go up
   into the mountain Abarim [1472] and die, he delayed not through
   cowardice, but even joyfully proceeded thither. And David, who had
   before fled from Saul, feared not to risk his life in war in defence of
   his people; but having the choice of death or of flight set before him,
   when he might have fled and lived, he wisely preferred death. And the
   great Elijah, who had at a former time hid himself from Jezebel, shewed
   no cowardice when he was commanded by the Spirit to meet Ahab, and to
   reprove Ahaziah. And Peter, who had hid himself for fear of the Jews,
   and the Apostle Paul who was let down in a basket, and fled, when they
   were told, Ye must bear witness at Rome [1473] ,' deferred not the
   journey; yea, rather, they departed rejoicing [1474] ; the one as
   hastening to meet his friends, received his death with exultation; and
   the other shrunk not from the time when it came, but gloried in it,
   saying, For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure
   is at hand [1475] .'

   19. The Saints courageous in their flight, and divinely favoured.

   These things both prove that their previous flight was not the effect
   of cowardice; and testify that their after conduct also was of no
   ordinary character: and they loudly proclaim that they possessed in a
   high degree the virtue of fortitude. For neither did they withdraw
   themselves on account of a slothful timidity, on the contrary, they
   were at such times under the practice of a severer discipline than at
   others; nor were they condemned for their flight, or charged with
   cowardice, by such as are now so fond of criminating others. Nay they
   were blessed through that declaration of our Lord, Blessed are they
   which are persecuted for righteousness sake. [1476] ' Nor yet were
   these their sufferings without profit to themselves; for having tried
   them as gold in the furnace,' as Wisdom has said, God found them worthy
   of Himself [1477] . And then they shone the more like sparks,' being
   saved from them that persecuted them, and delivered from the designs of
   their enemies, and preserved to the end that they might teach the
   people; so that their flight and escape from the rage of them that
   sought after them, was according to the dispensation of the Lord. And
   so they became dear in the sight of God, and had the most glorious
   testimony to their fortitude.

   20. Same Subject Continued.

   Thus, for example, the Patriarch Jacob was favoured in his flight with
   many, even divine visions, and remaining quiet himself, he had the Lord
   on his side, rebuking Laban, and hindering the designs of Esau; and
   afterwards he became the Father of Judah, of whom sprang the Lord
   according to the flesh; and he dispensed the blessings to the
   Patriarchs. And when Moses the beloved of God was in exile, then it was
   that he saw that great sight, and being preserved from his persecutors,
   was sent as a prophet into Egypt, and being made the minister of those
   mighty wonders and of the Law, he led that great people in the
   wilderness. And David when he was persecuted wrote the Psalm, My heart
   uttered a good word [1478] ;' and, Our God shall come even visibly, and
   shall not keep silence [1479] .' And again he speaks more confidently,
   saying, Mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies [1480] ;' and
   again, In God have I put my trust; I will not be afraid what man can do
   unto me [1481] .' And when he fled and escaped from the face of Saul to
   the cave,' he said, He hath sent from heaven and hath saved me. He hath
   given them to reproach that would tread me under their feet. God hath
   sent His mercy and truth, and hath delivered my soul from the midst of
   lions [1482] .' Thus he too was saved according to the dispensation of
   God, and afterwards became king, and received the promise, that from
   his seed our Lord should issue. And the great Elijah, when he withdrew
   to mount Carmel, called upon God, and destroyed at once more than four
   hundred prophets of Baal; and when there were sent to take him two
   captains of fifty with their hundred men, he said, Let fire come down
   from heaven [1483] ,' and thus rebuked them. And he too was preserved,
   so that he anointed Elisha in his own stead, and became a pattern of
   discipline for the sons of the prophets. And the blessed Paul, after
   writing these words, what persecutions I endured; but out of them all
   the Lord delivered me, and will deliver [1484] ;' could speak more
   confidently and say, But in all these things we are more than
   conquerors, for nothing shall separate us from the love of Christ
   [1485] .' For then it was that he was caught up to the third heaven,
   and admitted into paradise, where he heard unspeakable words, which it
   is not lawful for a man to utter [1486] .' And for this end was he then
   preserved, that from Jerusalem even unto Illyricum' he might fully
   preach the Gospel [1487] .'

   21. The Saints fled for our sakes.

   The flight of the saints therefore was neither blameable nor
   unprofitable. If they had not avoided their persecutors, how would it
   have come to pass that the Lord should spring from the seed of David?
   Or who would have preached the glad tidings of the word of truth? It
   was for this that the persecutors sought after the saints, that there
   might be no one to teach, as the Jews charged the Apostles; but for
   this cause they endured all things, that the Gospel might be preached.
   Behold, therefore, in that they were thus engaged in conflict with
   their enemies, they passed not the time of their flight unprofitably,
   nor while they were persecuted, did they forget the welfare of others:
   but as being ministers of the good word, they grudged not to
   communicate it to all men; so that even while they fled, they preached
   the Gospel, and gave warning of the wickedness of those who conspired
   against them, and confirmed the faithful by their exhortations. Thus
   the blessed Paul, having found it so by experience, declared
   beforehand, As many as will live godly in Christ, shall suffer
   persecution [1488] .' And so he straightway prepared them that fled for
   the trial, saying, Let us run with patience the race that is set before
   us [1489] ;' for although there be continual tribulations, yet
   tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience
   hope, and hope maketh not ashamed [1490] .' And the Prophet Isaiah when
   such-like affliction was expected, exhorted and cried aloud, Come, my
   people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors; hide thyself
   as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast
   [1491] .' And so also the Preacher, who knew the conspiracies against
   the righteous, and said, If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and
   violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at
   the matter: for He that is higher than the highest regardeth, and there
   be higher than they: moreover there is the profit of the earth [1492]
   .' He had his own father David for an example, who had himself
   experienced the sufferings of persecution, and who supports them that
   suffer by the words, Be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your
   heart, all ye that put your trust in the Lord [1493] ;' for them that
   so endure, not man, but the Lord Himself (he says), shall help them,
   and deliver them, because they put their trust in Him:' for I also
   waited patiently for the Lord, and He inclined unto me, and heard my
   calling; He brought me up also out of the lowest pit, and out of the
   mire and clay [1494] .' Thus is shewn how profitable to the people and
   productive of good is the flight of the Saints, howsoever the Arians
   may think otherwise.

   22. Same subject concluded.

   Thus the Saints, as I said before, were abundantly preserved in their
   flight by the Providence of God, as physicians for the sake of them
   that had need. And to all men generally, even to us, is this law given,
   to flee when persecuted, and to hide when sought after, and not rashly
   tempt the Lord, but wait, as I said above, until the appointed time of
   death arrive, or the Judge determine something concerning them,
   according as it shall seem to Him to be good: that men should be ready,
   that, when the time calls, or when they are taken, they may contend for
   the truth even unto death. This rule the blessed Martyrs observed in
   their several persecutions. When persecuted they fled, while concealing
   themselves they shewed fortitude, and when discovered they submitted to
   martyrdom. And if some of them came and presented themselves to their
   persecutors [1495] , they did not do so without reason; for immediately
   in that case they were martyred, and thus made it evident to all that
   their zeal, and this offering up of themselves to their enemies, were
   from the Spirit.

   23. Persecution is from the Devil.

   Seeing therefore that such are the commands of our Saviour, and that
   such is the conduct of the Saints, let these persons, to whom one
   cannot give a name suitable to their character,--let them, I say, tell
   us, from whom they learnt to persecute? They cannot say, from the
   Saints [1496] . No, but from the Devil (that is the only answer which
   is left to them);--from him who says, I will persue, I will overtake
   [1497] .' Our Lord commanded to flee, and the saints fled: but
   persecution is a device of the Devil, and one which he desires to
   exercise against all. Let them say then, to which we ought to submit
   ourselves; to the words of the Lord, or to their fabrications? Whose
   conduct ought we to imitate, that of the Saints, or that of those whose
   example these men have adopted? But since it is likely they cannot
   determine this question (for, as Esaias said, their minds and their
   consciences are blinded, and they think bitter to be sweet,' and light
   darkness [1498] ') let some one come forth from among us Christians,
   and put them to rebuke, and cry with a loud voice, It is better to
   trust in the Lord, than to attend to the foolish sayings of these men;
   for the "words" of the Lord have "eternal life [1499] ," but the things
   which these utter are full of iniquity and blood.'

   24. Irruption of Syrianus.

   This were sufficient to put a stop to the madness of these impious men,
   and to prove that their desire is for nothing else, but only through a
   love of contention to utter revilings and insults. But forasmuch as
   having once dared to fight against Christ, they have now become
   officious, let them enquire and learn into the manner of my withdrawal
   from their own friends. For the Arians were mixed with the soldiers in
   order to exasperate them against me, and, as they were unacquainted
   with my person, to point me out to them. And although they are
   destitute of all feelings of compassion, yet when they hear the
   circumstances they will surely be quiet for very shame. It was now
   night [1500] , and some of the people were keeping a vigil preparatory
   to a communion on the morrow, when the General Syrianus suddenly came
   upon us with more than five thousand soldiers, having arms and drawn
   swords, bows, spears, and clubs, as I have related above. With these he
   surrounded the Church, stationing his soldiers near at hand, in order
   that no one might be able to leave the Church and pass by them. Now I
   considered that it would be unreasonable in me to desert the people
   during such a disturbance, and not to endanger myself in their behalf;
   therefore I sat down upon my throne, and desired the Deacon to read a
   Psalm, and the people to answer, For His mercy endureth for ever [1501]
   ,' and then all to withdraw and depart home. But the General having now
   made a forcible entry, and the soldiers having surrounded the sanctuary
   for the purpose of apprehending us, the Clergy and those of the laity,
   who were still there, cried out, and demanded that we too should
   withdraw. But I refused, declaring that I would not do so, until they
   had retired one and all. Accordingly I stood up, and having bidden
   prayer, I then made my request of them, that all should depart before
   me, saying that it was better that my safety should be endangered, than
   that any of them should receive hurt. So when the greater part had gone
   forth, and the rest were following, the monks who were there with us
   and certain of the Clergy came up and dragged us away. And thus (Truth
   is my witness), while some of the soldiers stood about the sanctuary,
   and others were going round the Church, we passed through, under the
   Lord's guidance, and with His protection withdrew without observation,
   greatly glorifying God that we had not betrayed the people, but had
   first sent them away, and then had been able to save ourselves, and to
   escape the hands of them which sought after us.

   25. Athanasius's wonderful escape.

   Now when Providence had delivered us in such an extraordinary manner,
   who can justly lay any blame upon me, because we did not give ourselves
   up into the hands of them that sought after us, nor return and present
   ourselves before them? This would have been plainly to shew ingratitude
   to the Lord, and to act against His commandment, and in contradiction
   to the practice of the Saints. He who censures me in this matter must
   presume also to blame the great Apostle Peter, because though he was
   shut up and guarded by soldiers, he followed the angel that summoned
   him, and when he had gone forth from the prison and escaped in safety,
   he did not return and surrender himself, although he heard what Herod
   had done. Let the Arian in his madness censure the Apostle Paul,
   because when he was let down from the wall and had escaped in safety,
   he did not change his mind, and return and give himself up; or Moses,
   because he returned not out of Midian into Egypt, that he might be
   taken of them that sought after him; or David, because when he was
   concealed in the cave, he did not discover himself to Saul. As also the
   sons of the prophets remained in their caves, and did not surrender
   themselves to Ahab. This would have been to act contrary to the
   commandment, since the Scripture says, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord
   thy God [1502] .'

   26. He acted according to the example of the Saints. Character of his
   accusers.

   Being careful to avoid such an offence, and instructed by these
   examples, I so ordered my conduct; and I do not undervalue the favour
   and the help which have been shewn me of the Lord, howsoever these in
   their madness may gnash their teeth [1503] against us. For since the
   manner of our retreat was such as we have described, I do not think
   that any blame whatever can attach to it in the minds of those who are
   possessed of a sound judgment: seeing that according to holy Scripture,
   this pattern has been left us by the Saints for our instruction. But
   there is no atrocity, it would seem, which these men neglect to
   practise, nor will they leave anything undone which may shew their own
   wickedness and cruelty. And indeed their lives are only in accordance
   with their spirit and the follies of their doctrines; for there are no
   sins that one could charge them with, how heinous soever, that they do
   not commit without shame. Leontius [1504] for instance being censured
   for his intimacy with a certain young woman, named Eustolium, and
   prohibited from living with her, mutilated himself for her sake, in
   order that he might be able to associate with her freely. He did not
   however clear himself from suspicion, but rather on this account he was
   degraded from his rank as Presbyter. [Although the heretic Constantius
   by violence caused him to be named a Bishop [1505] .] Narcissus [1506]
   , besides being charged with many other transgressions, was degraded
   three times by different Councils; and now he is among them, most
   wicked man. And George [1507] , who was a Presbyter, was deposed for
   his wickedness, and although he had nominated himself a Bishop, he was
   nevertheless a second time deposed in the great Council of Sardica. And
   besides all this, his dissolute life was notorious, for he is condemned
   even by his own friends, as making the end of existence, and its
   happiness, to consist in the commission of the most disgraceful crimes.

   27. Conclusion.

   Thus each surpasses the other in his own peculiar vices. But there is a
   common blot that attaches to them all, in that through their heresy
   they are enemies of Christ, and are no longer called Christians [1508]
   , but Arians. They ought indeed to accuse each other of the sins they
   are guilty of, for they are contrary to the faith of Christ; but they
   rather conceal them for their own sakes. And it is no wonder, that
   being possessed of such a spirit, and implicated in such vices, they
   persecute and seek after those who follow not the same impious heresy
   as themselves; that they delight to destroy them, and are grieved if
   they fail of obtaining their desires, and think themselves injured, as
   I said before, when they see those alive whom they wish to perish. May
   they continue to be injured in such sort, that they may lose the power
   of inflicting injuries, and that those whom they persecute may give
   thanks unto the Lord, and say in the words of the twenty-sixth Psalm,
   The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom then shall I fear? The Lord
   is the strength of my life; of whom then shall I be afraid? When the
   wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh,
   they stumbled and fell [1509] ;' and again the thirtieth Psalm, Thou
   hast saved my soul from adversities; thou hast not shut me up into the
   hands of mine enemies; thou hast set my foot in a large room [1510] '
   in Christ Jesus our Lord, through whom to the Father in the Holy Spirit
   be glory and power for ever and ever. Amen.

   Introduction to Historia Arianorum.

   ------------------------

   (Written 358.)

   This History takes up the narrative from the admission of Arius to
   communion at the dedication' synod of Jerusalem (adjourned Council of
   Tyre) in 335, as described in Apol. c. Ar. 84. It has been commonly
   assumed from its abrupt beginning (the tauta, referring to an
   antecedent narrative) that the History has lost its earlier chapters,
   which contained the story of Arianism ab ovo. Montfaucon suggests in
   fact that the copyists omitted the first chapters on account of their
   identity in substance with the great Apology. But this seems to require
   reconsideration. If the alleged missing chapters were different [1511]
   in form from the second part of the Apology, they would not have been
   omitted: for such repetitions of the same matter in other words are
   very frequent in the works of Athanasius: but if they were identical in
   form, they are not lost, and the conclusion is that the History was
   written with the express intention of continuing the Apology. The
   customary inference from the abrupt commencement of the History may be
   dismissed with a non sequitur. Such a commencement was natural under
   the circumstances: we may compare the case of Xenophon, whose
   Hellenica' begin with the words Meta de tauta, ou pollais hemerais
   husteron..., the reference being to the end of the history of
   Thucydides. The view here maintained is clinched by the fact that
   Athanasius at this very time reissued his Apology against the Arians
   with an appendix (Â§Â§89, 90) on the lapse of Hosius and Liberius [1512]
   .

   The History of the Arians, then, is a complete work, and written to
   continue the narrative of the second part of the Apology. Being in fact
   a manifesto against Constantius, it naturally takes up the tale just
   before his entry upon the scene as the patron of Arianism. The
   substantially Athanasian authorship of the History cannot be
   questioned. The writer occasionally, like many others ancient and
   modern, speaks of himself in the third person (references Â§21, note 5,
   see also Orat. i. 3); but in other places he clearly identifies himself
   with Athanasius. The only passage which appears to distinguish the
   writer from Athanasius (Â§52, see note), may be due to the bishop's
   habitual (Apol. Const. 11) employment of an amanuensis, but more
   probably the text is corrupt; in any case the passage cannot weigh
   against the clear sense of Â§21. The immediate Athanasian authorship of
   the piece has been questioned partly on the ground of its alleged
   incompleteness, partly on that of several slight discrepancies with
   other writings. On this twofold ground it is inferred that the Arian
   History has passed through some obscure process of re-editing (Gwatkin,
   Studies, p. 99, Â§14 dependent on the Vita [Antonii] 86,' p. 127, not an
   uncorrupted work') by a later hand. I am quite unconvinced of this. The
   incompleteness of the work is, as I think I have shewn above, an
   unnecessary hypothesis, while the mistakes or inconsistencies may well
   be due to circumstances of composition. It was written in hiding,
   perhaps while moving from place to place, certainly under more pressure
   of highly wrought agitation and bitterness of spirit than any other
   work of Athanasius. The most accurate of men when working at leisure
   make strange slips at times (e.g. Â§13, note 4); the mistakes in the
   History are not more than one might expect in such a work. The
   principal are, Â§21 (see note 3), Â§14 (reference in note 8), Â§11, prin
   genesthai tauta (cf. Encycl. 5), Â§47 (inverting order of events in
   Â§39).

   The date of the History is at first sight a difficulty. The fall of
   Liberius is dealt with in Part V., which must therefore have been
   written not earlier than 358 (the exact chronology of the lapse of
   Liberius is not certain), while yet in Â§4 Leontius, who died in the
   summer or autumn of 357, is still bishop of Antioch. We must therefore
   suppose that the History was begun at about the time when the Apologia
   de Fuga was finished (cf. the bitter conclusion of that tract) and
   completed when the lapse of Liberius was known in Egypt. A more
   accurate determination of date is not permitted by our materials.

   The tract before us is in effect a fierce anonymous pamphlet against
   Constantius. Even apart from the references in the letters to the Monks
   and to Serapion (see below), the work bears clear marks of having been
   intended for secret circulation (for the practice, see Fialon, pp.
   193-199). Instead of the "pious" Emperor who was so well versed in
   Scripture, whose presence would gladden a dedication festival, whose
   well-known humanity forbade the supposition that he could have
   perpetrated a deliberate injustice, we find a Costyllius (or
   "Connikin") whose misdeeds could only be palliated by the imbecility
   which rendered him the slave of his own servant--inhuman towards his
   nearest of kin,--false and crafty, a Pharaoh, a Saul, an Ahab, a
   Belshazzar, more cruel than Pilate or Maximian, ignorant of the
   Gospels, a patron of heresy, a precursor of Antichrist, an enemy of
   Christ, as if himself, Antichrist, and--the words must be
   written--self-abandoned to the future doom of fire' (Bright, Introd. p.
   lxxviii., and see Â§Â§9, 30, 32, 34, 40, 45, 46, 51, 53, 67-70, 74, 80).
   There are certainly many passages which one could wish that Athanasius
   had not written,--one, not necessary to specify, in which he fully
   condescends to the coarse brutality of the age, mingling it
   unpardonably with holy things. But Athanasius was human, and
   exasperated by inhuman vindictiveness and perfidy. If in the passages
   referred to he falls below himself, and speaks in the spirit of his
   generation, there are not wanting passages equal in nobility to
   anything he ever wrote. Once more to quote Dr. Bright: The beautiful
   description of the Archbishop's return from his second exile, and of
   its moral and religious effect upon Alexandrian Church society (25),
   the repeated protests against the principle of persecution as alien to
   the mind of the Church of Christ (29, 33, 67), the tender allusion to
   sympathy for the poor as instinctive in human nature (63), the vivid
   picture--doubtless somewhat coloured by imagination--of the stand made
   by Western bishops, and notably for a time by Liberius, against the
   tyrannous dictation of Constantius in matters ecclesiastical (34 sqq.
   76), the generous estimate of Hosius and Liberius in the hour of their
   infirmity (41, 45), the three golden passages which describe the union
   maintained by a common faith and a sincere affection between friends
   who are separated from each other (40), the all-sufficient presence of
   God with His servants in their extremest solitude (47), and the future
   joy when heaven would be to sufferers for the truth as a calm haven to
   sailors after a storm (79). It is in such contexts that we see the true
   Athanasius, and touch the source of his magnificent insuperable
   constancy' (p. lxxix.). Nothing could be more just, or more happily
   put. It ought to be noted before leaving this part of the subject, that
   the language put into the mouth of Constantius and the Arians (33 fin.
   1, 3, 9, 12, 15, 30, 42, 45, 60), is not so much a report of their
   words as a representationad invidiam of what is assumed to have been in
   their minds.' Other instances of this are to be found in Athanasius
   (Ep. Ã†g. 18, Orat. iii. 17), and he uses the device advisedly (de Syn.
   7, middle).

   The letter to Serapion on the death of Arius, and the letter to Monks,
   which in mss. and printed editions are prefixed to this treatise, will
   be found in the collection of letters below (No. 54 and 52). They have
   been removed from their time-honoured place in accordance with the
   general arrangement of this volume, though not without hesitation, and
   apart from any intention to dogmatise on the relation they bear to the
   present tract.

   The Arian History' has commonly been called the Hist. Arianorum ad
   Monachos,' or even the Epistola ad Monachos;' even at the present day
   it is sometimes cited simply as ad Monachos.' The History has derived
   this title from the fact, that in the Codices and editions, the Letter
   and History are frequently joined together without any sign of
   division. At the same time the correctness of this collocation is not
   entirely free from doubt.

   Serapion (Letter 54 Â§1) had written to Athanasius asking for three
   things,--a history of recent events relating to himself, an exposÃ© of
   the Arian heresy, and an exact account of the death of Arius. The
   latter Athanasius furnishes in the letter just referred to. For the two
   former, he refers Serapion to a document he had written for the monks
   (haper egrapsa tois monachois), and which he now sends to Serapion. He
   begs Serapion at the end of his letter not on any account to part with
   the letters he has received, nor to copy them (he gave, he adds, the
   same directions to the monks, cf. Letter 52. 3), but to send them back
   with such corrections and additions as he might think desirable. He
   refers him to his letter to the monks for an explanation of the
   circumstances which render this precaution necessary. The monks (ib. 1)
   had apparently made the same request as Serapion afterwards made. It
   has been conjectured that the four Orations' against Arianism, or the
   first three, are the treatise on the heresy addressed to the monks and
   subsequently sent to Serapion. But the description of that treatise
   egrapsa di oligon (Letter 52. 1) is quite inapplicable to the longest
   treatise extant among the works of Athanasius. Still less, even if the
   Arian History were a fragment (see above), could we suppose that the
   accompanying treatise formed the missing first part. We must therefore
   acquiesce in the conclusion that the treatise in question has perished.
   Accordingly we cannot be sure (although it is generally regarded as
   highly probable [1513] ) that the historical portion is preserved to us
   in the Arian History.' In any case the Letter to Monks is quite
   unconnected with it in its subject matter, and ends with the blessing,
   as the History does with the doxology, in the form of an independent
   document.

   While admitting, therefore, the naturalness of the traditional
   arrangement, we may fairly treat the two as distinct, and permit the
   Arian History to launch the reader without preamble in medias res.

   As the tract is long, and various in its subject-matter, the following
   scheme of contents may be found useful. It will be noted that
   chronological order is observed in Parts I.-IV, i.e. till 355, when the
   existing persecution of Constantius, the main theme of the History
   (Letter 52, Â§1), is reached. The history of this persecution is dealt
   with (Parts V.-VII.) with much more fulness, and is grouped round
   subjects each of which covers more or less the same period. Part VIII.
   deals with the more recent events in Egypt.

   History of the Arians.

   ------------------------

   Part I.

   Arian Persecution Under Constantine.

   And not long after they put in execution the designs for the sake of
   which they had had recourse to these artifices; for they no sooner had
   formed their plans, but they immediately admitted Arius and his fellows
   to communion. They set aside the repeated condemnations which had been
   passed upon them, and again pretended the imperial authority [1514] in
   their behalf. And they were not ashamed to say in their letters, since
   Athanasius suffered, all jealousy [1515] has ceased, and let us
   henceforward receive Arius and his fellows;' adding, in order to
   frighten their hearers, because the Emperor has commanded it.'
   Moreover, they were not ashamed to add, for these men profess orthodox
   opinions;' not fearing that which is written, Woe unto them that call
   bitter sweet, that put darkness for light [1516] ;' for they are ready
   to undertake anything in support of their heresy. Now is it not hereby
   plainly proved to all men, that we both suffered heretofore, and that
   you now persecute us, not under the authority of an Ecclesiastical
   sentence [1517] , but on the ground of the Emperor's threats, and on
   account of our piety towards Christ? As also they conspired in like
   manner against other Bishops, fabricating charges against them also;
   some of whom fell asleep in the place of their exile, having attained
   the glory of Christian confession; and others are still banished from
   their country, and contend still more and more manfully against their
   heresy, saying, Nothing shall separate us from the love of Christ
   [1518] ?'

   2. Arians sacrifice morality and integrity to party.

   And hence also you may discern its character, and be able to condemn it
   more confidently. The man who is their friend and their associate in
   impiety, although he is open to ten thousand charges for other
   enormities which he has committed; although the evidence and proof
   against him are most clear; he is approved of by them, and straightway
   becomes the friend of the Emperor, obtaining an introduction by his
   impiety; and making very many pretences, he acquires confidence before
   the magistrates to do whatever he desires. But he who exposes their
   impiety, and honestly advocates the cause of Christ, though he is pure
   in all things, though he is conscious of no delinquencies, though he
   meets with no accuser; yet on the false pretences which they have
   framed against him, is immediately seized and sent into banishment
   under a sentence of the Emperor, as if he were guilty of the crimes
   which they wish to charge upon him, or as if, like Naboth, he had
   insulted the King; while he who advocates the cause of their heresy is
   sought for and immediately sent to take possession of the other's
   Church; and henceforth confiscations and insults, and all kinds of
   cruelty are exercised against those who do not receive him. And what is
   the strangest of all, the man whom the people desire, and know to be
   blameless [1519] , the Emperor takes away and banishes; but him whom
   they neither desire, nor know, he sends to them from a distant place
   with soldiers and letters from himself. And henceforward a strong
   necessity is laid upon them, either to hate him whom they love; who has
   been their teacher, and their father in godliness; and to love him whom
   they do not desire, and to trust their children to one of whose life
   and conversation and character they are ignorant; or else certainly to
   suffer punishment, if they disobey the Emperor.

   3. Recklessness of their proceedings.

   In this manner the impious are now proceeding, as heretofore, against
   the orthodox; giving proof of their malice and impiety amongst all men
   everywhere. For granting that they have accused Athanasius; yet what
   have the other Bishops done? On what grounds can they charge them? Has
   there been found in their case too the dead body of an Arsenius? Is
   there a Presbyter Macarius, or has a cup been broken amongst them? Is
   there a Meletian to play the hypocrite? No: but as their proceedings
   against the other Bishops shew the charges which they have brought
   against Athanasius, in all probability, to be false; so their attacks
   upon Athanasius make it plain, that their accusations of the other
   Bishops are unfounded likewise. This heresy has come forth upon the
   earth like some great monster, which not only injures the innocent with
   its words, as with teeth [1520] ; but it has also hired external power
   to assist it in its designs. And strange it is that, as I said before,
   no accusation is brought against any of them; or if any be accused, he
   is not brought to trial; or if a shew of enquiry be made, he is
   acquitted against evidence, while the convicting party is plotted
   against, rather than the culprit put to shame. Thus the whole party of
   them is full of idleness; and their spies, for Bishops [1521] they are
   not, are the vilest of them all. And if any one among them desire to
   become a Bishop, he is not told, a Bishop must be blameless [1522] ;'
   but only, Take up opinions contrary to Christ, and care not for
   manners. This will be sufficient to obtain favour for you, and
   friendship with the Emperor.' Such is the character of those who
   support the tenets of Arius. And they who are zealous for the truth,
   however holy and pure they shew themselves, are yet, as I said before,
   made culprits, whenever these men choose, and on whatever pretences it
   may seem good to them to invent. The truth of this, as I before
   remarked, you may clearly gather from their proceedings.

   4. Arians persecute Eustathius and others.

   There was one Eustathius [1523] , Bishop of Antioch, a Confessor, and
   sound in the Faith. This man, because he was very zealous for the
   truth, and hated the Arian heresy, and would not receive those who
   adopted its tenets, is falsely accused before the Emperor Constantine,
   and a charge invented against him, that he had insulted his mother
   [1524] . And immediately he is driven into banishment, and a great
   number of Presbyters and Deacons with him. And immediately after the
   banishment of the Bishop, those whom he would not admit into the
   clerical order on account of their impiety were not only received into
   the Church by them, but were even appointed the greater part of them to
   be Bishops, in order that they might have accomplices in their impiety.
   Among these was Leontius the eunuch [1525] , now of Antioch, and his
   predecessor Stephanus, George of Laodicea, and Theodosius who was of
   Tripolis, Eudoxius of Germanicia, and Eustathius [1526] , now of
   Sebastia.

   5. Did they then stop here? No. For Eutropius [1527] , who was Bishop
   of Adrianople, a good man, and excellent in all respects, because he
   had often convicted Eusebius, and had advised them who came that way,
   not to comply with his impious dictates, suffered the same treatment as
   Eustathius, and was cast out of his city and his Church. Basilina
   [1528] was the most active in the proceedings against him. And
   Euphration of Balanea, Kymatius of Paltus, Carterius of Antaradus
   [1529] , Asclepas of Gaza, Cyrus of Beroea in Syria, Diodorus of Asia,
   Domnion of Sirmium, and Ellanicus of Tripolis, were merely known to
   hate the heresy; and some of them on one pretence or another, some
   without any, they removed under the authority of royal letters, drove
   them out of their cities, and appointed others whom they knew to be
   impious men, to occupy the Churches in their stead.

   6. Case of Marcellus.

   Of Marcellus [1530] , the Bishop of Galatia, it is perhaps superfluous
   for me to speak; for all men have heard how Eusebius and his fellows,
   who had been first accused by him of impiety, brought a
   counter-accusation against him, and caused the old man to be banished.
   He went up to Rome, and there made his defence, and being required by
   them, he offered a written declaration of his faith, of which the
   Council of Sardica approved. But Eusebius and his fellows made no
   defence, nor, when they were convicted of impiety out of their
   writings, were they put to shame, but rather assumed greater boldness
   against all. For they had an introduction to the Emperor from the women
   [1531] , and were formidable to all men.

   7. Martyrdom of Paul of Constantinople.

   And I suppose no one is ignorant of the case of Paul [1532] , Bishop of
   Constantinople; for the more illustrious any city is, so much the more
   that which takes place in it is not concealed. A charge was fabricated
   against him also. For Macedonius his accuser, who has now become Bishop
   in his stead (I was present myself at the accusation), afterwards held
   communion with him, and was a Presbyter under Paul himself. And yet
   when Eusebius with an evil eye wished to seize upon the Bishopric of
   that city (he had been translated in the same manner from Berytus to
   Nicomedia), the charge was revived against Paul; and they did not give
   up their plot, but persisted in the calumny. And he was banished first
   into Pontus by Constantine, and a second time by Constantius he was
   sent bound with iron chains to Singara in Mesopotamia, and from thence
   transferred to Emesa, and a fourth time he was banished to Cucusus in
   Cappadocia, near the deserts of Mount Taurus; where, as those who were
   with him have declared, he died by strangulation at their hands. And
   yet these men who never speak the truth, though guilty of this, were
   not ashamed after his death to invent another story, representing that
   he had died from illness; although all who live in that place know the
   circumstances. And even Philagrius [1533] , who was then
   Deputy-Governor [1534] of those parts, and represented all their
   proceedings in such manner as they desired, was yet astonished at this;
   and being grieved perhaps that another, and not himself, had done the
   evil deed, he informed Serapion the Bishop, as well as many other of
   our friends, that Paul was shut up by them in a very confined and dark
   place, and left to perish of hunger; and when after six days they went
   in and found him still alive, they immediately set upon the man, and
   strangled him. This was the end of his life; and they said that Philip
   who was Prefect was their agent in the perpetration of this murder.
   Divine Justice, however, did not overlook this; for not a year passed,
   when Philip was deprived of his office in great disgrace, so that being
   reduced to a private station, he became the mockery of those whom he
   least desired to be the witnesses of his fall. For in extreme distress
   of mind, groaning and trembling like Cain [1535] , and expecting every
   day that some one would destroy him, far from his country and his
   friends, he died, like one astounded at his misfortunes, in a manner
   that he least desired. Moreover these men spare not even after death
   those against whom they have invented charges whilst living. They are
   so eager to shew themselves formidable to all, that they banish the
   living, and shew no mercy on the dead; but alone of all the world they
   manifest their hatred to them that are departed, and conspire against
   their friends, truly inhuman as they are, and haters of that which is
   good, savage in temper beyond mere enemies, in behalf of their impiety,
   who eagerly plot the ruin of me and of all the rest, with no regard to
   truth, but by false charges.

   8. Restoration of the Catholics.

   Perceiving this to be the case, the three brothers, Constantine,
   Constantius, and Constans, caused all after the death of their father
   to return to their own country and Church; and while they wrote letters
   concerning the rest to their respective Churches, concerning Athanasius
   they wrote the following; which likewise shews the violence of the
   whole proceedings, and proves the murderous disposition of Eusebius and
   his fellows.

   A copy of the Letter of Constantine CÃ¦sar to the people of the Catholic
   Church in the city of the Alexandrians.

   I suppose that it has not escaped the knowledge of your pious minds
   [1536] , &c.

   This is his letter; and what more credible witness of their conspiracy
   could there be than he, who knowing these circumstances has thus
   written of them?

   Part II.

   First Arian Persecution under Constantius.

   9. Eusebius and his fellows, however, seeing the declension of their
   heresy, wrote to Rome, as well as to the Emperors Constantine and
   Constans, to accuse [1537] Athanasius: but when the persons who were
   sent by Athanasius disproved the statements which they had written,
   they were put to shame by the Emperors; and Julius, Bishop of Rome,
   wrote to say [1538] that a Council ought to be held, wherever we should
   desire, in order that they might exhibit the charges which they had to
   make, and might also freely defend themselves concerning those things
   of which they too were accused. The Presbyters also who were sent by
   them, when they saw themselves making an exposure, requested that this
   might be done. Whereupon these men, whose conduct is suspicious in all
   that they do, when they see that they are not likely to get the better
   in an Ecclesiastical trial, betake themselves to Constantius alone, and
   thenceforth bewail themselves, as to the patron of their heresy.
   Spare,' they say, the heresy; you see that all men have withdrawn from
   us; and very few of us are now left. Begin to persecute, for we are
   being deserted even of those few, and are left destitute. Those persons
   whom we forced over to our side, when these men were banished, they now
   by their return have persuaded again to take part against us. Write
   letters therefore against them all, and send out Philagrius a second
   time [1539] as Prefect of Egypt, for he is able to carry on a
   persecution favourably for us, as he has already shewn upon trial, and
   the more so, as he is an apostate. Send also Gregory as Bishop to
   Alexandria, for he too is able to strengthen our heresy.'

   10. Violent Intrusion of Gregory.

   Accordingly Constantius at once writes letters, and commences a
   persecution against all, and sends Philagrius as Prefect with one
   Arsacius an eunuch; he sends also Gregory with a military force. And
   the same consequences followed as before [1540] . For gathering
   together a multitude of herdsmen and shepherds, and other dissolute
   youths belonging to the town, armed with swords and clubs, they
   attacked in a body the Church which is called the Church of Quirinus
   [1541] ; and some they slew, some they trampled under foot, others they
   beat with stripes and cast into prison or banished. They haled away
   many women also, and dragged them openly into the court, and insulted
   them, dragging them by the hair. Some they proscribed; from some they
   took away their bread [1542] for no other reason, but that they might
   be induced to join the Arians, and receive Gregory, who had been sent
   by the Emperor.

   11. The Easterns decline the Council at Rome.

   Athanasius, however, before these things happened [1543] , at the first
   report of their proceedings, sailed to Rome, knowing the rage of the
   heretics, and for the purpose of having the Council held as had been
   determined. And Julius wrote letters to them, and sent the Presbyters
   Elpidius and Philoxenus, appointing a day [1544] , that they might
   either come, or consider themselves as altogether suspected persons.
   But as soon as Eusebius and his fellows heard that the trial was to be
   an Ecclesiastical one, at which no Count would be present, nor soldiers
   stationed before the doors, and that the proceedings would not be
   regulated by royal order (for they have always depended upon these
   things to support them against the Bishops, and without them they have
   no boldness even to speak); they were so alarmed that they detained the
   Presbyters till after the appointed time, and pretended an unseemly
   excuse, that they were not able to come now on account of the war which
   was begun by the Persians [1545] . But this was not the true cause of
   their delay, but the fears of their own consciences. For what have
   Bishops to do with war? Or if they were unable on account of the
   Persians to come to Rome, although it is at a distance and beyond sea,
   why did they like lions [1546] go about the parts of the East and those
   which are near the Persians, seeking who was opposed to them, that they
   might falsely accuse and banish them?

   12. At any rate, when they had dismissed the Presbyters with this
   improbable excuse, they said to one another, Since we are unable to get
   the advantage in an Ecclesiastical trial, let us exhibit our usual
   audacity.' Accordingly they write to Philagrius, and cause him after a
   while to go out with Gregory into Egypt. Whereupon the Bishops are
   severely scourged and cast into chains [1547] . Sarapammon, for
   instance, Bishop and Confessor, they drive into banishment; Potammon,
   Bishop and Confessor, who had lost an eye in the persecution, they beat
   with stripes on the neck so cruelly, that he appeared to be dead before
   they came to an end. In which condition he was cast aside, and hardly
   after some hours, being carefully attended and fanned, he revived, God
   granting him his life; but a short time after he died of the sufferings
   caused by the stripes, and attained in Christ to the glory of a second
   martyrdom. And besides these, how many monks were scourged, while
   Gregory sat by with Balacius the Duke!' how many Bishops were wounded!
   how many virgins were beaten!

   13. Cruelties of Gregory at Alexandria.

   After this the wretched Gregory called upon all men to have communion
   with him. But if thou didst demand of them communion, they were not
   worthy of stripes: and if thou didst scourge them as if evil persons,
   why didst thou ask it of them as if holy? But he had no other end in
   view, except to fulfil the designs of them that sent him, and to
   establish the heresy. Wherefore he became in his folly a murderer and
   an executioner, injurious, crafty, and profane; in one word, an enemy
   of Christ. He so cruelly persecuted the Bishop's aunt, that even when
   she died he would not suffer her to be buried [1548] . And this would
   have been her lot; she would have been cast away without burial, had
   not they who attended on the corpse carried her out as one of their own
   kindred. Thus even in such things he shewed his profane temper. And
   again when the widows and other mendicants [1549] had received alms, he
   commanded what had been given them to be seized, and the vessels in
   which they carried their oil and wine to be broken, that he might not
   only shew impiety by robbery, but in his deeds dishonour the Lord; from
   whom very shortly [1550] he will hear those words, Inasmuch as thou
   hast dishonoured these, thou hast dishonoured Me [1551] .'

   14. Profaneness of Gregory and death of Balacius.

   And many other things he did, which exceed the power of language to
   describe, and which whoever should hear would think to be incredible.
   And the reason why he acted thus was, because he had not received his
   ordination according to ecclesiastical rule, nor had been called to be
   a Bishop by apostolical tradition [1552] ; but had been sent out from
   court with military power and pomp, as one entrusted with a secular
   government. Wherefore he boasted rather to be the friend of Governors,
   than of Bishops and Monks. Whenever, therefore, our Father Antony wrote
   to him from the mountains, as godliness is an abomination to a sinner,
   so he abhorred the letters of the holy man. But whenever the Emperor,
   or a General, or other magistrate, sent him a letter, he was as much
   overjoyed as those in the Proverbs, of whom the Word has said
   indignantly, Woe unto them who leave the path of uprightness who
   rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked [1553]
   .' And so he honoured with presents the bearers of these letters; but
   once when Antony wrote to him he caused Duke Balacius to spit upon the
   letter, and to cast it from him. But Divine Justice did not overlook
   this; for no long time after, when the Duke was on horseback, and on
   his way to the first halt [1554] , the horse turned his head, and
   biting him on the thigh, threw him off; and within three days he died.

   Part III.

   Restoration of the Catholics on the Council of Sardica

   15. While they were proceeding in like measures towards all, at Rome
   about fifty Bishops assembled [1555] , and denounced Eusebius and his
   fellows as persons suspected, afraid to come, and also condemned as
   unworthy of credit the written statement they had sent; but us they
   received, and gladly embraced our communion. While these things were
   taking place, a report of the Council held at Rome, and of the
   proceedings against the Churches at Alexandria, and through all the
   East, came to the hearing of the Emperor Constans [1556] . He writes to
   his brother Constantius, and immediately they both determine [1557]
   that a Council shall be called, and matters be brought to a settlement,
   so that those who had been injured may be released from further
   suffering, and the injurious be no longer able to perpetrate such
   outrages. Accordingly there assemble at the city of Sardica both from
   the East and West to the number of one hundred and seventy Bishops
   [1558] , more or less; those who came from the West were Bishops only,
   having Hosius for their father, but those from the East brought with
   them instructors of youth and advocates, Count Musonianus, and
   Hesychius [1559] the Castrensian; on whose account they came with great
   alacrity, thinking that everything would be again managed by their
   authority. For thus by means of these persons they have always shewn
   themselves formidable to any whom they wished to intimidate, and have
   prosecuted their designs against whomsoever they chose. But when they
   arrived and saw that the cause was to be conducted as simply an
   ecclesiastical one, without the interference of the Count or of
   soldiers; when they saw the accusers who came from every church and
   city, and the evidence which was brought against them, when they saw
   the venerable Bishops Arius and Asterius [1560] , who came up in their
   company, withdrawing from them and siding with us [1561] , and giving
   an account of their cunning, and how suspicious their conduct was, and
   that they were fearing the consequences of a trial, lest they should be
   convicted by us of being false informers, and it should be discovered
   by those whom they produced in the character of accusers, that they had
   themselves suggested all they were to say, and were the contrivers of
   the plot. Perceiving this to be the case, although they had come with
   great zeal, as thinking that we should be afraid to meet them, yet now
   when they saw our alacrity, they shut themselves up in the Palace
   [1562] (for they had their abode there), and proceeded to confer with
   one another in the following manner: We came hither for one result; and
   we see another; we arrived in company with Counts, and the trial is
   proceeding without them. We are certainly condemned. You all know the
   orders that have been given. Athanasius and his fellows have the
   reports of the proceedings in the Mareotis [1563] , by which he is
   cleared, and we are covered with disgrace. Why then do we delay? why
   are we so slow? Let us invent some excuse and be gone, or we shall be
   condemned if we remain. It is better to suffer the shame of fleeing,
   than the disgrace of being convicted as false accusers. If we flee, we
   shall find some means of defending our heresy; and even if they condemn
   us for our flight, still we have the Emperor as our patron, who will
   not suffer the people to expel us from the Churches.'

   16. Secession of the Easterns at Sardica.

   Thus then they reasoned with themselves and Hosius and all the other
   Bishops repeatedly signified to them the alacrity of Athanasius and his
   fellows, saying, They are ready with their defence, and pledge
   themselves to prove you false accusers.' They said also, If you fear
   the trial, why did you come to meet us? either you ought not to have
   come, or now that you have come, not to flee.' When they heard this,
   being still more alarmed, they had recourse to an excuse even more
   unseemly than that they pretended at Antioch, viz. that they betook
   themselves to flight because the Emperor had written to them the news
   of his victory over the Persians. And this excuse they were not ashamed
   to send by Eustathius a Presbyter of the Sardican Church. But even thus
   their flight did not succeed according to their wishes; for immediately
   the holy Council, of which the great Hosius was president, wrote to
   them plainly, saying, Either come forward and answer the charges which
   are brought against you, for the false accusations which you have made
   against others, or know that the Council will condemn you as guilty,
   and declare Athanasius and his fellows free and clear from all blame.'
   Whereupon they were rather impelled to flight by the alarms of
   conscience, than to compliance with the proposals of the letter; for
   when they saw those who had been injured by them, they did not even
   turn their faces to listen to their words, but fled with greater speed.

   17. Proceedings of the Council of Sardica.

   Under these disgraceful and unseemly circumstances their flight took
   place. And the holy Council, which had been assembled out of more than
   five and thirty provinces, perceiving the malice of the Arians,
   admitted Athanasius and his fellows to answer to the charges which the
   others had brought against them, and to declare the sufferings which
   they had undergone. And when they had thus made their defence, as we
   said before, they approved and so highly admired their conduct that
   they gladly embraced their communion, and wrote letters to all
   quarters, to the diocese of each, and especially to Alexandria and
   Egypt, and the Libyas, declaring Athanasius and his friends to be
   innocent, and free from all blame, and their opponents to be
   calumniators, evil-doers, and everything rather than Christians.
   Accordingly they dismissed them in peace; but deposed Stephanus and
   Menophantus, Acacius and George of Laodicea, Ursacius and Valens,
   Theodorus and Narcissus. For against Gregory, who had been sent to
   Alexandria by the Emperor, they put forth a proclamation to the effect
   that he had never been made a Bishop, and that he ought not to be
   called a Christian. They therefore declared the ordinations which he
   professed to have conferred to be void, and commanded that they should
   not be even named in the Church, on account of their novel and illegal
   nature. Thus Athanasius and his friends were dismissed in peace (the
   letters concerning them are inserted at the end on account of their
   length [1564] ), and the Council was dissolved.

   18. Arian Persecution after Sardica.

   But the deposed persons, who ought now to have remained quiet, with
   those who had separated after so disgraceful a flight, were guilty of
   such conduct, that their former proceedings appear trifling in
   comparison of these. For when the people of Adrianople would not have
   communion with them, as men who had fled from the Council, and had
   proved culprits, they carried their complaints to the Emperor
   Constantius, and succeeded in causing ten of the laity to be beheaded,
   belonging to the Manufactory of arms [1565] there, Philagrius, who was
   there again as Count, assisting their designs in this matter also. The
   tombs of these persons, which we have seen in passing [1566] by, are in
   front of the city. Then as if they had been quite successful, because
   they had fled lest they should be convicted of false accusation, they
   prevailed with the Emperor to command whatsoever they wished to be
   done. Thus they caused two Presbyters and three Deacons to be banished
   from Alexandria into Armenia. As to Arius and Asterius, the one Bishop
   of PetrÃ¦ [1567] in Palestine, the other Bishop in Arabia, who had
   withdrawn from their party, they not only banished into upper Libya,
   but also caused them to be treated with insult.

   19. Tyrannical measures against the Alexandrians.

   And as to Lucius [1568] , Bishop of Adrianople, when they saw that he
   used great boldness of speech against them, and exposed their impiety,
   they again, as they had done before, caused him to be bound with iron
   chains on the neck and hands, and so drove him into banishment, where
   he died, as they know. And Diodorus a Bishop [1569] they remove; but
   against Olympius of Ã†ni, and Theodulus of Trajanople [1570] , both
   Bishops of Thrace, good and orthodox men, when they perceived their
   hatred of the heresy, they brought false charges. This Eusebius and his
   fellows had done first of all, and the Emperor Constantius wrote
   letters on the subject; and next these men [1571] revived the
   accusation. The purport of the letter was, that they should not only be
   expelled from their cities and churches, but should also suffer capital
   punishment, wherever they were discovered. However surprising this
   conduct may be, it is only in accordance with their principles; for as
   being instructed by Eusebius and his fellows in such proceedings, and
   as heirs of their impiety and evil principles, they wished to shew
   themselves formidable at Alexandria, as their fathers had done in
   Thrace. They caused an order to be written, that the ports and gates of
   the cities should be watched, lest availing themselves of the
   permission granted by the Council, the banished persons should return
   to their churches. They also cause orders to be sent to the magistrates
   at Alexandria, respecting Athanasius and certain Presbyters, named
   therein, that if either the Bishop [1572] , or any of the others,
   should be found coming to the city or its borders, the magistrate
   should have power to behead those who were so discovered. Thus this new
   Jewish heresy does not only deny the Lord, but has also learnt to
   commit murder.

   20. Plot against the Catholic Legates at Antioch.

   Yet even after this they did not rest; but as the father of their
   heresy goeth about like a lion, seeking whom he may devour, so these
   obtaining the use of the public posts [1573] went about, and whenever
   they found any that reproached them with their flight, and that hated
   the Arian heresy, they scourged them, cast them into chains, and caused
   them to be banished from their country; and they rendered themselves so
   formidable, as to induce many to dissemble, many to fly into the
   deserts, rather than willingly even to have any dealings with them.
   Such were the enormities which their madness prompted them to commit
   after their flight. Moreover they perpetrate another outrageous act,
   which is indeed in accordance with the character of their heresy, but
   is such as we never heard of before, nor is likely soon to take place
   again, even among the more dissolute of the Gentiles, much less among
   Christians. The holy Council had sent as Legates the Bishops Vincentius
   [1574] of Capua (this is the Metropolis of Campania), and Euphrates of
   Agrippina [1575] (this is the Metropolis of Upper Gaul), that they
   might obtain the Emperor's consent to the decision of the Council, that
   the Bishops should return to their Churches, inasmuch as he was the
   author of their expulsion. The most religious Constans had also written
   to his brother [1576] , and supported the cause of the Bishops. But
   these admirable men, who are equal to any act of audacity, when they
   saw the two Legates at Antioch, consulted together and formed a plot,
   which Stephanus [1577] undertook by himself to execute, as being a
   suitable instrument for such purposes. Accordingly they hire a common
   harlot, even at the season of the most holy Easter, and stripping her
   introduce her by night into the apartment of the Bishop Euphrates. The
   harlot who thought that it was a young man who had sent to invite her,
   at first willingly accompanied them; but when they thrust her in, and
   she saw the man asleep and unconscious of what was going on, and when
   presently she distinguished his features, and beheld the face of an old
   man, and the array of a Bishop, she immediately cried aloud, and
   declared that violence was used towards her. They desired her to be
   silent, and to lay a false charge against the Bishop; and so when it
   was day, the matter was noised abroad, and all the city ran together;
   and those who came from the Palace were in great commotion, wondering
   at the report which had been spread abroad, and demanding that it
   should not be passed by in silence. An enquiry, therefore, was made,
   and her master gave information concerning those who came to fetch the
   harlot, and these informed against Stephanus; for they were his Clergy.
   Stephanus, therefore, is deposed [1578] , and Leontius the eunuch
   appointed in his place, only that the Arian heresy may not want a
   supporter.

   21. Constantius' change of mind.

   And now the Emperor Constantius, feeling some compunctions, returned to
   himself; and concluding from their conduct towards Euphrates, that
   their attacks upon the others were of the same kind, he gives orders
   that the Presbyters and Deacons who had been banished from Alexandria
   into Armenia should immediately be released. He also writes publicly to
   Alexandria [1579] , commanding that the clergy and laity who were
   friends of Athanasius should suffer no further persecution. And when
   Gregory died about ten months [1580] after, he sends for Athanasius
   with every mark of honour, writing to him no less than three times a
   very friendly letter [1581] in which he exhorted him to take courage
   and come. He sends also a Presbyter and a Deacon, that he may be still
   further encouraged to return; for he thought that, through alarm at
   what had taken place before, I [1582] did not care to return. Moreover
   he writes to his brother Constans, that he also would exhort me to
   return. And he affirmed that he had been expecting Athanasius a whole
   year, and that he would not permit any change to be made, or any
   ordination to take place, as he was preserving the Churches for
   Athanasius their Bishop.

   22. Athanasius visits Constantius.

   When therefore he wrote in this strain, and encouraged him by means of
   many (for he caused Polemius, Datianus, Bardion, Thalassus [1583] ,
   Taurus [1584] , and Florentius, his Counts, in whom Athanasius could
   best confide, to write also): Athanasius committing the whole matter to
   God, who had stirred the conscience of Constantius to do this, came
   with his friends to him; and he gave him a favourable audience [1585] ,
   and sent him away to go to his country and his Churches, writing at the
   same time to the magistrates in the several places, that whereas he had
   before commanded the ways to be guarded, they should now grant him a
   free passage. Then when the Bishop complained of the sufferings he had
   undergone, and of the letters which the Emperor had written against
   him, and besought him that the false accusations against him might not
   be revived by his enemies after his departure, saying [1586] , If you
   please, summon these persons; for as far as we are concerned they are
   at liberty to stand forth, and we will expose their conduct;' he would
   not do this, but commanded that whatever had been before slanderously
   written against him should all be destroyed and obliterated, affirming
   that he would never again listen to any such accusations, and that his
   purpose was fixed and unalterable. This he did not simply say, but
   sealed his words with oaths, calling upon God to be witness of them.
   And so encouraging him with many other words, and desiring him to be of
   good courage, he sends the following letters to the Bishops and
   Magistrates.

   23. Constantius Augustus, the Great, the Conqueror, to the Bishops and
   Clergy of the Catholic Church.

   The most Reverend Athanasius has not been deserted by the grace of God
   [1587] , &c.

   Another Letter.

   From Constantius to the people of Alexandria.

   Desiring as we do your welfare in all respects [1588] , &c.

   Another Letter.

   Constantius Augustus, the Conqueror, to Nestorius, Prefect of Egypt.

   It is well known that an order was heretofore given by us, and that
   certain documents are to be found prejudicial to the estimation of the
   most reverend Bishop Athanasius; and that these exist among the Orders
   [1589] of your worship. Now we desire your Sobriety, of which we have
   good proof, to transmit to our Court, in compliance with this our
   order, all the letters respecting the fore-mentioned person, which are
   found in your Order-book.

   24. The following is the letter which he wrote after the death of the
   blessed Constans. It was written in Latin, and is here translated into
   Greek [1590] .

   Constantius Augustus, the Conqueror, to Athanasius.

   It is not unknown to your Prudence, that it was my constant prayer,
   that prosperity might attend my late brother Constans in all his
   undertakings; and your wisdom may therefore imagine how greatly I was
   afflicted when I learnt that he had been taken off by most unhallowed
   hands. Now whereas there are certain persons who at the present truly
   mournful time are endeavouring to alarm you, I have therefore thought
   it right to address this letter to your Constancy, to exhort you that,
   as becomes a Bishop, you would teach the people those things which
   pertain to the divine religion, and that, as you are accustomed to do,
   you would employ your time in prayers together with them, and not give
   credit to vain rumours, whatever they may be. For our fixed
   determination is, that you should continue, agreeably to our desire, to
   perform the office of a Bishop in your own place. May Divine Providence
   preserve you, most beloved parent, many years.

   25. Return of Athanasius from second exile.

   Under these circumstances, when they had at length taken their leave,
   and begun their journey, those who were friendly rejoiced to see a
   friend; but of the other party, some were confounded at the sight of
   him; others not having the confidence to appear, hid themselves; and
   others repented of what they had written against the Bishop. Thus all
   the Bishops of Palestine [1591] , except some two or three, and those
   men of suspected character, so willingly received Athanasius, and
   embraced communion with him, that they wrote to excuse themselves, on
   the ground that in what they had formerly written, they had acted, not
   according to their own wishes, but by compulsion. Of the Bishops of
   Egypt and the Libyan provinces, of the laity both of those countries
   and of Alexandria, it is superfluous for me to speak. They all ran
   [1592] together, and were possessed with unspeakable delight, that they
   had not only received their friends alive contrary to their hopes; but
   that they were also delivered from the heretics who were as tyrants and
   as raging dogs towards them. Accordingly great was their joy [1593] ,
   the people in the congregations encouraging one another in virtue. How
   many unmarried women, who were before ready to enter upon marriage, now
   remained virgins to Christ! How many young men, seeing the examples of
   others, embraced the monastic life! How many fathers persuaded their
   children, and how many were urged by their children, not to be hindered
   from Christian asceticism! How many wives persuaded their husbands, and
   how many were persuaded by their husbands, to give themselves to prayer
   [1594] , as the Apostle has spoken! How many widows and how many
   orphans, who were before hungry and naked, now through the great zeal
   of the people, were no longer hungry, and went forth clothed! In a
   word, so great was their emulation in virtue, that you would have
   thought every family and every house a Church, by reason of the
   goodness of its inmates, and the prayers which were offered to God. And
   in the Churches there was a profound and wonderful peace, while the
   Bishops wrote from all quarters, and received from Athanasius the
   customary letters of peace.

   26. Recantation of Ursacius and Valens.

   Moreover Ursacius and Valens, as if suffering the scourge of
   conscience, came to another mind, and wrote to the Bishop himself a
   friendly and peaceable letter [1595] , although they had received no
   communication from him. And going up to Rome they repented, and
   confessed that all their proceedings and assertions against him were
   founded in falsehood and mere calumny. And they not only voluntarily
   did this, but also anathematized the Arian heresy, and presented a
   written declaration of their repentance, addressing to the Bishop
   Julius the following letter in Latin, which has been translated into
   Greek. The copy was sent to us in Latin by Paul [1596] , Bishop of
   Treveri.

   Translation from the Latin.

   Ursacius and Valens to my Lord the most blessed Pope Julius.

   Whereas it is well known that we [1597] , &c.

   Translation from the Latin.

   The Bishops Ursacius and Valens to my Lord and Brother, the Bishop
   Athanasius.

   Having an opportunity of sending [1598] , &c.

   After writing these, they also subscribed the letters of peace which
   were presented to them by Peter and IrenÃ¦us, Presbyters of Athanasius,
   and by Ammonius a layman, who were passing that way, although
   Athanasius had sent no communication to them even by these persons.

   27. Triumph of Athanasius.

   Now who was not filled with admiration at witnessing these things, and
   the great peace that prevailed in the Churches? who did not rejoice to
   see the concord of so many Bishops? who did not glorify the Lord,
   beholding the delight of the people in their assemblies? How many
   enemies repented! How many excused themselves who had formerly accused
   him falsely! How many who formerly hated him, now shewed affection for
   him! How many of those who had written against him, recanted their
   assertions? Many also who had sided with the Arians, not through choice
   but by necessity, came by night and excused themselves. They
   anathematized the heresy, and besought him to pardon them, because,
   although through the plots and calumnies of these men they appeared
   bodily on their side, yet in their hearts they held communion with
   Athanasius, and were always with him. Believe me, this is true.

   Part IV.

   Second Arian Persecution under Constantius

   28. But the inheritors of the opinions and impiety of Eusebius and his
   fellows, the eunuch Leontius [1599] , who ought not to remain in
   communion even as a layman [1600] , because he mutilated himself that
   he might henceforward be at liberty to sleep with one Eustolium, who is
   a wife as far as he is concerned, but is called a virgin; and George
   and Acacius, and Theodorus, and Narcissus, who are deposed by the
   Council; when they heard and saw these things, were greatly ashamed.
   And when they perceived the unanimity and peace that existed between
   Athanasius and the Bishops (they were more than four hundred [1601] ,
   from great Rome, and all Italy, from Calabria, Apulia, Campania,
   Bruttia, Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, and the whole of Africa; and those
   from Gaul, Britain, and Spain, with the great Confessor Hosius; and
   also those from Pannonia, Noricum, Siscia, Dalmatia, Dardania, Dacia,
   Moesia, Macedonia, Thessaly, and all Achaia, and from Crete, Cyprus,
   and Lycia, with most of those from Palestine, Isauria, Egypt, the
   Thebais, the whole of Libya, and Pentapolis); when I say they perceived
   these things, they were possessed with envy and fear; with envy, on
   account of the communion of so many together; and with fear, lest those
   who had been entrapped by them should be brought over by the unanimity
   of so great a number, and henceforth their heresy should be
   triumphantly exposed, and everywhere proscribed.

   29. Relapse of Ursacius and Valens.

   First of all they persuade Ursacius, Valens and their fellows to change
   sides again, and like dogs [1602] to return to their own vomit, and
   like swine to wallow again in the former mire of their impiety; and
   they make this excuse for their retractation, that they did it through
   fear of the most religious Constans. And yet even had there been cause
   for fear, yet if they had confidence in what they had done, they ought
   not to have become traitors to their friends. But when there was no
   cause for fear, and yet they were guilty of a lie, are they not
   deserving of utter condemnation? For no soldier was present, no
   Palatine or Notary [1603] had been sent, as they now send them, nor yet
   was the Emperor there, nor had they been invited by any one, when they
   wrote their recantation. But they voluntarily went up to Rome, and of
   their own accord recanted and wrote it down in the Church, where there
   was no fear from without, where the only fear is the fear of God, and
   where every one has liberty of conscience. And yet although they have a
   second time become Arians, and then have devised this unseemly excuse
   for their conduct, they are still without shame.

   30. Constantius changes sides again.

   In the next place they went in a body to the Emperor Constantius, and
   besought him, saying, When we first made our request to you, we were
   not believed; for we told you, when you sent for Athanasius, that by
   inviting him to come forward, you are expelling our heresy. For he has
   been opposed to it from the very first, and never ceases to
   anathematize it. He has already written letters against us into all
   parts of the world, and the majority of men have embraced communion
   with him; and even of those who seemed to be on our side, some have
   been gained over by him, and others are likely to be. And we are left
   alone, so that the fear is, lest the character of our heresy become
   known, and henceforth both we and you gain the name of heretics. And if
   this come to pass, you must take care that we be not classed with the
   ManichÃ¦ans. Therefore begin again to persecute, and support the heresy,
   for it accounts you its king.' Such was the language of their iniquity.
   And the Emperor, when in his passage through the country on his hasty
   march against Magnentius [1604] , he saw the communion of the Bishops
   with Athanasius, like one set on fire, suddenly changed his mind, and
   no longer remembered his oaths, but was alike forgetful of what he had
   written and regardless of the duty he owed his brother. For in his
   letters to him, as well as in his interview with Athanasius, he took
   oaths that he would not act otherwise than as the people should wish,
   and as should be agreeable to the Bishops. But his zeal for impiety
   caused him at once to forget all these things. And yet one ought not to
   wonder that after so many letters and so many oaths Constantius had
   altered his mind, when we remember that Pharaoh of old, the tyrant of
   Egypt, after frequently promising and by that means obtaining a
   remission of his punishments, likewise changed, until he at last
   perished together with his associates.

   31. Constantius begins to persecute.

   He compelled then the people in every city to change their party; and
   on arriving at Arles and Milan [1605] , he proceeded to act entirely in
   accordance with the designs and suggestions of the heretics; or rather
   they acted themselves, and receiving authority from him, furiously
   attacked every one. Letters and orders were immediately sent hither to
   the Prefect, that for the future the corn should be taken from
   Athanasius and given to those who favoured the Arian doctrines, and
   that whoever pleased might freely insult them that held communion with
   him; and the magistrates were threatened if they did not hold communion
   with the Arians. These things were but the prelude to what afterwards
   took place under the direction of the Duke Syrianus. Orders were sent
   also to the more distant parts, and Notaries despatched to every city,
   and Palatines, with threats to the Bishops and Magistrates, directing
   the Magistrates to urge on the Bishops, and informing the Bishops that
   either they must subscribe against Athanasius, and hold communion with
   the Arians, or themselves undergo the punishment of exile, while the
   people who took part with them were to understand that chains, and
   insults, and scourgings, and the loss of their possessions, would be
   their portion. These orders were not neglected, for the commissioners
   had in their company the Clergy of Ursacius and Valens, to inspire them
   with zeal, and to inform the Emperor if the Magistrates neglected their
   duty. The other heresies, as younger sisters of their own [1606] , they
   permitted to blaspheme the Lord, and only conspired against the
   Christians, not enduring to hear orthodox language concerning Christ.
   How many Bishops in consequence, according to the words of Scripture,
   were brought before rulers and kings [1607] , and received this
   sentence from magistrates, Subscribe, or withdraw from your churches,
   for the Emperor has commanded you to be deposed!' How many in every
   city were roughly handled, lest they should accuse them as friends of
   the Bishops! Moreover letters were sent to the city authorities, and a
   threat of a fine was held out to them, if they did not compel the
   Bishops of their respective cities to subscribe. In short, every place
   and every city was full of fear and confusion, while the Bishops were
   dragged along to trial, and the magistrates witnessed the lamentations
   and groans of the people.

   32. Persecution by Constantius.

   Such were the proceedings of the Palatine commissioners; on the other
   hand, those admirable persons, confident in the patronage which they
   had obtained, display great zeal, and cause some of the Bishops to be
   summoned before the Emperor, while they persecute others by letters,
   inventing charges against them; to the intent that the one might be
   overawed by the presence of Constantius, and the other, through fear of
   the commissioners and the threats held out to them in these pretended
   accusations, might be brought to renounce their orthodox and pious
   opinions. In this manner it was that the Emperor forced so great a
   multitude of Bishops, partly by threats, and partly by promises, to
   declare, We will no longer hold communion with Athanasius.' For those
   who came for an interview, were not admitted to his presence, nor
   allowed any relaxation, not so much as to go out of their dwellings,
   until they had either subscribed, or refused and incurred banishment
   thereupon. And this he did because he saw that the heresy was hateful
   to all men. For this reason especially he compelled so many to add
   their names to the small number [1608] of the Arians, his earnest
   desire being to collect together a crowd of names, both from envy of
   the Bishop, and for the sake of making a shew in favour of the Arian
   impiety, of which he is the patron; supposing that he will be able to
   alter the truth, as easily as he can influence the minds of men. He
   knows not, nor has ever read, how that the Sadducees and the Herodians,
   taking unto them the Pharisees, were not able to obscure the truth;
   rather it shines out thereby more brightly every day, while they crying
   out, We have no king but CÃ¦sar [1609] ,' and obtaining the judgment of
   Pilate in their favour, are nevertheless left destitute, and wait in
   utter shame, expecting shortly [1610] to become bereft, like the
   partridge [1611] , when they shall see their patron near his death.

   33. Persecution is from the Devil.

   Now if it was altogether unseemly in any of the Bishops to change their
   opinions merely from fear of these things, yet it was much more so, and
   not the part of men who have confidence in what they believe, to force
   and compel the unwilling. In this manner it is that the Devil, when he
   has no truth on his side [1612] , attacks and breaks down the doors of
   them that admit him with axes and hammers [1613] . But our Saviour is
   so gentle that He teaches thus, If any man wills to come after Me,'
   and, Whoever wills to be My disciple [1614] ;' and coming to each He
   does not force them, but knocks at the door and says, Open unto Me, My
   sister, My spouse [1615] ;' and if they open to Him, He enters in, but
   if they delay and will not, He departs from them. For the truth is not
   preached with swords or with darts, nor by means of soldiers; but by
   persuasion and counsel. But what persuasion is there where fear of the
   Emperor prevails? or what counsel is there, when he who withstands them
   receives at last banishment and death? Even David, although he was a
   king, and had his enemy in his power, prevented not the soldiers by an
   exercise of authority when they wished to kill his enemy, but, as the
   Scripture says, David persuaded his men by arguments, and suffered them
   not to rise up and put Saul to death [1616] . But he, being without
   arguments of reason, forces all men by his power, that it may be shewn
   to all, that their wisdom is not according to God, but merely human,
   and that they who favour the Arian doctrines have indeed no king but
   CÃ¦sar; for by his means it is that these enemies of Christ accomplish
   whatsoever they wish to do. But while they thought that they were
   carrying on their designs against many by his means, they knew not that
   they were making many to be confessors, of whom are those who have
   lately [1617] made so glorious a confession, religious men, and
   excellent Bishops, Paulinus [1618] Bishop of Treveri, the metropolis of
   the Gauls, Lucifer, Bishop of the metropolis of Sardinia, Eusebius of
   Vercelli in Italy, and Dionysius of Milan, which is the metropolis of
   Italy. These the Emperor summoned before him, and commanded them to
   subscribe against Athanasius, and to hold communion with the heretics;
   and when they were astonished at this novel procedure, and said that
   there was no Ecclesiastical Canon to this effect, he immediately said,
   Whatever I will, be that esteemed a Canon; the "Bishops" of Syria let
   me thus speak. Either then obey, or go into banishment.'

   34. Banishment of the Western Bishops spread the knowledge of the
   truth.

   When the Bishops heard this they were utterly amazed, and stretching
   forth their hands to God, they used great boldness of speech against
   him teaching him that the kingdom was not his, but God's, who had given
   it to him, Whom also they bid him fear, lest He should suddenly take it
   away from him. And they threatened him with the day of judgment, and
   warned him against infringing Ecclesiastical order, and mingling Roman
   sovereignty with the constitution [1619] of the Church, and against
   introducing the Arian heresy into the Church of God. But he would not
   listen to them, nor permit them to speak further, but threatened them
   so much the more, and drew his sword against them, and gave orders for
   some of them to be led to execution; although afterwards, like Pharaoh,
   he repented. The holy men therefore shaking off the dust, and looking
   up to God, neither feared the threats of the Emperor, nor betrayed
   their cause before his drawn sword; but received their banishment, as a
   service pertaining to their ministry. And as they passed along, they
   preached the Gospel in every place and city [1620] , although they were
   in bonds, proclaiming the orthodox faith, anathematizing the Arian
   heresy, and stigmatizing the recantation of Ursacius and Valens. But
   this was contrary to the intention of their enemies; for the greater
   was the distance of their place of banishment, so much the more was the
   hatred against them increased, while the wanderings of these men were
   but the heralding of their impiety. For who that saw them as they
   passed along, did not greatly admire them as Confessors, and renounce
   and abominate the others, calling them not only impious men, but
   executioners and murderers, and everything rather than Christians?

   Part V.

   Persecution and Lapse of Liberius

   35. Now it had been better if from the first Constantius had never
   become connected with this heresy at all; or being connected with it,
   if he had not yielded so much to those impious men; or having yielded
   to them, if he had stood by them only thus far, so that judgment might
   come upon them all for these atrocities alone. But as it would seem,
   like madmen, having fixed themselves in the bonds of impiety, they are
   drawing down upon their own heads a more severe judgment. Thus from the
   first [1621] they spared not even Liberius, Bishop of Rome, but
   extended [1622] their fury even to those parts; they respected not his
   bishopric, because it was an Apostolical throne; they felt no reverence
   for Rome, because she is the Metropolis of Romania [1623] ; they
   remembered not that formerly in their letters they had spoken of her
   Bishops as Apostolical men. But confounding all things together, they
   at once forgot everything, and cared only to shew their zeal in behalf
   of impiety. When they perceived that he was an orthodox man and hated
   the Arian heresy, and earnestly endeavoured to persuade all persons to
   renounce and withdraw from it, these impious men reasoned thus with
   themselves: If we can persuade Liberius, we shall soon prevail over
   all.' Accordingly they accused him falsely before the Emperor; and he,
   expecting easily to draw over all men to his side by means of Liberius,
   writes to him, and sends a certain eunuch called Eusebius with letters
   and offerings, to cajole him with the presents, and to threaten him
   with the letters. The eunuch accordingly went to Rome, and first
   proposed to Liberius to subscribe against Athanasius, and to hold
   communion with the Arians, saying, The Emperor wishes it, and commands
   you to do so.' And then shewing him the offerings, he took him by the
   hand, and again besought him saying, Obey the Emperor, and receive
   these.'

   36. The Eunuch Eusebius attempts Liberius in vain.

   But the Bishop endeavoured to convince him, reasoning with him thus:
   How is it possible for me to do this against Athanasius? how can we
   condemn a man, whom not one [1624] Council only, but a second [1625]
   assembled from all parts of the world, has fairly acquitted, and whom
   the Church of the Romans dismissed in peace? who will approve of our
   conduct, if we reject in his absence one, whose presence [1626] amongst
   us we gladly welcomed, and admitted him to our communion? This is no
   Ecclesiastical Canon; nor have we had transmitted to us any such
   tradition [1627] from the Fathers, who in their turn received from the
   great and blessed Apostle Peter [1628] . But if the Emperor is really
   concerned for the peace of the Church, if he requires our letters
   respecting Athanasius to be reversed, let their proceedings both
   against him and against all the others be reversed also; and then let
   an Ecclesiastical Council be called at a distance from the Court, at
   which the Emperor shall not be present, nor any Count be admitted, nor
   magistrate to threaten us, but where only the fear of God and the
   Apostolical rule [1629] shall prevail; that so in the first place, the
   faith of the Church may be secure, as the Fathers defined it in the
   Council of NicÃ¦a, and the supporters of the Arian doctrines may be cast
   out, and their heresy anathematized. And then after that, an enquiry
   being made into the charges brought against Athanasius, and any other
   besides, as well as into those things of which the other party is
   accused, let the culprits be cast out, and the innocent receive
   encouragement and support. For it is impossible that they who maintain
   an impious creed can be admitted as members of a Council: nor is it fit
   that an enquiry into matters of conduct should precede the enquiry
   concerning the faith [1630] ; but all diversity of opinions on points
   of faith ought first to be eradicated, and then the enquiry made into
   matters of conduct. Our Lord Jesus Christ did not heal them that were
   afflicted, until they shewed and declared what faith they had in Him.
   These things we have received from the Fathers; these report to the
   Emperor; for they are both profitable for him and edifying to the
   Church. But let not Ursacius and Valens be listened to, for they have
   retracted their former assertions, and in what they now say they are
   not to be trusted.'

   37. Liberius refuses the Emperor's offering.

   These were the words of the Bishop Liberius. And the eunuch, who was
   vexed, not so much because he would not subscribe, as because he found
   him an enemy to the heresy, forgetting that he was in the presence of a
   Bishop, after threatening him severely, went away with the offerings;
   and next commits an offence, which is foreign to a Christian, and too
   audacious for a eunuch. In imitation of the transgression of Saul, he
   went to the Martyry [1631] of the Apostle Peter, and then presented the
   offerings. But Liberius having notice of it, was very angry with the
   person who kept the place, that he had not prevented him, and cast out
   the offerings as an unlawful sacrifice, which increased the anger of
   the mutilated creature against him. Consequently he exasperates the
   Emperor against him, saying, The matter that concerns us is no longer
   the obtaining the subscription of Liberius, but the fact that he is so
   resolutely opposed to the heresy, that he anathematizes the Arians by
   name.' He also stirs up the other eunuchs to say the same; for many of
   those who were about Constantius, or rather the whole number of them,
   are eunuchs [1632] , who engross all the influence with him, and it is
   impossible to do anything there without them. The Emperor accordingly
   writes to Rome, and again Palatines, and Notaries, and Counts are sent
   off with letters to the Prefect, in order that either they may inveigle
   Liberius by stratagem away from Rome and send him to the Court to him,
   or else persecute him by violence.

   38. The evil influence of Eunuchs at Court.

   Such being the tenor of the letters, there also fear and treachery
   forthwith became rife throughout the whole city. How many were the
   families against which threats were held out! How many received great
   promises on condition of their acting against Liberius! How many
   Bishops hid themselves when they saw these things! How many noble women
   retired to country places in consequence of the calumnies of the
   enemies of Christ! How many ascetics were made the objects of their
   plots! How many who were sojourning there, and had made that place
   their home, did they cause to be persecuted! How often and how strictly
   did they guard the harbour [1633] and the approaches to the gates, lest
   any orthodox person should enter and visit Liberius! Rome also had
   trial of the enemies of Christ, and now experienced what before she
   would not believe, when she heard how the other Churches in every city
   were ravaged by them. It was the eunuchs who instigated these
   proceedings against all. And the most remarkable circumstance in the
   matter is this; that the Arian heresy which denies the Son of God,
   receives its support from eunuchs, who, as both their bodies are
   fruitless, and their souls barren of virtue, cannot bear even to hear
   the name of son. The Eunuch of Ethiopia indeed, though he understood
   not what he read [1634] , believed the words of Philip, when he taught
   him concerning the Saviour; but the eunuchs of Constantius cannot
   endure the confession of Peter [1635] , nay, they turn away when the
   Father manifests the Son, and madly rage against those who say, that
   the Son of God is His genuine Son, thus claiming as a heresy of
   eunuchs, that there is no genuine and true offspring of the Father. On
   these grounds it is that the law forbids such persons to be admitted
   into any ecclesiastical Council [1636] ; notwithstanding which they
   have now regarded these as competent judges of ecclesiastical causes,
   and whatever seems good to them, that Constantius decrees, while men
   with the name of Bishops dissemble with them. Oh! who shall be their
   historian? who shall transmit the record of these things to another
   generation? who indeed would believe it, were he to hear it, that
   eunuchs who are scarcely entrusted with household services (for theirs
   is a pleasure-loving race, that has no serious concern but that of
   hindering in others what nature has taken from them); that these, I
   say, now exercise authority in ecclesiastical matters, and that
   Constantius in submission to their will treacherously conspired against
   all, and banished Liberius!

   39. Liberius's speech to Constantius.

   For after the Emperor had frequently written to Rome, had threatened,
   sent commissioners, devised schemes, on the persecution [1637]
   subsequently breaking out at Alexandria, Liberius is dragged before
   him, and uses great boldness of speech towards him. Cease,' he said, to
   persecute the Christians; attempt not by my means to introduce impiety
   into the Church. We are ready to suffer anything rather than to be
   called Arian madmen. We are Christians; compel us not to become enemies
   of Christ. We also give you this counsel: fight not against Him who
   gave you this empire, nor shew impiety towards Him instead of
   thankfulness [1638] ;' persecute not them that believe in Him, lest you
   also hear the words, It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks
   [1639] .' Nay, I would that you might hear them, that you might obey,
   as the holy Paul did. Behold, here we are; we are come, before they
   fabricate charges. For this cause we hastened hither, knowing that
   banishment awaits us at your hands, that we might suffer before a
   charge encounters us, and that all may clearly see that all the others
   too have suffered as we shall suffer, and that the charges brought
   against them were fabrications of their enemies, and all their
   proceedings were mere calumny and falsehood.'

   40. Banishment of Liberius and others.

   These were the words of Liberius at that time, and he was admired by
   all men for them. But the Emperor instead of answering [1640] , only
   gave orders for their banishment, separating each of them from the
   rest, as he had done in the former cases. For he had himself devised
   this plan in the banishments which he inflicted, that so the severity
   of his punishments might be greater than that of former tyrants and
   persecutors [1641] . In the former persecution Maximian, who was then
   Emperor, commanded a number of Confessors to be banished together
   [1642] , and thus lightened their punishment by the consolation which
   he gave them in each other's society. But this man was more savage than
   he; he separated those who had spoken boldly and confessed together, he
   put asunder those who were united by the bond of faith, that when they
   came to die they might not see one another; thinking that bodily
   separation can disunite also the affections of the mind, and that being
   severed from each other, they would forget the concord and unanimity
   which existed among them. He knew not that however each one may remain
   [1643] apart from the rest, he has nevertheless with him that Lord,
   whom they confessed in one body together, who will also provide (as he
   did in the case of the Prophet Elisha [1644] ) that more shall be with
   each of them, than there are soldiers with Constantius. Of a truth
   iniquity is blind; for in that they thought to afflict the Confessors,
   by separating them from one another, they rather brought thereby a
   great injury upon themselves. For had they continued in each other's
   company, and abode together, the pollutions of those impious men would
   have been proclaimed from one place only; but now by putting them
   asunder, they have made their impious heresy and wickedness to spread
   abroad and become known in every place [1645] .

   41. Lapse of Liberius.

   Who that shall hear what they did in the course of these proceedings
   will not think them to be anything rather than Christians? When
   Liberius sent Eutropius, a Presbyter, and Hilarius, a Deacon, with
   letters to the Emperor, at the time that Lucifer and his fellows made
   their confession, they banished the Presbyter on the spot, and after
   stripping Hilarius [1646] the Deacon and scourging him on the back,
   they banished him too, clamouring at him, Why didst thou not resist
   Liberius instead of being the bearer of letters from him.' Ursacius and
   Valens, with the eunuchs who sided with them, were the authors of this
   outrage. The Deacon, while he was being scourged, praised the Lord,
   remembering His words, I gave My back to the smiters [1647] ;' but they
   while they scourged him laughed and mocked him, feeling no shame that
   they were insulting a Levite. Indeed they acted but consistently in
   laughing while he continued to praise God; for it is the part of
   Christians to endure stripes, but to scourge Christians is the outrage
   of a Pilate or a Caiaphas. Thus they endeavoured at the first to
   corrupt the Church of the Romans, wishing to introduce impiety into it
   as well as others. But Liberius after he had been in banishment two
   years gave way, and from fear of threatened death subscribed. Yet even
   this only shews their violent conduct, and the hatred of Liberius
   against the heresy, and his support of Athanasius, so long as he was
   suffered to exercise a free choice. For that which men are forced by
   torture to do contrary to their first judgment, ought not to be
   considered the willing deed of those who are in fear, but rather of
   their tormentors. They however attempted everything in support of their
   heresy, while the people in every Church, preserving the faith which
   they had learnt, waited for the return of their teachers, and condemned
   the Antichristian heresy, and all avoid it, as they would a serpent.

   Part VI.

   Persecution and Lapse of Hosius

   42. But although they had done all this, yet these impious men thought
   they had accomplished nothing, so long as the great Hosius escaped
   their wicked machinations. And now they undertook to extend their fury
   [1648] to that great old man. They felt no shame at the thought that he
   is the father [1649] of the Bishops; they regarded not that he had been
   a Confessor [1650] ; they reverenced not the length of his Episcopate,
   in which he had continued more than sixty years; but they set aside
   everything, and looked only to the interests of their heresy, as being
   of a truth such as neither fear God, nor regard man [1651] .
   Accordingly they went to Constantius, and again employed such arguments
   as the following: We have done everything; we have banished the Bishop
   of the Romans; and before him a very great number of other Bishops, and
   have filled every place with alarm. But these strong measures of yours
   are as nothing to us, nor is our success at all more secure, so long as
   Hosius remains. While he is in his own place, the rest also continue in
   their Churches, for he is able by his arguments and his faith to
   persuade all men against us. He is the president of Councils [1652] ,
   and his letters are everywhere attended to. He it was who put forth the
   Nicene Confession, and proclaimed everywhere that the Arians were
   heretics. If therefore he is suffered to remain, the banishment of the
   rest is of no avail, for our heresy will be destroyed. Begin then to
   persecute him also and spare him not, ancient as he is. Our heresy
   knows not to honour even the hoary hairs of the aged.'

   43. Brave resistance of Hosius.

   Upon hearing this, the Emperor no longer delayed, but knowing the man,
   and the dignity of his years, wrote to summon him. This was when he
   first [1653] began his attempt upon Liberius. Upon his arrival he
   desired him, and urged him with the usual arguments, with which he
   thought also to deceive the others, that he would subscribe against us,
   and hold communion with the Arians. But the old man, scarcely bearing
   to hear the words, and grieved that he had even ventured to utter such
   a proposal, severely rebuked him, and after gaining his consent,
   withdrew to his own country and Church. But the heretics still
   complaining, and instigating him to proceed (he had the eunuchs also to
   remind him and to urge him further), the Emperor again wrote in
   threatening terms; but still Hosius, while he endured their insults,
   was unmoved by any fear of their designs against him, and remaining
   firm to his purpose, as one who had built the house of his faith upon
   the rock, he spake boldly against the heresy, regarding the threats
   held out to him in the letters but as drops of rain and blasts of wind.
   And although Constantius wrote frequently, sometimes flattering him
   with the title of Father, and sometimes threatening and recounting the
   names of those who had been banished, and saying, Will you continue the
   only person to oppose the heresy? Be persuaded and subscribe against
   Athanasius; for whoever subscribes against him thereby embraces with us
   the Arian cause;' still Hosius remained fearless, and while suffering
   these insults, wrote an answer in such terms as these. We have read the
   letter, which is placed at the end [1654] .

   44. Hosius to Constantius the Emperor sends health in the Lord.'

   I was a Confessor at the first, when a persecution arose in the time of
   your grandfather Maximian; and if you shall persecute me, I am ready
   now, too, to endure anything rather than to shed innocent blood and to
   betray the truth. But I cannot approve of your conduct in writing after
   this threatening manner. Cease to write thus; adopt not the cause of
   Arius, nor listen to those in the East, nor give credit to Ursacius,
   Valens and their fellows. For whatever they assert, it is not on
   account of Athanasius, but for the sake of their own heresy. Believe my
   statement, O Constantius, who am of an age to be your grandfather. I
   was present at the Council of Sardica, when you and your brother
   Constans of blessed memory assembled us all together; and on my own
   account I challenged the enemies of Athanasius, when they came to the
   church where I abode [1655] , that if they had anything against him
   they might declare it; desiring them to have confidence, and not to
   expect otherwise than that a right judgment would be passed in all
   things. This I did once and again, requesting them, if they were
   unwilling to appear before the whole Council, yet to appear before me
   alone; promising them also, that if he should be proved guilty, he
   should certainly be rejected by us; but if he should be found to be
   blameless, and should prove them to be calumniators, that if they
   should then refuse to hold communion with him, I would persuade him to
   go with me into the Spains. Athanasius was willing to comply with these
   conditions, and made no objection to my proposal; but they, altogether
   distrusting their cause, would not consent. And on another occasion
   Athanasius came to your Court [1656] , when you wrote for him, and his
   enemies being at the time in Antioch, he requested that they might be
   summoned either altogether or separately, in order that they might
   either convict him, or be convicted [1657] , and might either in his
   presence prove him to be what they represented, or cease to accuse him
   when absent. To this proposal also you would not listen, and they
   equally rejected it. Why then do you still give ear to them that speak
   evil of him? How can you endure Valens and Ursacius, although they have
   retracted and made a written confession of their calumnies [1658] ? For
   it is not true, as they pretend, that they were forced to confess;
   there were no soldiers at hand to influence them; your brother was not
   cognizant of the matter [1659] . No, such things were not done under
   his government, as are done now; God forbid. But they voluntarily went
   up to Rome, and in the presence of the Bishop and Presbyters wrote
   their recantation, having previously addressed to Athanasius a friendly
   and peaceable letter. And if they pretend that force was employed
   towards them, and acknowledge that this is an evil thing, which you
   also disapprove of; then do you cease to use force; write no letters,
   send no Counts; but release those that have been banished, lest while
   you are complaining of violence, they do but exercise greater violence.
   When was any such thing done by Constans? What Bishop suffered
   banishment? When did he appear as arbiter of an Ecclesiastical trial?
   When did any Palatine of his compel men to subscribe against any one,
   that Valens and his fellows should be able to affirm this? Cease these
   proceedings, I beseech you, and remember that you are a mortal man. Be
   afraid of the day of judgment, and keep yourself pure thereunto.
   Intrude not yourself into Ecclesiastical matters, neither give commands
   unto us concerning them; but learn them from us. God has put into your
   hands the kingdom; to us He has entrusted the affairs of His Church;
   and as he who would steal the empire from you would resist the
   ordinance of God, so likewise fear on your part lest by taking upon
   yourself the government of the Church, you become guilty of a great
   offence. It is written, "Render unto CÃ¦sar the things that are CÃ¦sar's,
   and unto God the things that are God's [1660] ." Neither therefore is
   it permitted unto us to exercise an earthly rule, nor have you, Sire,
   any authority to burn incense [1661] . These things I write unto you
   out of a concern for your salvation. With regard to the subject of your
   letters, this is my determination; I will not unite myself to the
   Arians; I anathematize their heresy. Neither will I subscribe against
   Athanasius, whom both we and the Church of the Romans and the whole
   Council pronounced to be guiltless. And yourself also, when you
   understood this, sent for the man, and gave him permission to return
   with honour to his country and his Church. What reason then can there
   be for so great a change in your conduct? The same persons who were his
   enemies before, are so now also; and the things they now whisper to his
   prejudice (for they do not declare them openly in his presence), the
   same they spoke against him, before you sent for him; the same they
   spread abroad concerning him when they come to the Council. And when I
   required them to come forward, as I have before said, they were unable
   to produce their proofs; had they possessed any, they would not have
   fled so disgracefully. Who then persuaded you so long after to forget
   your own letters and declarations? Forbear, and be not influenced by
   evil men, lest while you act for the mutual advantage of yourself and
   them, you render yourself responsible. For here you comply with their
   desires, hereafter in the judgment you will have to answer for doing so
   alone. These men desire by your means to injure their enemy, and wish
   to make you the minister of their wickedness, in order that through
   your help they may sow the seeds [1662] of their accursed heresy in the
   Church. Now it is not a prudent thing to cast one's self into manifest
   danger for the pleasure of others. Cease then, I beseech you, O
   Constantius, and be persuaded by me. These things it becomes me to
   write, and you not to despise.'

   45. Lapse of Hosius, due to cruel persecution.

   Such were the sentiments, and such the letter, of the Abraham-like old
   man, Hosius, truly so called [1663] . But the Emperor desisted not from
   his designs, nor ceased to seek an occasion against him; but continued
   to threaten him severely, with a view either to bring him over by
   force, or to banish him if he refused to comply. And as the Officers
   and Satraps of Babylon [1664] , seeking an occasion against Daniel,
   found none except in the law of his God; so likewise these present
   Satraps of impiety were unable to invent any charge against the old man
   (for this true Hosius, and his blameless life were known to all),
   except the charge of hatred to their heresy. They therefore proceeded
   to accuse him; though not under the same circumstances as those others
   accused Daniel to Darius, for Darius was grieved to hear the charge,
   but as Jezebel accused Naboth, and as the Jews applied themselves to
   Herod. And they said, He not only will not subscribe against
   Athanasius, but also on his account condemns us; and his hatred to the
   heresy is so great, that he also writes to others, that they should
   rather suffer death, than become traitors to the truth. For, he says,
   our beloved Athanasius also is persecuted for the Truth's sake, and
   Liberius, Bishop of Rome, and all the rest, are treacherously
   assailed.' When this patron of impiety, and Emperor of heresy [1665] ,
   Constantius, heard this, and especially that there were others also in
   the Spains of the same mind as Hosius, after he had tempted them also
   to subscribe, and was unable to compel them to do so, he sent for
   Hosius, and instead of banishing him, detained him a whole year in
   Sirmium. Godless, unholy, without natural affection, he feared not God,
   he regarded not his father's affection for Hosius, he reverenced not
   his great age, for he was now a hundred years old [1666] ; but all
   these things this modern Ahab, this second Belshazzar of our times,
   disregarded for the sake of impiety. He used such violence towards the
   old man, and confined him so straitly, that at last, broken by
   suffering, he was brought, though hardly, to hold communion with
   Valens, Ursacius, and their fellows, though he would not subscribe
   against Athanasius. Yet even thus he forgot not his duty, for at the
   approach of death, as it were by his last testament, he bore witness to
   the force which had been used towards him, and anathematized the Arian
   heresy, and gave strict charge that no one should receive it.

   46. Arbitrary expulsion of so many bishops.

   Who that witnessed these things, or that has merely heard of them, will
   not be greatly amazed, and cry aloud unto the Lord, saying, Wilt Thou
   make a full end of Israel [1667] ?' Who that is acquainted with these
   proceedings, will not with good reason cry out and say, A wonderful and
   horrible thing is done in the land;' and, The heavens are astonished at
   this, and the earth is even more horribly afraid [1668] .' The fathers
   of the people and the teachers of the faith are taken away, and the
   impious are brought into the Churches? Who that saw when Liberius,
   Bishop of Rome, was banished, and when the great Hosius, the father
   [1669] of the Bishops, suffered these things, or who that saw so many
   Bishops banished out of Spain and the other parts, could fail to
   perceive, however little sense he might possess, that the charges
   [1670] against Athanasius also and the rest were false, and altogether
   mere calumny? For this reason those others also endured all suffering,
   because they saw plainly that the conspiracies laid against these were
   founded in falsehood. For what charge was there against Liberius? or
   what accusation against the aged Hosius? who bore even a false witness
   against Paulinus, and Lucifer, and Dionysius, and Eusebius? or what sin
   could be lain to the account of the rest of the banished Bishops, and
   Presbyters, and Deacons? None whatever; God forbid. There were no
   charges against them on which a plot for their ruin might be formed;
   nor was it on the ground of any accusation that they were severally
   banished. It was an insurrection of impiety against godliness; it was
   zeal for the Arian heresy, and a prelude to the coming of Antichrist,
   for whom Constantius is thus preparing the way.

   Part VII.

   Persecution at Alexandria

   47. After' he had accomplished all that he desired against the Churches
   in Italy, and the other parts; after he had banished some, and
   violently oppressed others, and filled every place with fear, he at
   last turned his fury, as it had been some pestilential disorder,
   against Alexandria. This was artfully contrived by the enemies of
   Christ; for in order that they might have a show of the signatures of
   many Bishops, and that Athanasius might not have a single Bishop in his
   persecution to whom he could even complain, they therefore anticipated
   his proceedings, and filled every place with terror, which they kept up
   to second them in the prosecution of their designs. But herein they
   perceived not through their folly that they were not exhibiting the
   deliberate choice of the Bishops, but rather the violence which
   themselves had employed; and that, although his brethren should desert
   him, and his friends and acquaintance stand afar off, and no one be
   found to sympathise with him and console him, yet far above all these,
   a refuge with his God was sufficient for him. For Elijah also was alone
   in his persecution, and God was all in all to the holy man. And the
   Saviour has given us an example herein, who also was left alone, and
   exposed to the designs of His enemies, to teach us, that when we are
   persecuted and deserted by men, we must not faint, but place our hope
   in Him, and not betray the Truth. For although at first truth may seem
   to be afflicted, yet even they who persecute shall afterwards
   acknowledge it.

   48. Attacks upon the Alexandrian Church.

   Accordingly they urge on the Emperor, who first writes a menacing
   letter, which he sends to the Duke and the soldiers. The Notaries
   Diogenius and Hilarius [1671] , and certain Palatines with them, were
   the bearers of it; upon whose arrival those terrible and cruel outrages
   were committed against the Church, which I have briefly related a
   little above [1672] , and which are known to all men from the protests
   put forth by the people, which are inserted at the end of this history,
   so that any one may read them. Then after these proceedings on the part
   of Syrianus, after these enormities had been perpetrated, and violence
   offered to the Virgins, as approving of such conduct and the infliction
   of these evils upon us, he writes again to the senate and people of
   Alexandria, instigating the younger men, and requiring them to assemble
   together, and either to persecute Athanasius, or consider themselves as
   his enemies. He however had withdrawn before these instructions reached
   them, and from the time when Syrianus broke into the Church; for he
   remembered that which was written, Hide thyself as it were for a little
   moment, until the indignation be overpast [1673] .' One Heraclius, by
   rank a Count, was the bearer of this letter, and the precursor of a
   certain George that was despatched by the Emperor as a spy, for one
   that was sent from him cannot be a Bishop [1674] ; God forbid. And so
   indeed his conduct and the circumstances which preceded his entrance
   sufficiently prove.

   49 and 50. Hypocrisy of the pretended respect of Constantius for his
   brother's memory.

   Heraclius then published the letter, which reflected great disgrace
   upon the writer. For whereas, when the great Hosius wrote to
   Constantius, he had been unable to make out any plausible pretext for
   his change of conduct, he now invented an excuse much more
   discreditable to himself and his advisers. He said, From regard to the
   affection I entertained towards my brother of divine and pious memory,
   I endured for a time the coming of Athanasius among you.' This proves
   that he has both broken his promise, and behaved ungratefully to his
   brother after his death. He then declares him to be, as indeed he is,
   deserving of divine and pious remembrance;' yet as regards a command of
   his, or to use his own language, the affection' he bore him, even
   though he complied merely for the sake' of the blessed Constans, he
   ought to deal fairly by his brother, and make himself heir to his
   sentiments as well as to the Empire. But, although, when seeking to
   obtain his just rights, he deposed Vetranio, with the question, To whom
   does the inheritance belong after a brother's death [1675] ?' yet for
   the sake of the accursed heresy of the enemies of Christ, he disregards
   the claims of justice, and behaves undutifully towards his brethren.
   Nay, for the sake of this heresy, he would not consent to observe even
   his father's wishes without infringement; but, in what he may gratify
   these impious men, he pretends to adopt his intention, while in order
   to distress the others, he cares not to shew the reverence which is due
   unto a father. For in consequence of the calumnies of Eusebius and his
   fellows, his father sent the Bishop for a time into Gaul to avoid the
   cruelty of his persecutors (this was shewn by the blessed Constantine,
   the brother of the former, after their father's death, as appears by
   his letters [1676] ), but he would not be persuaded by Eusebius and his
   fellows to send the person whom they desired for a Bishop, but
   prevented the accomplishment of their wishes, and put a stop to their
   attempts with severe threats.

   51. How Constantius shews his respect for his father and brother.

   If therefore, as he declares in his letters, he desired to observe his
   sire's practice, why did he first send out Gregory, and now this
   George, the eater of stores [1677] ? Why does he endeavour so earnestly
   to introduce into the Church these Arians, whom his father named
   Porphyrians [1678] , and banish others while he patronises them?
   Although his father admitted Arius to his presence, yet when Arius
   perjured himself and burst asunder [1679] he lost the compassion of his
   father; who, on learning the truth, condemned him as an heretic. Why
   moreover, while pretending to respect the Canon of the Church, has he
   ordered the whole course of his conduct in opposition to them? For
   where is there a Canon that a Bishop should be appointed from Court?
   Where is there a Canon [1680] that permits soldiers to invade Churches?
   What tradition is there allowing counts and ignorant eunuchs to
   exercise authority in Ecclesiastical matters, and to make known by
   their edicts the decisions of those who bear the name of Bishops? He is
   guilty of all manner of falsehood for the sake of this unholy heresy.
   At a former time he sent out Philagrius as Prefect a second time [1681]
   , in opposition to the opinion of his father, and we see what has taken
   place now. Nor for his brother's sake' does he speak the truth. For
   after his death he wrote not once nor twice, but three times to the
   Bishop, and repeatedly promised him that he would not change his
   behaviour towards him, but exhorted him to be of good courage, and not
   suffer any one to alarm him, but to continue to abide in his Church in
   perfect security. He also sent his commands by Count Asterius, and
   Palladius the Notary, to Felicissimus, who was then Duke, and to the
   Prefect Nestorius, that if either Philip the Prefect, or any other
   should venture to form any plot against Athanasius, they should prevent
   it.

   52. The Emperor has no right to rule the Church.

   Wherefore when Diogenes came, and Syrianus laid in wait for us, both he
   and we [1682] and the people demanded to see the Emperor's letters,
   supposing that, as it is written, Let not a falsehood be spoken before
   the king [1683] ;' so when a king has made a promise, he will not lie,
   nor change. If then for his brother's sake he complied,' why did he
   also write those letters upon his death? And if he wrote them for his
   memory's sake,' why did he afterwards behave so very unkindly towards
   him, and persecute the man, and write what he did, alleging a judgment
   of Bishops, while in truth he acted only to please himself?
   Nevertheless his craft has not escaped detection, but we have the proof
   of it ready at hand. For if a judgment had been passed by Bishops, what
   concern had the Emperor with it? Or if it was only a threat of the
   Emperor, what need in that case was there of the so-named Bishops? When
   was such a thing heard of before from the beginning of the world? When
   did a judgment of the Church receive its validity from the Emperor? or
   rather when was his decree ever recognised by the Church? There have
   been many Councils held heretofore; and many judgments passed by the
   Church; but the Fathers never sought the consent of the Emperor
   thereto, nor did the Emperor busy himself with the affairs of the
   Church [1684] . The Apostle Paul had friends among them of CÃ¦sar's
   household, and in his Epistle to the Philippians he sent salutations
   from them; but he never took them as his associates in Ecclesiastical
   judgments. Now however we have witnessed a novel spectacle, which is a
   discovery of the Arian heresy. Heretics have assembled together with
   the Emperor Constantius, in order that he, alleging the authority of
   the Bishops, may exercise his power against whomsoever he pleases, and
   while he persecutes may avoid the name of persecutor; and that they,
   supported by the Emperor's government, may conspire the ruin of
   whomsoever they will [1685] and these are all such as are not as
   impious as themselves. One might look upon their proceedings as a
   comedy which they are performing on the stage, in which the pretended
   Bishops are actors, and Constantius the performer of their behests, who
   makes promises to them, as Herod did to the daughter of Herodias, and
   they dancing before him accomplish through false accusations the
   banishment and death of the true believers in the Lord.

   53. Despotic interference of Constantius.

   Who indeed has not been injured by their calumnies? Whom have not these
   enemies of Christ conspired to destroy? Whom has Constantius failed to
   banish upon charges which they have brought against them? When did he
   refuse to hear them willingly? And what is most strange, when did he
   permit any one to speak against them, and did not more readily receive
   their testimony, of whatever kind it might be? Where is there a Church
   which now enjoys the privilege of worshipping Christ freely? If a
   Church be a maintainer of true piety, it is in danger; if it dissemble,
   it abides in fear. Every place is full of hypocrisy and impiety, so far
   as he is concerned; and wherever there is a pious person and a lover of
   Christ (and there are many such everywhere, as were the prophets and
   the great Elijah) they hide themselves, if so be that they can find a
   faithful friend like Obadiah, and either they withdraw into caves and
   dens of the earth, or pass their lives in wandering about in the
   deserts. These men in their madness prefer such calumnies against them
   as Jezebel invented against Naboth, and the Jews against the Saviour;
   while the Emperor, who is the patron of the heresy, and wishes to
   pervert the truth, as Ahab wished to change the vineyard into a garden
   of herbs, does whatever they desire him to do, for the suggestions he
   receives from them are agreeable to his own wishes.

   54. Constantius gives up the Alexandrian Churches to the heretics.

   Accordingly he banished, as I said before the genuine Bishops, because
   they would not profess impious doctrines, to suit his own pleasure; and
   so he now sent Count Heraclius to proceed against Athanasius, who has
   publicly made known his decrees, and announced the command of the
   Emperor to be, that unless they complied with the instructions
   contained in his letters, their bread [1686] should be taken away,
   their idols overthrown, and the persons of many of the city-magistrates
   and people delivered over to certain slavery. After threatening them in
   this manner, he was not ashamed to declare publicly with a loud voice,
   The Emperor disclaims Athanasius, and has commanded that the Churches
   be given up to the Arians.' And when all wondered to hear this, and
   made signs to one another, exclaiming, What! has Constantius become a
   heretic?' instead of blushing as he ought, the man all the more obliged
   the senators and heathen magistrates and wardens [1687] of the idol
   temples to subscribe to these conditions, and to agree to receive as
   their Bishop whomsoever [1688] the Emperor should send them. Of course
   Constantius was strictly upholding the Canon of the Church, when he
   caused this to be done; when instead of requiring letters from the
   Church, he demanded them of the market-place, and instead of the people
   he asked them of the wardens of the temples. He was conscious that he
   was not sending a Bishop to preside over Christians, but a certain
   intruder for those who subscribed to his terms.

   55. Irruption into the great Church.

   The Gentiles accordingly, as purchasing by their compliance the safety
   of their idols, and certain of the trades [1689] , subscribed, though
   unwillingly, from fear of the threats which he had held out to them;
   just as if the matter had been the appointment of a general, or other
   magistrate. Indeed what as heathen, were they likely to do, except
   whatever was pleasing to the Emperor? But the people having assembled
   in the great Church (for it was the fourth day of the week), Count
   Heraclius on the following day [1690] takes with him Cataphronius the
   Prefect of Egypt, and Faustinus the Receiver-General [1691] , and
   Bithynus a heretic; and together they stir up the younger men of the
   common multitude [1692] who worshipped idols, to attack the Church, and
   stone the people, saying that such was the Emperor's command. As the
   time of dismissal however had arrived, the greater part had already
   left the Church, but there being a few women still remaining, they did
   as the men had charged them, whereupon a piteous spectacle ensued. The
   few women had just risen from prayer and had sat down when the youths
   suddenly came upon them naked with stones and clubs. Some of them the
   godless wretches stoned to death; they scourged with stripes the holy
   persons of the Virgins, tore off their veils and exposed their heads,
   and when they resisted the insult, the cowards kicked them with their
   feet. This was dreadful, exceedingly dreadful; but what ensued was
   worse, and more intolerable than any outrage. Knowing the holy
   character of the virgins, and that their ears were unaccustomed to
   pollution, and that they were better able to bear stones and swords
   than expressions of obscenity, they assailed them with such language.
   This the Arians suggested to the young men, and laughed at all they
   said and did; while the holy Virgins and other godly women fled from
   such words as they would from the bite of asps, but the enemies of
   Christ assisted them in the work, nay even, it may be, gave utterance
   to the same; for they were well-pleased with the obscenities which the
   youths vented upon them.

   56. The great Church pillaged.

   After this, that they might fully execute the orders they had received
   (for this was what they earnestly desired, and what the Count and the
   Receiver-General instructed them to do), they seized upon the seats,
   the throne, and the table which was of wood [1693] , and the curtains
   [1694] of the Church, and whatever else they were able, and carrying
   them out burnt them before the doors in the great street, and cast
   frankincense upon the flame. Alas! who will not weep to hear of these
   things, and, it may be, close his ears, that he may not have to endure
   the recital, esteeming it hurtful merely to listen to the account of
   such enormities? Moreover they sang the praises of their idols, and
   said, Constantius hath become a heathen, and the Arians have
   acknowledged our customs;' for indeed they scruple not even to pretend
   heathenism, if only their heresy may be established. They even were
   ready to sacrifice a heifer which drew the water for the gardens in the
   CÃ¦sareum [1695] ; and would have sacrificed it, had it not been a
   female [1696] ; for they said that it was unlawful for such to be
   offered among them.

   57. Thus acted the impious [1697] Arians in conjunction with the
   heathens, thinking that these things tended to our dishonour. But
   Divine justice reproved their iniquity, and wrought a great and
   remarkable sign, thereby plainly shewing to all men, that as in their
   acts of impiety they had dared to attack none other but the Lord, so in
   these proceedings also they were again attempting to do dishonour unto
   Him. This was more manifestly proved by the marvellous event which now
   came to pass. One of these licentious youths ran into the Church, and
   ventured to sit down upon the throne; and as he sat there the wretched
   man uttered with a nasal sound some lascivious song. Then rising up he
   attempted to pull away the throne, and to drag it towards him; he knew
   not that he was drawing down vengeance upon himself. For as of old the
   inhabitants of Azotus, when they ventured to touch [1698] the Ark,
   which it was not lawful for them even to look upon, were immediately
   destroyed by it, being first grievously tormented by emerods; so this
   unhappy person who presumed to drag the throne, drew it upon himself,
   and, as if Divine justice had sent the wood to punish him, he struck it
   into his own bowels; and instead of carrying out the throne, he brought
   out by his blow his own entrails; so that the throne took away his
   life, instead of his taking it away. For, as it is [1699] written of
   Judas, his bowels gushed out; and he fell down and was carried away,
   and the day after he died. Another also entered the Church with boughs
   of trees [1700] and, as in the Gentile manner he waved them in his
   hands and mocked, he was immediately struck with blindness, so as
   straightway to lose his sight, and to know no longer where he was; but
   as he was about to fall, he was taken by the hand and supported by his
   companions out of the place, and when on the following day he was with
   difficulty brought to his senses, he knew not either what he had done
   or suffered in consequence of his audacity.

   58. General Persecution at Alexandria.

   The Gentiles, when they beheld these things, were seized with fear, and
   ventured on no further outrage; but the Arians were not even yet
   touched with shame, but, like the Jews when they saw the miracles, were
   faithless and would not believe, nay, like Pharaoh, they were hardened;
   they too having placed their hopes below, on the Emperor and his
   eunuchs. They permitted the Gentiles, or rather the more abandoned of
   the Gentiles, to act in the manner before described; for they found
   that Faustinus, who is the Receiver-General by style, but is a vulgar
   [1701] person in habits, and profligate in heart, was ready to play his
   part with them in these proceedings, and to stir up the heathen. Nay,
   they undertook to do the like themselves, that as they had modelled
   their heresy upon all other heresies together [1702] , so they might
   share their wickedness with the more depraved of mankind. What they did
   through the instrumentality of others I described above; the enormities
   they committed themselves surpass the bounds of all wickedness; and
   they exceed the malice of any hangman. Where is there a house which
   they did not ravage? where is there a family they did not plunder on
   pretence of searching for their opponents? where is there a garden they
   did not trample under foot? what tomb [1703] did they not open,
   pretending they were seeking for Athanasius, though their sole object
   was to plunder and spoil all that came in their way? How many men's
   houses were sealed up [1704] ! The contents of how many persons'
   lodgings did they give away to the soldiers who assisted them! Who had
   not experience of their wickedness? Who that met them but was obliged
   to hide himself in the market-place? Did not many an one leave his
   house from fear of them, and pass the night in the desert? Did not many
   an one, while anxious to preserve his property from them, lose the
   greater part of it? And who, however inexperienced of the sea, did not
   choose rather to commit himself to it, and to risk all its dangers,
   than to witness their threatenings? Many also changed their residences,
   and removed from street to street, and from the city to the suburbs.
   And many submitted to severe fines, and when they were unable to pay,
   borrowed of others, merely that they might escape their machinations.

   59. Violence of Sebastianus.

   For they made themselves formidable to all men, and treated all with
   great arrogance, using the name of the Emperor, and threatening them
   with his displeasure. They had to assist them in their wickedness the
   Duke Sebastianus, a Manichee, and a profligate young man; the [1705]
   Prefect, the Count, and the Receiver-General as a dissembler. Many
   Virgins who condemned their impiety, and professed the truth, they
   brought out from the houses; others they insulted as they walked along
   the streets, and caused their heads to be uncovered by their young men.
   They also gave permission to the females of their party to insult whom
   they chose; and although the holy and faithful women withdrew on one
   side, and gave them the way, yet they gathered round them like
   Bacchanals and Furies [1706] , and esteemed it a misfortune if they
   found no means to injure them, and spent that day sorrowfully on which
   they were unable to do them some mischief. In a word, so cruel and
   bitter were they against all, that all men called them hangmen,
   murderers, lawless, intruders, evil-doers, and by any other name rather
   than that of Christians.

   60. Martyrdom of Eutychius.

   Moreover, imitating the savage practices of Scythians, they seized upon
   Eutychius a Subdeacon, a man who had served the Church honourably, and
   causing him to be scourged on the back with a leather whip, till he was
   at the point of death, they demanded that her should be sent away to
   the mines; and not simply to any mine, but to that of PhÃ¦no [1707] ,
   where even a condemned murderer is hardly able to live a few days. And
   what was most unreasonable in their conduct, they would not permit him
   even a few hours to have his wounds dressed, but caused him to be sent
   off immediately, saying, If this is done, all men will be afraid, and
   henceforward will be on our side.' After a short interval, however,
   being unable to accomplish his journey to the mine on account of the
   pain of his stripes, he died on the way. He perished rejoicing, having
   obtained the glory of martyrdom. But the miscreants were not even yet
   ashamed, but in the words of Scripture, having bowels without mercy
   [1708] ,' they acted accordingly, and now again perpetrated a satanic
   deed. When the people prayed them to spare Eutychius and besought them
   for him, they caused four honourable and free citizens to be seized,
   one of whom was Hermias who washed the beggars' feet [1709] ; and after
   scourging them very severely, the Duke cast them into the prison. But
   the Arians, who are more cruel even than Scythians, when they had seen
   that they did not die from the stripes they had received, complained of
   the Duke and threatened, saying, We will write and tell the eunuchs
   [1710] , that he does not flog as we wish.' Hearing this he was afraid,
   and was obliged to beat the men a second time; and they being beaten,
   and knowing for what cause they suffered and by whom they had been
   accused, said only, We are beaten for the sake of the Truth, but we
   will not hold communion with the heretics: beat us now as thou wilt;
   God will judge thee for this.' The impious men wished to expose them to
   danger in the prison, that they might die there; but the people of God
   observing their time, besought him for them, and after seven days or
   more they were set at liberty.

   61. Ill-treatment of the poor.

   But the Arians, as being grieved at this, again devised another yet
   more cruel and unholy deed; cruel in the eyes of all men, but well
   suited to their antichristian heresy. The Lord commanded that we should
   remember the poor; He said, Sell that ye have, and give alms' and again
   I was a hungred, and ye gave Me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave Me
   drink; for inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of these little ones,
   ye have done it unto Me [1711] .' But these men, as being in truth
   opposed to Christ, have presumed to act contrary to His will in this
   respect also. For when the Duke gave up the Churches to the Arians, and
   the destitute persons and widows were unable to continue any longer in
   them, the widows sat down in places which the Clergy entrusted with the
   care of them appointed. And when the Arians saw that the brethren
   readily ministered unto them and supported them, they persecuted the
   widows also, beating them on the feet, and accused those who gave to
   them before the Duke. This was done by means of a certain soldier named
   Dynamius. And it was well-pleasing to Sebastian [1712] , for there is
   no mercy in the ManichÃ¦ans; nay, it is considered a hateful thing among
   them to shew mercy to a poor man [1713] . Here then was a novel subject
   of complaint; and a new kind of court now first invented by the Arians.
   Persons were brought to trial for acts of kindness which they had
   performed; he who shewed mercy was accused, and he who had received a
   benefit was beaten; and they wished rather that a poor man should
   suffer hunger, than that he who was willing to shew mercy should give
   to him. Such sentiments these modern Jews, for such they are, have
   learned from the Jews of old, who when they saw him who had been blind
   from his birth recover his sight, and him who had been a long time sick
   of the palsy made whole, accused [1714] the Lord who had bestowed these
   benefits upon them, and judged them to be transgressors who had
   experienced His goodness [1715] .

   62. Ill-treatment of the poor.

   Who was not struck with astonishment at these proceedings? Who did not
   execrate both the heresy, and its defenders? Who failed to perceive
   that the Arians are indeed more cruel than wild beasts? For they had no
   prospect of gain [1716] from their iniquity, for the sake of which they
   might have acted in this manner; but they rather increased the hatred
   of all men against themselves. They thought by treachery and terror to
   force certain persons into their heresy, so that they might be brought
   to communicate with them; but the event turned out quite the contrary.
   The sufferers endured as martyrdom whatever they inflicted upon them,
   and neither betrayed nor denied the true faith in Christ. And those who
   were without and witnessed their conduct, and at last even the heathen,
   when they saw these things, execrated them as antichristian, as cruel
   executioners; for human nature is prone to pity and sympathise with the
   poor. But these men have lost even the common sentiments of humanity;
   and that kindness which they would have desired to meet with at the
   hands of others, had themselves been sufferers, they would not permit
   others to receive, but employed against them the severity and authority
   of the magistrates, and especially of the Duke.

   63. Ill-treatment of the Presbyters and Deacons.

   What they have done to the Presbyters and Deacons; how they drove them
   into banishment under sentence passed upon them by the Duke and the
   magistrates, causing the soldiers to bring out their kinsfolk from the
   houses [1717] , and Gorgonius, the commander of the police [1718] to
   beat them with stripes; and how (most cruel act of all) with much
   insolence they plundered the loaves [1719] of these and of those who
   were now dead; these things it is impossible for words to describe, for
   their cruelty surpasses all the powers of language. What terms could
   one employ which might seem equal to the subject? What circumstances
   could one mention first, so that those next recorded would not be found
   more dreadful, and the next more dreadful still? All their attempts and
   iniquities [1720] were full of murder and impiety; and so unscrupulous
   and artful are they, that they endeavour to deceive by promises of
   protection, and by bribing with money [1721] , that so, since they
   cannot recommend themselves by fair means, they may thereby make some
   display to impose on the simple.

   Part VIII.

   Persecution in Egypt.

   64. Who would call them even by the name of Gentiles; much less by that
   of Christians? Would any one regard their habits and feelings as human,
   and not rather those of wild beasts, seeing their cruel and savage
   conduct? They are more worthless than public hangmen; more audacious
   than all other heretics. To the Gentiles they are much inferior, and
   stand far apart and separate from them [1722] . I have heard from our
   fathers, and I believe their report to be a faithful one, that long
   ago, when a persecution arose in the time [1723] of Maximian, the
   grandfather of Constantius, the Gentiles concealed our brethren the
   Christians, who were sought after, and frequently suffered the loss of
   their own substance, and had trial of imprisonment, solely that they
   might not betray the fugitives. They protected those who fled to them
   for refuge, as they would have done their own persons, and were
   determined to run all risks on their behalf. But now these admirable
   persons, the inventors of a new heresy, act altogether the contrary
   part; and are distinguished for nothing but their treachery. They have
   appointed themselves as executioners, and seek to betray all alike, and
   make those who conceal others the objects of their plots, esteeming
   equally as their enemy both him that conceals and him that is
   concealed. So murderous are they; so emulous in their evil-doings of
   the wickedness of Judas.

   65. Martyrdom of Secundus of Barka.

   The crimes these men have committed cannot adequately be described. I
   would only say, that as I write and wish to enumerate all their deeds
   of iniquity, the thought enters my mind, whether this heresy be not the
   fourth daughter of the horse-leach [1724] in the Proverbs, since after
   so many acts of injustice, so many murders, it hath not yet said, It is
   enough.' No; it still rages, and goes about [1725] seeking after those
   whom it has not yet discovered, while those whom it has already
   injured, it is eager to injure anew. After the night attack, after the
   evils committed in consequence of it, after the persecution brought
   about by Heraclius, they cease not yet to accuse us falsely before the
   Emperor (and they are confident that as impious persons they will
   obtain a hearing), desiring that something more than banishment may be
   inflicted upon us, and that hereafter those who do not consent to their
   impieties may be destroyed. Accordingly, being now emboldened in an
   extreme degree, that most abandoned Secundus [1726] of Pentapolis, and
   Stephanus [1727] his accomplice, conscious that their heresy was a
   defence of any injustice they might commit, on discovering a Presbyter
   at Barka who would not comply with their desires (he was called
   Secundus, being of the same name, but not of the same faith with the
   heretic), they kicked him till he died [1728] . While he was thus
   suffering he imitated the Saint, and said, Let no one avenge my cause
   before human judges; I have the Lord for my avenger, for whose sake I
   suffer these things at their hands.' They however were not moved with
   pity at these words, nor did they feel any awe of the sacred season;
   for it was during the time of Lent [1729] that they thus kicked the man
   to death.

   66. Persecution the weapon of Arianism.

   O new heresy, that hast put on the whole devil in impiety and wicked
   deeds! For in truth it is but a lately invented evil; and although
   certain heretofore appear to have adopted its doctrines, yet they
   concealed them, and were not known to hold them. But Eusebius and
   Arius, like serpents coming out of their holes, have vomited forth the
   poison of this impiety; Arius daring to blasphemy openly, and [1730]
   Eusebius defending his blasphemy. He was not however able to support
   the heresy, until, as I said before, he found a patron [1731] for it in
   the Emperor. Our fathers called an Ecumenical Council, when three
   hundred of them, more or less [1732] , met together and condemned the
   Arian heresy, and all declared that it was alien and strange to the
   faith of the Church. Upon this its supporters, perceiving that they
   were dishonoured, and had now no good ground of argument to insist
   upon, devised a different method, and attempted to vindicate it by
   means of external power. And herein one may especially admire the
   novelty as well as wickedness of their device, and how they go beyond
   all other heresies. For these support their madness by persuasive
   arguments calculated to deceive the simple; the Greeks, as the Apostle
   has said, make their attack with excellency and persuasiveness of
   speech, and with plausible fallacies; the Jews, leaving the divine
   Scriptures, now, as the Apostle again has said, contend about fables
   and endless genealogies [1733] ;' and the Manichees and Valentinians
   with them, and others, corrupting the divine Scriptures, put forth
   fables in terms of their own inventions. But the Arians are bolder than
   them all, and have shewn that the other heresies are but their younger
   sisters [1734] , whom, as I have said, they surpass in impiety,
   emulating them all, and especially the Jews in their iniquity. For as
   the Jews, when they were unable to prove the charges which they
   pretended to allege against Paul, straightway led him to the chief
   captain and the governor; so likewise these men, who surpass the Jews
   in their devices, make use only of the power of the judges; and if any
   one so much as speaks against them, he is dragged before the Governor
   or the General.

   67. Arianism worse than other heresies, because of Persecution.

   The other heresies also, when the very Truth has refuted them on the
   clearest evidence, are wont to be silent, being simply confounded by
   their conviction. But this modern and accursed heresy, when it is
   overthrown by argument, when it is cast down and covered with shame by
   the very Truth, forthwith endeavours to coerce by violence and stripes
   and imprisonment those whom it has been unable to persuade by argument,
   thereby acknowledging itself to be anything rather than godly. For it
   is the part of true godliness not to compel [1735] , but to persuade,
   as I said before. Thus our Lord Himself, not as employing force, but as
   offering to their free choice, has said to all, If any man will follow
   after Me [1736] ;' and to His disciples, Will ye also go away [1737] ?'
   This heresy, however, is altogether alien from godliness; and therefore
   how otherwise should it act, than contrary to our Saviour, seeing also
   that it has enlisted that enemy of Christ, Constantius, as it were
   Antichrist himself [1738] , to be its leader in impiety? He for its
   sake has earnestly endeavoured to emulate Saul in savage cruelty. For
   when the priests gave victuals to David, Saul commanded, and they were
   all destroyed, in number three hundred and five [1739] ; and this man,
   now that all avoid the heresy, and confess a sound faith in the Lord,
   annuls a Council of full three hundred Bishops, banishes the Bishops
   themselves, and hinders the people from the practice of piety, and from
   their prayers to God, preventing their public assemblies. And as Saul
   overthrew Nob, the city of the priests, so this man, advancing even
   further in wickedness, has given up the Churches to the impious. And as
   he honoured Doeg the accuser before the true priests, and persecuted
   David, giving ear to the Ziphites; so this man prefers heretics to the
   godly, and still persecutes them that flee from him, giving ear to his
   own eunuchs, who falsely accuse the orthodox. He does not perceive that
   whatever he does or writes in behalf of the heresy of the Arians,
   involves an attack [1740] upon the Saviour.

   68. Constantius worse than Saul, Ahab, and Pilate. His past conduct to
   his own relations.

   Ahab himself did not act so cruelly towards the priests of God, as this
   man has acted towards the Bishops. For he was at least pricked in his
   conscience, when Naboth had been murdered, and was afraid at the sight
   [1741] of Elijah, but this man neither reverenced the great Hosius, nor
   was wearied or pricked in conscience, after banishing so many Bishops;
   but like another Pharaoh, the more he is afflicted, the more he is
   hardened, and imagines greater wickedness day by day. And the most
   extraordinary instance of his iniquity was the following. It happened
   that when the Bishops were condemned to banishment, certain other
   persons also received their sentence on charges of murder or sedition
   or theft, each according to the quality of his offence. These men after
   a few months he released, on being requested to do so, as Pilate did
   Barabbas; but the servants of Christ he not only refused to set at
   liberty, but even sentenced them to more unmerciful punishment in the
   place of their exile, proving himself an undying evil [1742] ' to them.
   To the others through congeniality of disposition he became a friend;
   but to the orthodox he was an enemy on account of their true faith in
   Christ. Is it not clear to all men from hence, that the Jews of old
   when they demanded Barabbas, and crucified the Lord, acted but the part
   which these present enemies of Christ are acting together with
   Constantius? nay, that he is even more bitter than Pilate. For Pilate,
   when he perceived [1743] the injustice of the deed, washed his hands;
   but this man, while he banishes the saints, gnashes his teeth against
   them more and more.

   69. But what wonder is it if, after he has been led into impious
   errors, he is so cruel towards the Bishops, since the common feelings
   of humanity could not induce him to spare even his own kindred. His
   uncles [1744] he slew; his cousins he put out of the way; he
   commiserated not the sufferings of his father-in-law, though he had
   married his daughter, or of his kinsmen; but he has ever been a
   transgressor of his oaths towards all. So likewise he treated his
   brother in an unholy manner; and now he pretends to build his
   sepulchre, although he delivered up to the barbarians his betrothed
   wife Olympias, whom his brother had protected till his death, and had
   brought up as his intended consort. Moreover he attempted to set aside
   his wishes, although he boasts to be his heir [1745] ; for so he
   writes, in terms which any one possessed of but a small measure of
   sense would be ashamed of. But when I compare his letters, I find that
   he does not possess common understanding, but that his mind is solely
   regulated by the suggestions of others, and that he has no mind of his
   own at all. Now Solomon says, If a ruler hearken to lies, all his
   servants are wicked [1746] .' This man proves by his actions that he is
   such an unjust one, and that those about him are wicked.

   70. Inconstancy of Constantius.

   How then, being such an one, and taking pleasure in such associates,
   can he ever design anything just or reasonable, entangled as he is in
   the iniquity of his followers, men who verily bewitch him, or rather
   who have trampled his brains under their heels? Wherefore he now writes
   letters [1747] , and then repents that he has written them, and after
   repenting is again stirred up to anger, and then again laments his
   fate, and being undetermined what to do, he shews a soul destitute of
   understanding. Being then of such a character, one must fairly pity
   him, because that under the semblance and name of freedom he is the
   slave of those who drag him on to gratify their own impious pleasure.
   In a word, while through his folly and inconstancy, as the Scripture
   saith [1748] , he is willing to comply with the desires of others, he
   has given himself up to condemnation, to be consumed by fire in the
   future judgment; at once consenting to do whatever they wish, and
   gratifying them in their designs against the Bishops, and in their
   exertion of authority over the Churches. For behold, he has now again
   thrown into disorder all the Churches of Alexandria [1749] and of Egypt
   and Libya, and has publicly given orders, that the Bishops of the
   Catholic Church and faith be cast out of their churches, and that they
   be all given up to the professors of the Arian doctrines [1750] . The
   General began to carry this order into execution; and straightway
   Bishops were sent off in chains, and Presbyters and Monks bound with
   iron, after being almost beaten to death with stripes. Disorder
   prevails in every place; all Egypt and Libya are in danger, the people
   being indignant at this unjust command, and seeing in it the
   preparation for the coming of Antichrist, and beholding their property
   plundered by others, and given up into the hands of the heretics.

   71. This wickedness unprecedented.

   When was ever such iniquity heard of? when was such an evil deed ever
   perpetrated, even in times of persecution? They were heathens who
   persecuted formerly; but they did not bring their idols into the
   Churches. Zenobia [1751] , was a Jewess, and a supporter of Paul of
   Samosata; but she did not give up the Churches to the Jews for
   Synagogues. This is a new piece of iniquity. It is not simply
   persecution, but more than persecution, it is a prelude and preparation
   [1752] for the coming of Antichrist. Even if it be admitted that they
   invented false charges against Athanasius and the rest of the Bishops
   whom they banished, yet what is this to their later practices? What
   charges have they to allege against the whole of Egypt and Libya and
   Pentapolis [1753] ? For they have begun no longer to lay their plots
   against individuals, in which case they might be able to frame a lie
   against them; but they have set upon all in a body, so that if they
   merely choose to invent accusations against them, they must be
   condemned. Thus their wickedness has blinded their understanding [1754]
   ; and they have required, without any reason assigned, that the whole
   body of the Bishops shall be expelled, and thereby they shew that the
   charges they framed against Athanasius and the rest of the Bishops whom
   they banished were false, and invented for no other purpose than to
   support the accursed heresy of the Arian enemies of Christ. This is now
   no longer concealed, but has become most manifest to all men. He
   commanded Athanasius to be expelled out of the city, and gave up the
   Churches to them. And the Presbyters and Deacons that were with him,
   who had been appointed by Peter and Alexander, were also expelled and
   driven into banishment; and the real Arians, who not through any
   suspicions arising from circumstances, but on account of the heresy had
   been expelled at first together with Arius himself by the Bishop
   Alexander,--Secundus in Libya, in Alexandria Euzoius [1755] the
   ChananÃ¦an, Julius, Ammon, Marcus, IrenÃ¦us, Zosimus, and Sarapion
   surnamed Pelycon, and in Libya Sisinnius, and the younger men with him,
   associates in his impiety; these have obtained possession of the
   Churches.

   72. Banishment of Egyptian Bishops.

   And the General Sebastian wrote to the governors and military
   authorities in every place; and the true Bishops were persecuted, and
   those who professed impious doctrines were brought in in their stead.
   They banished Bishops who had grown old in orders, and had been many
   years in the Episcopate, having been ordained by the Bishop Alexander;
   Ammonius [1756] , Hermes, Anagamphus, and Marcus, they sent to the
   Upper Oasis; Muis, Psenosiris, Nilammon, Plenes, Marcus, and
   Athenodorus to Ammoniaca, with no other intention than that they should
   perish in their passage through the deserts. They had no pity on them
   though they were suffering from illness, and indeed proceeded on their
   journey with so much difficulty on account of their weakness, that they
   were obliged to be carried in litters, and their sickness was so
   dangerous that the materials for their burial accompanied them. One of
   them indeed died, but they would not even permit the body to be given
   up to his friends for interment. With the same purpose they banished
   also the Bishop Dracontius to the desert places about Clysma, Philo to
   Babylon, Adelphius to Psinabla in the Thebais, and the Presbyters
   Hierax and Dioscorus to Syene. They likewise drove into exile Ammonius,
   Agathus, AgathodÃ¦mon, Apollonius, Eulogius, Apollos, Paphnutius, Gaius,
   and Flavius, ancient Bishops, as also the Bishops Dioscorus, Ammonius,
   Heraclides, and Psais; some of whom they gave up to work in the
   stone-quarries, others they persecuted with an intention to destroy,
   and many others they plundered. They banished also forty of the laity,
   with certain virgins whom they had before exposed to the fire [1757] ;
   beating them so severely with rods taken from palm-trees, that after
   lingering five days some of them died, and others had recourse to
   surgical treatment on account of the thorns left in their limbs, from
   which they suffered torments worse than death [1758] . But what is most
   dreadful to the mind of any man of sound understanding, though
   characteristic of these miscreants, is this: When the virgins during
   the scourging called upon the Name of Christ, they gnashed their teeth
   against them with increased fury. Nay more, they would not give up the
   bodies of the dead to their friends for burial, but concealed them that
   they might appear to be ignorant of the murder. They did not however
   escape detection; the whole city perceived it, and all men withdrew
   from them as executioners, as malefactors and robbers. Moreover they
   overthrew monasteries, and endeavoured to cast monks into the fire;
   they plundered houses, and breaking into the house of certain free
   citizens where the Bishop had deposited a treasure, they plundered and
   took it away. They scourged the widows on the soles of their feet, and
   hindered them from receiving their alms.

   73. Character of Arian nominees.

   Such were the iniquities practised by the Arians; and as to their
   further deeds of impiety, who could hear the account of them without
   shuddering? They had caused these venerable old men and aged Bishops to
   be sent into banishment; they now appointed in their stead profligate
   heathen youths, whom they thought to raise at once to the highest
   dignity, though they were not even Catechumens [1759] . And others who
   were accused of bigamy [1760] , and even of worse crimes, they
   nominated Bishops on account of the wealth and civil power which they
   possessed, and sent them out as it were from a market, upon their
   giving them gold. And now more dreadful calamities befel the people.
   For when they rejected these mercenary dependents of the Arians, so
   alien from themselves, they were scourged, they were proscribed, they
   were shut up in prison by the General (who did all this readily, being
   a Manichee), in order that they might no longer seek after their own
   Bishops, but be forced to accept those whom they abominated, men who
   were now guilty of the same mockeries as they had before practised
   among their idols.

   74. The Episcopal appointments of Constantius a mark of Antichrist.

   Will not every just person break forth into lamentations at the sight
   or hearing of these things, at perceiving the arrogance and extreme
   injustice of these impious men? The righteous lament in the place of
   the impious [1761] .' After all these things, and now that the impiety
   has reached such a pitch of audacity, who will any longer venture to
   call this Costyllius [1762] a Christian, and not rather the image of
   Antichrist? For what mark of Antichrist is yet wanting? How can he in
   any way fail to be regarded as that one? or how can the latter fail to
   be supposed such a one as he is? Did not the Arians and the Gentiles
   offer those sacrifices in the great Church in the CÃ¦sareum [1763] , and
   utter their blasphemies against Christ as by His command? And does not
   the vision of Daniel thus describe [1764] Antichrist; that he shall
   make war with the saints, and prevail against them, and exceed all that
   have been before him in evil deeds and shall humble three kings, and
   speak words against the Most High, and shall think to change times and
   laws? Now what other person besides Constantius has ever attempted to
   do these things? He is surely such a one as Antichrist would be. He
   speaks words against the Most High by supporting this impious heresy:
   he makes war against the saints by banishing the Bishops; although
   indeed he exercises this power but for a little while [1765] to his own
   destruction. Moreover he has surpassed those before him in wickedness,
   having devised a new mode of persecution; and after he had overthrown
   three kings, namely Vetranio, Magnentius, and Gallus, he straightway
   undertook the patronage of impiety; and like a giant [1766] he has
   dared in his pride to set himself up against the Most High. He has
   thought to change laws, by transgressing the ordinance of the Lord
   given us through His Apostles, by altering the customs of the Church,
   and inventing a new kind of appointments. For he sends from strange
   places, distant a fifty days' journey [1767] , Bishops attended by
   soldiers to people unwilling to receive them; and instead of an
   introduction to the acquaintance of their people, they bring with them
   threatening messages and letters to the magistrates. Thus he sent
   Gregory from Cappadocia [1768] to Alexandria; he transferred Germinius
   from Cyzicus to Sirmium; he removed Cecropius from Laodicea to
   Nicomedia.

   75. Arrival of George at Alexandria, and proceedings of Constantius in
   Italy.

   Again he transferred from Cappadocia to Milan one Auxentius [1769] , an
   intruder rather than a Christian, whom he commanded to stay there,
   after he had banished for his piety towards Christ Dionysius the Bishop
   of the place, a godly man. But this person was as yet even ignorant of
   the Latin language, and unskilful in everything except impiety. And now
   one George, a Cappadocian, who was contractor of stores [1770] at
   Constantinople, and having embezzled all monies that he received, was
   obliged to fly, he commanded to enter Alexandria with military pomp,
   and supported by the authority of the General. Next, finding one
   Epictetus [1771] a novice, a bold young man, he loved him [1772] ,
   perceiving that he was ready for wickedness; and by his means he
   carries on his designs against those of the Bishops whom he desires to
   ruin. For he is prepared to do everything that the Emperor wishes; who
   accordingly availing himself of his assistance, has committed at Rome a
   strange act, but one truly resembling the malice of Antichrist. Having
   made preparations in the Palace instead of the Church, and caused some
   three of his own eunuchs to attend instead of the people, he then
   compelled three [1773] ill-conditioned spies [1774] (for one cannot
   call them Bishops), to ordain forsooth as Bishop one Felix [1775] , a
   man worthy of them, then in the Palace. For the people perceiving the
   iniquitous proceedings of the heretics would not allow them to enter
   the Churches [1776] , and withdrew themselves far from them.

   76. Tyrannous banishment of Bishops by Constantius.

   Now what is yet wanting to make him Antichrist? or what more could
   Antichrist do at his coming than this man has done? Will he not find
   when he comes that the way has been already prepared for him by this
   man easily to deceive the people? Again [1777] , he claims to himself
   the right of deciding causes, which he refers to the Court instead of
   the Church, and presides at them in person. And strange it is to say,
   when he perceives the accusers at a loss, he takes up the accusation
   himself, so that the injured party may no longer be able to defend
   himself on account of the violence which he displays. This he did in
   the proceedings against Athanasius. For when he saw the boldness of the
   Bishops Paulinus, Lucifer, Eusebius, and Dionysius, and how out of the
   recantation of Ursacius and Valens [1778] they confuted those who spoke
   against the Bishop, and advised that Valens and his fellows should no
   longer be believed, since they had already retracted what they now
   asserted, he immediately stood up [1779] and said, I am now the accuser
   of Athanasius; on my account you must believe what these assert.' And
   then, when they said,--But how can you be an accuser, when the accused
   person is not present? for if you are his accuser, yet he is not
   present, and therefore cannot be tried. And the cause is not one that
   concerns Rome, so that you should be believed as being the Emperor; but
   it is a matter that concerns a Bishop; for the trial ought to be
   conducted on equal terms both to the accuser and the accused. And
   besides, how can you accuse him? for you could not be present to
   witness the conduct of one who lived at so great a distance from you;
   and if you speak but what you have heard from these, you ought also to
   give credit to what he says; but if you will not believe him, while you
   do believe them, it is plain that they assert these things for your
   sake, and accuse Athanasius only to gratify you?'--when he heard this,
   thinking that what they had so truly spoken was an insult to himself,
   he sent them into banishment; and being exasperated against Athanasius,
   he wrote in a more savage strain, requiring that he should suffer what
   has now befallen him, and that the Churches should be given up to the
   Arians, and that they should be allowed to do whatever they pleased.

   77. Constantius the precursor of Antichrist.

   Terrible indeed, and worse than terrible are such proceedings; yet
   conduct suitable to him who assumes the character of Antichrist. Who
   that beheld him taking the lead of his pretended Bishops, and presiding
   in Ecclesiastical causes, would not justly exclaim that this was the
   abomination of desolation [1780] ' spoken of by Daniel? For having put
   on the profession of Christianity, and entering into the holy places,
   and standing therein, he lays waste the Churches, transgressing their
   Canons, and enforcing the observance of his own decrees. Will any one
   now venture to say that this is a peaceful time with Christians, and
   not a time of persecution? A persecution indeed, such as never arose
   before, and such as no one perhaps will again stir up, except the son
   of lawlessness [1781] ,' do these enemies of Christ exhibit, who
   already present a picture of him in their own persons. Wherefore it
   especially behoves us to be sober, lest this heresy which has reached
   such a height of impudence, and has diffused itself abroad like the
   poison of an adder [1782] ,' as it is written in the Proverbs, and
   which teaches doctrines contrary to the Saviour; lest, I say, this be
   that falling away [1783] ,' after which He shall be revealed, of whom
   Constantius is surely the forerunner [1784] . Else wherefore is he so
   mad against the godly? wherefore does he contend for it as his own
   heresy, and call every one his enemy who will not comply with the
   madness of Arius, and admit gladly the allegations of the enemies of
   Christ, and dishonour so many venerable Councils? why did he command
   that the Churches should be given up to the Arians? was it not that,
   when that other comes, he may thus find a way to enter into them, and
   may take to himself him who has prepared those places for him? For the
   ancient Bishops who were ordained by Alexander, and by his predecessor
   Achillas, and by Peter before him, have been cast out; and those
   introduced whom the companions of soldiers nominated; and they
   nominated only such as promised to adopt their doctrines.

   78. Alliance of Meletians with Arians.

   This was an easy proposition for the Meletians to comply with; for the
   greater part, or rather the whole of them, have never had a religious
   education, nor are they acquainted with the sound faith [1785] ' in
   Christ, nor do they know at all what Christianity is, or what writings
   we Christians possess. For having come out, some of them from the
   worship of idols, and others from the senate, or from the first civil
   offices, for the sake of the miserable exemption [1786] from duty and
   for the patronage they gained, and having bribed [1787] the Meletians
   who preceded them, they have been advanced to this dignity even before
   they had been under instruction. And even if they pretended to have
   been such, yet what kind of instruction is to be obtained among the
   Meletians? But indeed without even pretending to be under instruction,
   they came at once, and immediately were called Bishops, just as
   children receive a name. Being then persons of this description, they
   thought the thing of no great consequence, nor even supposed that piety
   was different from impiety. Accordingly from being Meletians they
   readily and speedily became Arians; and if the Emperor should command
   them to adopt any other profession, they are ready to change again to
   that also. Their ignorance of true godliness quickly brings them to
   submit to the prevailing folly, and that which happens to be first
   taught them. For it is nothing to them to be carried about by every
   wind [1788] and tempest, so long as they are only exempt from duty, and
   obtain the patronage of men; nor would they scruple probably to change
   again [1789] to what they were before, even to become such as they were
   when they were heathens. Any how, being men of such an easy temper, and
   considering the Church as a civil senate, and like heathen being
   idolatrously minded, they put on the honourable name [1790] of the
   Saviour, under which they polluted the whole of Egypt, by causing so
   much as the name of the Arian heresy to be known therein. For Egypt has
   heretofore been the only country, throughout which the profession of
   the orthodox faith was boldly maintained [1791] ; and therefore these
   misbelievers have striven to introduce jealousy there also, or rather
   not they, but the devil who has stirred them up, in order that when his
   herald Antichrist shall come, he may find that the Churches in Egypt
   also are his own, and that the Meletians have already been instructed
   in his principles, and may recognise himself as already formed [1792]
   in them.

   79. Behaviour of the Meletians contrasted with that of the Alexandrian
   Christians.

   Such is the effect of that iniquitous order which was issued by
   Constantius. On the part of the people there was displayed a ready
   alacrity to submit to martyrdom, and an increased hatred of this most
   impious heresy; and yet lamentations for their Churches, and groans
   burst from all, while they cried unto the Lord, Spare Thy people, O
   Lord, and give not Thine heritage unto Thine enemies to reproach [1793]
   ;' but make haste to deliver us out of the hand of the lawless [1794] .
   For behold, they have not spared Thy servants, but are preparing the
   way for Antichrist.' For the Meletians will never resist him, nor will
   they care for the truth, nor will they esteem it an evil thing to deny
   Christ. They are men who have not approached the word with sincerity;
   like the chameleon [1795] they assume every various appearance; they
   are hirelings of any who will make use of them. They make not the truth
   their aim, but prefer before it their present pleasure; they say only,
   Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die [1796] .' Such a profession
   and faithless temper is more worthy of Epicritian [1797] players than
   of Meletians. But the faithful servants of our Saviour, and the true
   Bishops who believe with sincerity, and live not for themselves, but
   for the Lord; these faithfully believing in our Lord Jesus Christ, and
   knowing, as I said before, that the charges which were alleged against
   the truth were false, and plainly fabricated for the sake of the Arian
   heresy (for by the recantation [1798] of Ursacius and Valens they
   detected the calumnies which were devised against Athanasius, for the
   purpose of removing him out of the way, and of introducing into the
   Churches the impieties of the enemies of Christ); these, I say,
   perceiving all this, as defenders and preachers of the truth, chose
   rather, and endured to be insulted and driven into banishment, than to
   subscribe against him, and to hold communion with the Arian madmen.
   They forgot not the lessons they had taught to others; yea, they know
   well that great dishonour remains for the traitors, but for them which
   confess the truth, the kingdom of heaven; and that to the careless and
   such as fear Constantius will happen no good thing; but for them that
   endure tribulations here, as sailors reach a quiet haven after a storm,
   as wrestlers receive a crown after the combat, so these shall obtain
   great and eternal joy and delight in heaven;--such as Joseph obtained
   after those tribulations; such as the great Daniel had after his
   temptations and the manifold conspiracies of the courtiers against him;
   such as Paul now enjoys, being crowned by the Saviour; such as the
   people of God everywhere expect. They, seeing these things, were not
   infirm of purpose, but waxed strong in faith [1799] , and increased in
   their zeal more and more. Being fully persuaded of the calumnies and
   impieties of the heretics, they condemn the persecutor, and in heart
   and mind run together the same course with them that are persecuted,
   that they also may obtain the crown of Confession.

   80. Duty of separating from heretics.

   One might say much more against this detestable and antichristian
   heresy, and might demonstrate by many arguments that the practices of
   Constantius are a prelude to the coming of Antichrist. But seeing that,
   as the Prophet [1800] has said, from the feet even to the head there is
   no reasonableness in it, but it is full of all filthiness and all
   impiety, so that the very name of it ought to be avoided as a dog's
   vomit or the poison of serpents; and seeing that Costyllius openly
   exhibits the image of the adversary [1801] ; in order that our words
   may not be too many, it will be well to content ourselves with the
   divine Scripture, and that we all obey the precept which it has given
   us both in regard to other heresies, and especially respecting this.
   That precept is as follows; Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from
   thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of them, and be
   ye separate, that bear the vessels of the Lord [1802] .' This may
   suffice [1803] to instruct us all, so that if any one has been deceived
   by them, he may go out from them, as out of Sodom, and not return again
   unto them, lest he suffer the fate of Lot's wife; and if any one has
   continued from the beginning pure from this impious heresy, he may
   glory in Christ and say, We have not stretched out our hands to a
   strange god [1804] ; neither have we worshipped the works of our own
   hands, nor served the creature [1805] more than Thee, the God that hast
   created all things through Thy word, the Only-Begotten Son our Lord
   Jesus Christ, through whom to Thee the Father together with the same
   Word in the Holy Spirit be glory and power for ever and ever. Amen.'

   81. The Second Protest [1806] .

   The people of the Catholic Church in Alexandria, which is under the
   government of the most Reverend Bishop Athanasius, make this public
   protest by those whose names are under-written.

   We have already protested against the nocturnal assault which was
   committed upon ourselves and the Lord's house; although in truth there
   needed no protest in respect to proceedings with which the whole city
   has been already made acquainted. For the bodies of the slain which
   were discovered were exposed in public, and the bows and arrows and
   other arms found in the Lord's house loudly proclaim the iniquity.

   But whereas after our Protest already made, the most illustrious Duke
   Syrianus endeavours to force all men to agree with him, as though no
   tumult had been made, nor any had perished (wherein is no small proof
   that these things were not done according to the wishes of the most
   gracious Emperor Augustus Constantius; for he would not have been so
   much afraid of the consequences of this transaction, had he acted
   therein by command); and whereas also, when we went to him, and
   requested him not to do violence to any, nor to deny what had taken
   place, he ordered us, being Christians, to be beaten with clubs;
   thereby again giving proof of the nocturnal assault which has been
   directed against the Church:--

   We therefore make also this present Protest, certain of us being now
   about to travel to the most religious Emperor Augustus: and we adjure
   Maximus the Prefect of Egypt, and the Controllers [1807] , in the name
   of Almighty God, and for the sake of the salvation of the most
   religious Augustus Constantius, to relate all these things to the piety
   of Augustus, and to the authority of the most illustrious Prefects
   [1808] . We adjure also the masters of vessels, to publish these things
   everywhere, and to carry them to the ears of the most religious
   Augustus, and to the Prefects and the Magistrates in every place, in
   order that it may be known that a war has been waged against the
   Church, and that, in the times of Augustus Constantius, Syrianus has
   caused virgins and many others to become martyrs.

   As it dawned upon the fifth before the Ides of February [1809] , that
   is to say, the fourteenth of the month Mechir, while we were keeping
   vigil [1810] in the Lord's house, and engaged in our prayers (for there
   was to be a communion on the Preparation [1811] ); suddenly about
   midnight, the most illustrious Duke Syrianus attacked us and the Church
   with many legions of soldiers [1812] armed with naked swords and
   javelins and other warlike instruments, and wearing helmets on their
   heads; and actually while we were praying, and while the lessons were
   being read, they broke down the doors. And when the doors were burst
   open by the violence of the multitude, he gave command, and some of
   them were shooting; others shouting, their arms rattling, and their
   swords flashing in the light of the lamps; and forthwith virgins were
   being slain, many men trampled down, and falling over one another as
   the soldiers came upon them, and several were pierced with arrows and
   perished. Some of the soldiers also were betaking themselves to
   plunder, and were stripping the virgins, who were more afraid of being
   even touched by them than they were of death. The Bishop continued
   sitting upon his throne, and exhorted all to pray. The Duke led on the
   attack, having with him Hilarius the notary, whose part in the
   proceedings was shewn in the sequel. The Bishop was seized, and barely
   escaped being torn to pieces; and having fallen into a state of
   insensibility, and appearing as one dead, he disappeared from among
   them, and has gone we know not whither. They were eager to kill him.
   And when they saw that many had perished, they gave orders to the
   soldiers to remove out of sight the bodies of the dead. But the most
   holy virgins who were left behind were buried in the tombs, having
   attained the glory of martyrdom in the times of the most religious
   Constantius. Deacons also were beaten with stripes even in the Lord's
   house, and were shut up there.

   Nor did matters stop even here: for after all this had happened,
   whosoever pleased broke open any door that he could, and searched, and
   plundered what was within. They entered even into those places which
   not even all Christians are allowed to enter. Gorgonius, the commander
   of the city force [1813] , knows this, for he was present. And no
   unimportant evidence of the nature of this hostile assault is afforded
   by the circumstance, that the armour and javelins and swords borne by
   those who entered were left in the Lord's house. They have been hung up
   in the Church until this time, that they might not be able to deny it:
   and although they sent several times Dynamius the soldier [1814] , as
   well as the Commander [1815] of the city police, desiring to take them
   away, we would not allow it, until the circumstance was known to all.

   Now if an order has been given that we should be persecuted we are all
   ready to suffer martyrdom. But if it be not by order of Augustus, we
   desire Maximus the Prefect of Egypt and all the city magistrates to
   request of him that they may not again be suffered thus to assail us.
   And we desire also that this our petition may be presented to him, that
   they may not attempt to bring in hither any other Bishop: for we have
   resisted unto death [1816] , desiring to have the most Reverend
   Athanasius, whom God gave us at the beginning, according to the
   succession of our fathers; whom also the most religious Augustus
   Constantius himself sent to us with letters and oaths. And we believe
   that when his Piety is informed of what has taken place, he will be
   greatly displeased, and will do nothing contrary to his oaths, but will
   again give orders that our Bishop Athanasius shall remain with us.

   To the Consuls to be elected [1817] after the Consulship of the most
   illustrious ArbÃ¦thion and Collianus [1818] , on the seventeenth Mechir
   [1819] , which is the day before the Ides of February.

   [1735] The early theory about persecution seems to have been
   this,--that that was a bad cause which depended' upon it, but that,
   when a cause' was good, there was nothing wrong in using force in due
   subordination' to argument [so Pius IX. in Encycl. Quanta cura,' speaks
   of the 'officium coercendi sancitis poenis violatores catholicÃ¦
   religionis]; that there was as little impropriety in the civil
   magistrate's inducing individuals' by force, when they were incapable
   of higher motives, as by those secular blessings which follow on
   Christianity. Our Lord's kingdom was not of this world, that is, it did
   not depend on this world; but, as subduing, engrossing, and swaying
   this world, it at times condescended to make use of this world's
   weapons against itself. The simple question was whether a cause
   depended on force for its existence.' S. Athanasius declared and the
   event proved, that Arianism was so dependent. When Emperors ceased to
   persecute, Arianism ceased to be; it had no life in itself. Again, all
   cruel persecution, or long continued, or on a large scale, was wrong,
   as arguing an absence' of moral and rational grounds in the cause' so
   maintained. Again, there was an evident impropriety' in ecclesiastical
   functionaries using secular weapons, as there would be in their
   engaging in a secular pursuit, or forming secular connections; whereas
   the soldier might as suitably, and should as dutifully, defend religion
   with the sword, as the scholar with his pen. And further there was an
   abhorrence of cruelty natural to us, which it was a duty to cherish and
   maintain. All this being considered, there is no inconsistency in S.
   Athanasius denouncing persecution, and in Theodosius decreeing that the
   heretical teachers, who usurped the sacred titles of Bishops or
   Presbyters,' should be exposed to the heavy penalties of exile and
   confiscation.' Gibbon, Hist. ch. 27. For a list of passages from the

   Introduction to Four Discourses Against the Arians.

   ------------------------

   Written Between 356 And 360.

   There is no absolutely conclusive evidence as to the date of these
   Discourses, in fact they would appear from the language of ii. 1 to
   have been issued at intervals. The best judges, however, are agreed in
   assigning them to the fruitful period of the third exile.' The
   Discourses cannot indeed be identified with the lost account of the
   Arian heresy addressed to certain Egyptian monks (see Introd. to Arian
   Hist. supra); but the demand for such a treatise may have set
   Athanasius upon the composition of a more comprehensive refutation of
   the heresy. It was only at this period (Blasphemy' of Sirmium, 357)
   that the doctrinal controversy began to emerge from the mass of
   personalities and intrigues which had encumbered it for the first
   generation after the great Council; only now that the various parties
   were beginning to formulate their position; only now that the great
   mass of Eastern Conservatism' was beginning to see the nature of the
   issue as between the Nicene doctrine and the essential Arianism of its
   more resolute opponents. The situation seemed to clear, the time had
   come for gathering up the issues of the combat and striking a decisive
   blow. To this situation of affairs the treatise before us exactly
   corresponds. Characteristic of this period is the anxiety to conciliate
   and win over the so-called semi-Arians (of the type of Basil of Ancyra)
   who stumbled at the homoousion, but whose fundamental agreement with
   Athanasius was daily becoming more clear. Accordingly we find that
   Athanasius pointedly avoids the famous test word in these Discourses
   [1820] (with the exception of the fourth: see Orat. i. 20, note 5, 58,
   note 10: it only occurs i. 9, note 12, but see Orat. iv. 9, 12), and
   even adopts (not as fully adequate de Syn. 53, but as true so far as it
   goes), the semi-Arian' formula like in essence' (Or. i. 21, note 8, 20,
   26, iii. 26, he does not use the single compound word homoiousios: see
   further, Introd. to de Synodis). Although, therefore, demonstrative
   proof is lacking, there is tolerable certainty as to the date of our
   Discourses. And their purpose is no less manifest: they are a decisive
   blow of the kind described above, aimed at the very centre of the
   question, and calculated to sever the abnormal alliance between
   conservatives who really thought with Athanasius and men like Valens or
   Eudoxius, whose real convictions, so far as they had any, were Arian.
   Moreover they gather up all the threads of controversy against Arianism
   proper, refute its appeal to Scripture, and leave on record for all
   time the issues of the great doctrinal contest of the fourth century.
   They have naturally become, as Montfaucon observes, the mine whence
   subsequent defenders of the Divinity of our Redeemer have drawn their
   material. There are doubtless arguments which a modern writer would
   scarcely adopt (e.g. ii. 63, iii. 65 init., &c.), and the repeated
   labelling of the Arians as madmen (fanatics' in this translation),
   enemies of Christ, disciples of Satan, &c., &c., is at once tedious and
   by its very frequency unimpressive (see ii. 43 note 8 for Newman's
   famous list of animal nicknames). But the serious reader will pass
   sicco pede over such features, and will appreciate the richness,
   fulness, and versatility' of the use of Scripture, the steady grasp of
   certain primary truths, especially of the Divine Unity and of Christ's
   real or genuine natural and Divine Sonship (i. 15, ii. 2-5, 22, 23, 73,
   iii. 62), the keen penetration with which Arian objections are analysed
   (i. 14, 27, 29, ii. 26, iii. 59), Arian imputations disclaimed, Arian
   statements old and new, the bolder and the more cautious, compared,
   Arian evasions pointed out, Arian logic traced to its conclusions, and
   Arianism shewn to be inconsistent, irreverent' (Bright, Introd. p.
   lxviii.). Above all, we see in these Discourses what strikes us in all
   the writings of Athanasius from the de Incarnatione to the end, his
   firm hold of the Soteriological aspect of the question at issue, of its
   vital importance to the reality of Redemption and Grace, to the reality
   of the knowledge of God vouchsafed to sinful man in Christ (ii. 69, 70,
   cf. i. 35, 49, 50, ii. 67, &c., &c). The Theology and Christology of
   Athanasius is rooted in the idea of Redemption: our fellowship with
   God, our adoption as sons of God, would be unaccomplished, had not
   Christ imparted to us what was His Own to give (i. 12, 16, cf. Harnack,
   Dogmengesch., 2. 205). Among other points of interest we may observe
   the anticipatory rejection of the later heresies of Macedonius (i. 48,
   iii. 24), Nestorius (ii. 8 note 3, &c., and the frequent application of
   theotokos to the B.M.V. iii. 14, 29, &c.), and Eutyches (ii. 10 note 6,
   &c.), the emphatic vindication of worship as the exclusive prerogative
   of Divinity (ii. 23, iii. 32, we invoke no creature') and of the unique
   sinless conception of Christ (iii. 33), lastly the cautious and
   reasonable discussion (iii. 42 sqq.) of our Saviour's human knowledge.

   Although apparently composed at different times (see above) the four
   Discourses' form a single work. The fourth alone ends with the usual
   doxology, thus announcing itself as the conclusion of the four-fold
   treatise. At the same time, the relation of the fourth Discourse to the
   others is by no means clear. It is largely occupied with a polemic
   against a heresy at the opposite extreme from Arianism, Monarchianism
   in one or other of its forms. Newman, in his introductory excursus,
   expresses the opinion that it consists of a series of fragmentary notes
   against several heresies, which for some unknown reason came to be
   incorporated, possibly by Athanasius himself or by his secretaries, in
   the great anti-Arian Manifesto. Zahn Marcell. pp. 198-208 shews
   convincingly that the system of Marcellus, either in itself or in its
   supposed logical consequences, is the main object of criticism all
   along. If we trace throughout the Discourses the purpose of
   conciliating the Conservative' and Semi-Arian party, we can well
   understand that Athanasius may have appended to them a section directed
   against Monarchianism, which, in the persons of Marcellus and Photinus
   (whose names, however, are characteristically absent), must have been
   felt by him to be a legitimate stumbling-block in their path toward
   peace. At any rate the fourth oration has always been associated with
   the others as forming part of one work.

   There is, however, some confusion in early citations, in mss., and in
   early editions as to the number of Orations' against the Arians. The
   confusion is due to the frequent practice of reckoning the Ep. Ã†g. as
   the first (or in one or two cases as the fourth; the Basel ms. counts
   de Incar. c. Ar. as the fifth, and our fourth as the sixth). Montfaucon
   (Monitum Migne xxvi. p. 10) ascribes this to the arrangement in many
   mss. by which the Ep. Ã†g. comes immediately before the Orations.' Being
   itself directed against the Arians it has come to be labelled logos
   protos

   The title Orations' is consecrated by long use, and cannot be
   displaced, but it is unfortunate as implying, to our ears, oratorical
   delivery, for which the Discourses were never meant. The original Greek
   term (logos) is common to these Discourses with the c. Gentes, de
   Incarnatione, &c., &c.

   A full analysis of these Discourses is given by Bishop Kaye (Council of
   NicÃ¦a, in Works,' vol. v.); his strictures on Newman's notes are
   occasionally very just. The Discourses are more concisely analysed by
   Ceillier (vol. v., pp. 218, sqq.) See also Dorner, Doctr. of Person of
   Christ, Part I., Div. 3, i. 3. The headings of Newman, prefixed to the
   chapters,' will supply the place of an analysis for readers of this
   volume.

   The translation which follows is that of Cardinal Newman, published in
   1844 (the year before his secession), in the Oxford Library of the
   Fathers.' The copious and elaborate notes and discussions which
   accompany it have always been acknowledged to be a masterpiece of their
   illustrious author. The modern reader sits down to study Athanasius,
   and rises from his task filled with Newman. Like all the work of Newman
   included in this volume, translation and notes alike have been touched
   by the present editor with a reverent and a sparing hand. The
   translation, which shews great care and fidelity, coupled with
   remarkable ingenuity and close study of characteristic phrases and
   idioms, has been, with two main exceptions, but little altered. These
   exceptions are (1) the substitution throughout of essence' for
   substance,' (2) an attempt to remedy the most unfortunate, though not
   unconsidered, confusion of gennetos and genetos under the single
   rendering generate.' A good rendering for the latter word and its
   cognates is indeed not easy to find (see above, p. 149); but it was
   felt impossible, even in deference to so great a name, after the note
   in Lightfoot's Ignatius, to leave the matter as it stood.

   With regard to the notes, the historical matter and the abundant cross
   references have been thoroughly overhauled and in some cases modified
   without indication of the change. Moreover, some theological notes of
   minor importance have been expunged to economise space, while for the
   same reason, mere references have in many cases been reluctantly
   substituted for the extensive patristic quotations. The notes to Orat.
   iv., which are less important theologically, have been very much
   curtailed. With these exceptions, all doctrinal notes proper have been
   left exactly as they first appeared, even where they maintain views
   which appear untenable: any additions or explanations by the present
   editor are enclosed in square brackets, which also in a very few cases
   denote additional or corrected references made under Dr. Pusey's
   authority in the reprint of 1877.

   It is necessary to apologise to the reader for the hesitation which has
   been felt in touching, even to this slight extent, the work of John
   Henry Newman. The only apology which the editor of this volume cares to
   offer is for having done the little that seemed absolutely needed.

   It may be added that the Cardinal published in 1881 (4th ed., 1888) a
   free translation' of the first three Discourses, based upon the Oxford
   translation, but of a totally different kind, amounting to a somewhat
   highly condensed paraphrase of the original in the luminous English of
   the Cardinal himself, rather than bound, as the older translation is,
   to the style of Athanasius. The new rendering includes the de Decretis
   and the de Synodis; almost all the notes are in a second volume.

   The most convenient edition of the Greek text is that of Dr. Bright
   (Oxford, 1872), with an Introduction on the Life and Writings of
   Athanasius (rewritten for D.C.B., vol. i., pp. 179 sqq.).

   [1820] Not that he was willing to suppress the term and surrender the
   Nicene cause, far from it; but he sees the relative importance of
   things and words. This shews the absurdity of the taunt, that the
   Nicene theologians fought ferociously over a single iota.'

   Four Discourses Against the Arians.

   Discourse I.

   ------------------------

   Chapter I.--Introduction. Reason for writing; certain persons
   indifferent about Arianism; Arians not Christians, because sectaries
   always take the name of their founder.

   1. Of all other heresies which have departed from the truth it is
   acknowledged that they have but devised [1821] a madness, and their
   irreligiousness has long since become notorious to all men. For that
   [1822] their authors went out from us, it plainly follows, as the
   blessed John has written, that they never thought nor now think with
   us. Wherefore, as saith the Saviour, in that they gather not with us,
   they scatter with the devil, and keep an eye on those who slumber,
   that, by this second sowing of their own mortal poison, they may have
   companions in death. But, whereas one heresy, and that the last, which
   has now risen as harbinger [1823] of Antichrist, the Arian, as it is
   called, considering that other heresies, her elder sisters, have been
   openly proscribed, in her craft and cunning, affects to array herself
   in Scripture language [1824] , like her father the devil, and is
   forcing her way back into the Church's paradise,--that with the
   pretence of Christianity, her smooth sophistry (for reason she has
   none) may deceive men into wrong thoughts of Christ,--nay, since she
   has already seduced certain of the foolish, not only to corrupt their
   ears, but even to take and eat with Eve, till in their ignorance which
   ensues they think bitter sweet, and admire this loathsome heresy, on
   this account I have thought it necessary, at your request, to unrip the
   folds of its breast-plate [1825] ,' and to shew the ill savour of its
   folly. So while those who are far from it may continue to shun it,
   those whom it has deceived may repent; and, opening the eyes of their
   heart, may understand that darkness is not light, nor falsehood truth,
   nor Arianism good; nay, that those [1826] who call these men Christians
   are in great and grievous error, as neither having studied Scripture,
   nor understanding Christianity at all, and the faith which it contains.

   2. For what have they discovered in this heresy like to the religious
   Faith, that they vainly talk as if its supporters said no evil? This in
   truth is to call even Caiaphas [1827] a Christian, and to reckon the
   traitor Judas still among the Apostles, and to say that they who asked
   Barabbas instead of the Saviour did no evil, and to recommend HymenÃ¦us
   and Alexander as right-minded men, and as if the Apostle slandered
   them. But neither can a Christian bear to hear this, nor can he
   consider the man who dared to say it sane in his understanding. For
   with them for Christ is Arius, as with the Manichees ManichÃ¦us; and for
   Moses and the other saints they have made the discovery of one Sotades
   [1828] , a man whom even Gentiles laugh at, and of the daughter of
   Herodias. For of the one has Arius imitated the dissolute and
   effeminate tone, in writing ThaliÃ¦ on his model; and the other he has
   rivalled in her dance, reeling and frolicking in his blasphemies
   against the Saviour; till the victims of his heresy lose their wits and
   go foolish, and change the Name of the Lord of glory into the likeness
   of the image of corruptible man [1829] ,' and for Christians come to be
   called Arians, bearing this badge of their irreligion. For let them not
   excuse themselves; nor retort their disgrace on those who are not as
   they, calling Christians after the names of their teachers [1830] ,
   that they themselves may appear to have that Name in the same way. Nor
   let them make a jest of it, when they feel shame at their disgraceful
   appellation; rather, if they be ashamed, let them hide their faces, or
   let them recoil from their own irreligion. For never at any time did
   Christian people take their title from the Bishops among them, but from
   the Lord, on whom we rest our faith. Thus, though the blessed Apostles
   have become our teachers, and have ministered the Saviour's Gospel, yet
   not from them have we our title, but from Christ we are and are named
   Christians. But for those who derive the faith which they profess from
   others, good reason is it they should bear their name, whose property
   they have become [1831] .

   3. Yes surely; while all of us are and are called Christians after
   Christ, Marcion broached a heresy a long time since and was cast out;
   and those who continued with him who ejected him remained Christians;
   but those who followed Marcion were called Christians no more, but
   henceforth Marcionites. Thus Valentinus also, and Basilides, and
   ManichÃ¦us, and Simon Magus, have imparted their own name to their
   followers; and some are accosted as Valentinians, or as Basilidians, or
   as Manichees, or as Simonians; and other, Cataphrygians from Phrygia,
   and from Novatus Novatians. So too Meletius, when ejected by Peter the
   Bishop and Martyr, called his party no longer Christians, but Meletians
   [1832] , and so in consequence when Alexander of blessed memory had
   cast out Arius, those who remained with Alexander, remained Christians;
   but those who went out with Arius, left the Saviour's Name to us who
   were with Alexander, and as to them they were hence-forward denominated
   Arians. Behold then, after Alexander's death too, those who communicate
   with his successor Athanasius, and those with whom the said Athanasius
   communicates, are instances of the same rule; none of them bear his
   name, nor is he named from them, but all in like manner, and as is
   usual, are called Christians. For though we have a succession of
   teachers and become their disciples, yet, because we are taught by them
   the things of Christ, we both are, and are called, Christians all the
   same. But those who follow the heretics, though they have innumerable
   successors in their heresy, yet anyhow bear the name of him who devised
   it. Thus, though Arius be dead, and many of his party have succeeded
   him, yet those who think with him, as being known from Arius, are
   called Arians. And, what is a remarkable evidence of this, those of the
   Greeks who even at this time come into the Church, on giving up the
   superstition of idols, take the name, not of their catechists, but of
   the Saviour, and begin to be called Christians instead of Greeks: while
   those of them who go off to the heretics, and again all who from the
   Church change to this heresy, abandon Christ's name, and henceforth are
   called Arians, as no longer holding Christ's faith, but having
   inherited Arius's madness.

   4. How then can they be Christians, who for Christians are Ario-maniacs
   [1833] ? or how are they of the Catholic Church, who have shaken off
   the Apostolical faith, and become authors of fresh evils? who, after
   abandoning the oracles of divine Scripture, call Arius's ThaliÃ¦ a new
   wisdom? and with reason too, for they are announcing a new heresy. And
   hence a man may marvel, that, whereas many have written many treatises
   and abundant homilies upon the Old Testament and the New, yet in none
   of them is a Thalia found; nay nor among the more respectable of the
   Gentiles, but among those only who sing such strains over their cups,
   amid cheers and jokes, when men are merry, that the rest may laugh;
   till this marvellous Arius, taking no grave pattern, and ignorant even
   of what is respectable, while he stole largely from other heresies,
   would be original in the ludicrous, with none but Sotades for his
   rival. For what beseemed him more, when he would dance forth against
   the Saviour, than to throw his wretched words of irreligion into
   dissolute and loose metres? that, while a man,' as Wisdom says, is
   known from the utterance of his word [1834] ,' so from those numbers
   should be seen the writer's effeminate soul and corruption of thought
   [1835] . In truth, that crafty one did not escape detection; but, for
   all his many writhings to and fro, like the serpent, he did but fall
   into the error of the Pharisees. They, that they might transgress the
   Law, pretended to be anxious for the words of the Law, and that they
   might deny the expected and then present Lord, were hypocritical with
   God's name, and were convicted of blaspheming when they said, Why dost
   Thou, being a man, make Thyself God,' and sayest, I and the Father are
   one [1836] ?' And so too, this counterfeit and Sotadean Arius, feigns
   to speak of God, introducing Scripture language [1837] , but is on all
   sides recognised as godless [1838] Arius, denying the Son, and
   reckoning Him among the creatures.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1821] epinoesasai. This is almost a technical word, and has occurred
   again and again already, as descriptive of heretical teaching in
   opposition to the received traditionary doctrine. It is also found
   passim in other writers. Thus Socrates, speaking of the decree of the
   Council of Alexandria, 362, against Apollinaris; for not originating,
   epinoesantes, any novel devotion, did they introduce it into the
   Church, but what from the beginning the Ecclesiastical Tradition
   declared.' Hist. iii. 7. The sense of the word epinoia which will come
   into consideration below, is akin to this, being the view taken by the
   mind of an object independent of (whether or not correspondent to) the
   object itself. [But see Bigg. B. L. p. 168, sq.]

   professed a gift of prophecy introducing fresh revelations, as

   [1826] These Orations and Discourses seem written to shew the vital

   of the heresy, without reference to the word homoousion. He has
   [elsewhere] insisted that the enforcement of the symbol was but the
   rejection of the heresy, and accordingly he is here content to bring
   out the Catholic sense, as feeling that, if persons understood and
   embraced it, they would not scruple at the word. He seems to allude to

   [1830] He seems to allude to Catholics being called Athanasians; vid.
   however next Â§. Two distinctions are drawn between such a title as
   applied to Catholics, and again to heretics, when they are taken by
   Catholics as a note against them. S. Augustine says, Arians call
   Catholics Athanasians or HomoÃ¼sians, not other heretics too. But ye not
   only by Catholics but also by heretics, those who agree with you and
   those who disagree, are called Pelagians; as even by heresies are
   Arians called Arians. But ye, and ye only, call us Traducianists, as
   Arians call us HomoÃ¼sians, as Donatists Macarians, as Manichees
   Pharisees, and as the other heretics use various titles.' Op. imp. i.
   75. It may be added that the heretical name adheres, the Catholic dies
   away. S. Chrysostom draws a second distinction, Are we divided from the
   Church? have we heresiarchs? are we called from man? is there any
   leader to us, as to one there is Marcion, to another ManichÃ¦us, to
   another Arius, to another some other author of heresy? for if we too
   have the name of any, still it is not those who began the heresy, but
   our superiors and governors of the Church. We have not "teachers upon
   earth,"' &c. in Act. Ap. Hom. 33 fin.

   Name, and clothe themselves in human and foreign titles.' Lact. Inst.

   bear the name of Christian? for you are not called Christian but

   [1835] It is very difficult to gain a clear idea of the character of

   follows:--From elation of mind the old man swerved from the mark. He
   was in stature very tall, downcast in visage, with manners like wily
   serpent, captivating to every guileless heart by that same crafty
   bearing. For ever habited in cloke and vest, he was pleasant of
   address, ever persuading souls and flattering; wherefore what was his
   very first work but to withdraw from the Church in one body as many as
   seven hundred women who professed virginity.?' HÃ¦r. 69. 3, cf. ib. Â§9

   [1838] And so godless or atheist Aetius, de Syn. 6, note 3, cf. note on

   ad Serap. iii. 2, that if a man says that the Son is a creature, who is
   word and Wisdom, and the Expression, and the Radiance, whom whoso seeth
   seeth the Father,' he falls under the text, Whoso denieth the Son, the
   same hath not the Father.' Such a one,' he continues, will in no long
   time say, as the fool, There is no God.' In like manner he speaks of
   those who think the Son to be the Spirit as without (exo) the Holy
   Trinity, and atheists' (Serap. iv. 6), because they really do not
   believe in the God that is, and there is none other but He. Cf. also

   Anti-pope, on account of his cruelties, this second Arius, the more
   copious river of the atheistic spring, tes atheou peges.' Orat. 25. 11.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter II.--Extracts from the Thalia of Arius. Arius maintains that
   God became a Father, and the Son was not always; the Son out of
   nothing; once He was not; He was not before his generation; He was
   created; named Wisdom and Word after God's attributes; made that He
   might make us; one out of many powers of God; alterable; exalted on
   God's foreknowledge of what He was to be; not very God; but called so
   as others by participation; foreign in essence from the Father; does
   not know or see the Father; does not know Himself.

   5. Now the commencement of Arius's Thalia and flippancy, effeminate in
   tune and nature, runs thus:--

   According to faith of God's elect, God's prudent ones,

   Holy children, rightly dividing, God's Holy Spirit receiving,

   Have I learned this from the partakers of wisdom,

   Accomplished, divinely taught, and wise in all things.

   Along their track, have I been walking, with like opinions.

   I the very famous, the much suffering for God's glory;

   And taught of God, I have acquired wisdom and knowledge.'

   And the mockeries which he utters in it, repulsive and most
   irreligious, are such as these [1839] :--God was not always a Father;'
   but once God was alone, and not yet a Father, but afterwards He became
   a Father.' The Son was not always;' for, whereas all things were made
   out of nothing, and all existing creatures and works were made, so the
   Word of God Himself was made out of nothing,' and once He was not,' and
   He was not before His origination,' but He as others had an origin of
   creation.' For God,' he says, was alone, and the Word as yet was not,
   nor the Wisdom. Then, wishing to form us, thereupon He made a certain
   one, and named Him Word and Wisdom and Son, that He might form us by
   means of Him.' Accordingly, he says that there are two wisdoms, first,
   the attribute co-existent with God, and next, that in this wisdom the
   Son was originated, and was only named Wisdom and Word as partaking of
   it. For Wisdom,' saith he, by the will of the wise God, had its
   existence in Wisdom.' In like manner, he says, that there is another
   Word in God besides the Son, and that the Son again, as partaking of
   it, is named Word and Son according to grace. And this too is an idea
   proper to their heresy, as shewn in other works of theirs, that there
   are many powers; one of which is God's own by nature and eternal; but
   that Christ, on the other hand, is not the true power of God; but, as
   others, one of the so-called powers, one of which, namely, the locust
   and the caterpillar [1840] , is called in Scripture, not merely the
   power, but the great power.' The others are many and are like the Son,
   and of them David speaks in the Psalms, when he says, The Lord of
   hosts' or powers [1841] .' And by nature, as all others, so the Word
   Himself is alterable, and remains good by His own free will, while He
   chooseth; when, however, He wills, He can alter as we can, as being of
   an alterable nature. For therefore,' saith he, as foreknowing that He
   would be good, did God by anticipation bestow on Him this glory, which
   afterwards, as man, He attained from virtue. Thus in consequence of His
   works fore-known [1842] , did God bring it to pass that He being such,
   should come to be.'

   6. Moreover he has dared to say, that the Word is not the very God;'
   though He is called God, yet He is not very God,' but by participation
   of grace, He, as others, is God only in name.' And, whereas all beings
   are foreign and different from God in essence, so too is the Word alien
   and unlike in all things to the Father's essence and propriety,' but
   belongs to things originated and created, and is one of these.
   Afterwards, as though he had succeeded to the devil's recklessness, he
   has stated in his Thalia, that even to the Son the Father is
   invisible,' and the Word cannot perfectly and exactly either see or
   know His own Father;' but even what He knows and what He sees, He knows
   and sees in proportion to His own measure,' as we also know according
   to our own power. For the Son, too, he says, not only knows not the
   Father exactly, for He fails in comprehension [1843] , but He knows not
   even His own essence;'--and that the essences of the Father and the Son
   and the Holy Ghost, are separate in nature, and estranged, and
   disconnected, and alien [1844] , and without participation of each
   other [1845] ;' and, in his own words, utterly unlike from each other
   in essence and glory, unto infinity.' Thus as to likeness of glory and
   essence,' he says that the Word is entirely diverse from both the
   Father and the Holy Ghost. With such words hath the irreligious spoken;
   maintaining that the Son is distinct by Himself, and in no respect
   partaker of the Father. These are portions of Arius's fables as they
   occur in that jocose composition.

   7. Who is there that hears all this, nay, the tune of the Thalia, but
   must hate, and justly hate, this Arius jesting on such matters as on a
   stage [1846] ? who but must regard him, when he pretends to name God
   and speak of God, but as the serpent counselling the woman? who, on
   reading what follows in his work, but must discern in his irreligious
   doctrine that error, into which by his sophistries the serpent in the
   sequel seduced the woman? who at such blasphemies is not transported?
   The heaven,' as the Prophet says, was astonished, and the earth
   shuddered [1847] ' at the transgression of the Law. But the sun, with
   greater horror, impatient of the bodily contumelies, which the common
   Lord of all voluntarily endured for us, turned away, and recalling his
   rays made that day sunless. And shall not all human kind at Arius's
   blasphemies be struck speechless, and stop their ears, and shut their
   eyes, to escape hearing them or seeing their author? Rather, will not
   the Lord Himself have reason to denounce men so irreligious, nay, so
   unthankful, in the words which He has already uttered by the prophet
   Hosea, Woe unto them, for they have fled from Me; destruction upon
   them, for they have transgressed against Me; though I have redeemed
   them, yet they have spoken lies against Me [1848] .' And soon after,
   They imagine mischief against Me; they turn away to nothing [1849] .'
   For to turn away from the Word of God, which is, and to fashion to
   themselves one that is not, is to fall to what is nothing. For this was
   why the Ecumenical [1850] Council, when Arius thus spoke, cast him from
   the Church, and anathematized him, as impatient of such irreligion. And
   ever since has Arius's error been reckoned for a heresy more than
   ordinary, being known as Christ's foe, and harbinger [1851] of
   Antichrist. Though then so great a condemnation be itself of special
   weight to make men flee from that irreligious heresy [1852] , as I said
   above, yet since certain persons called Christian, either in ignorance
   or pretence, think it, as I then said, little different from the Truth,
   and call its professors Christians; proceed we to put some questions to
   them, according to our powers, thereby to expose the unscrupulousness
   of the heresy. Perhaps, when thus caught, they will be silenced, and
   flee from it, as from the sight of a serpent.

   [1843] Vid. de Syn. 15, note 6. katalepsis was originally a Stoic word,
   and even when considered perfect, was, properly speaking, attributable
   only to an imperfect being. For it is used in contrast to the Platonic
   doctrine of ideai, to express the hold of things obtained by the mind
   through the senses; it being a Stoical maxim, nihil esse in intellectu
   quod non fuerit in sensu. In this sense it is also used by the Fathers,
   to mean real and certain knowledge after inquiry, though it is also
   ascribed to Almighty God. As to the position of Arius, since we are
   told in Scripture that none knoweth the things of a man save the spirit
   of man which is in him,' if katalepsis be an exact and complete
   knowledge of the object of contemplation, to deny that the Son
   comprehended the Father, was to deny that He was in the Father, i.e.
   the doctrine of the perichoresis, de Syn. 15, anepimiktoi, or to
   maintain that He was a distinct, and therefore a created, being. On the
   other hand Scripture asserts that, as the Holy Spirit which is in God,
   searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God,' so the Son, as
   being in the bosom of the Father,' alone hath declared Him.' vid.
   Clement. Strom. v. 12. And thus Athan. speaking of Mark xiii. 32, 'If
   the Son is in the Father and the Father in the Son, and the Father
   knows the day and the hour, it is plain that the Son too, being in the
   Father, and knowing the things in the Father, Himself also knows the
   day and the hour." Orat. iii. 44.

   Chapter III.--The Importance of the Subject. The Arians affect
   Scripture language, but their doctrine new, as well as unscriptural.
   Statement of the Catholic doctrine, that the Son is proper to the
   Father's substance, and eternal. Restatement of Arianism in contrast,
   that He is a creature with a beginning: the controversy comes to this
   issue, whether one whom we are to believe in as God, can be so in name
   only, and is merely a creature. What pretence then for being
   indifferent in the controversy? The Arians rely on state patronage, and
   dare not avow their tenets.

   8. If then the use of certain phrases of divine Scripture changes, in
   their opinion, the blasphemy of the Thalia into reverent language, of
   course they ought also to deny Christ with the present Jews, when they
   see how they study the Law and the Prophets; perhaps too they will deny
   the Law [1853] and the Prophets like Manichees [1854] , because the
   latter read some portions of the Gospels. If such bewilderment and
   empty speaking be from ignorance, Scripture will teach them, that the
   devil, the author of heresies, because of the ill savour which attaches
   to evil, borrows Scripture language, as a cloak wherewith to sow the
   ground with his own poison also, and to seduce the simple. Thus he
   deceived Eve; thus he framed former heresies; thus he persuaded Arius
   at this time to make a show of speaking against those former ones, that
   he might introduce his own without observation. And yet, after all, the
   man of craft did not escape. For being irreligious towards the Word of
   God, he lost his all at once [1855] , and betrayed to all men his
   ignorance of other heresies too [1856] ; and having not a particle of
   truth in his belief, does but pretend to it. For how can he speak truth
   concerning the Father, who denies the Son, that reveals concerning Him?
   or how can he be orthodox concerning the Spirit, while he speaks
   profanely of the Word that supplies the Spirit? and who will trust him
   concerning the Resurrection, denying, as he does, Christ for us the
   first-begotten from the dead? and how shall he not err in respect to
   His incarnate presence, who is simply ignorant of the Son's genuine and
   true generation from the Father? For thus, the former Jews also,
   denying the Word, and saying, We have no king but CÃ¦sar [1857] ,' were
   forthwith stripped of all they had, and forfeited the light of the
   Lamp, the odour of ointment, knowledge of prophecy, and the Truth
   itself; till now they understand nothing, but are walking as in
   darkness. For who was ever yet a hearer of such a doctrine [1858] ? or
   whence or from whom did the abettors and hirelings [1859] of the heresy
   gain it? who thus expounded to them when they were at school [1860] ?
   who told them, Abandon the worship of the creation, and then draw near
   and worship a creature and a work [1861] ?' But if they themselves own
   that they have heard it now for the first time, how can they deny that
   this heresy is foreign, and not from our fathers [1862] ? But what is
   not from our fathers, but has come to light in this day, how can it be
   but that of which the blessed Paul [1863] has foretold, that in the
   latter times some shall depart from the sound faith, giving heed to
   seducing spirits and doctrines of devils, in the hypocrisy of liars;
   cauterized in their own conscience, and turning from the truth [1864]
   ?'

   9. For, behold, we take divine Scripture, and thence discourse with
   freedom of the religious Faith, and set it up as a light upon its
   candlestick, saying:--Very Son of the Father, natural and genuine,
   proper to His essence, Wisdom Only-begotten, and Very and Only Word of
   God is He; not a creature or work, but an offspring proper to the
   Father's essence. Wherefore He is very God, existing one [1865] in
   essence with the very Father; while other beings, to whom He said, I
   said ye are Gods [1866] ,' had this grace from the Father, only by
   participation [1867] of the Word, through the Spirit. For He is the
   expression of the Father's Person, and Light from Light, and Power, and
   very Image of the Father's essence. For this too the Lord has said, He
   that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father [1868] .' And He ever was and
   is and never was not. For the Father being everlasting, His Word and
   His Wisdom must be everlasting [1869] . On the other hand, what have
   these persons to shew us from the infamous Thalia? Or, first of all,
   let them read it themselves, and copy the tone of the writer; at least
   the mockery which they will encounter from others may instruct them how
   low they have fallen; and then let them proceed to explain themselves.
   For what can they say from it, but that God was not always a Father,
   but became so afterwards; the Son was not always, for He was not before
   His generation; He is not from the Father, but He, as others, has come
   into subsistence out of nothing; He is not proper to the Father's
   essence, for He is a creature and work?' And Christ is not very God,
   but He, as others, was made God by participation; the Son has not exact
   knowledge of the Father, nor does the Word see the Father perfectly;
   and neither exactly understands nor knows the Father. He is not the
   very and only Word of the Father, but is in name only called Word and
   Wisdom, and is called by grace Son and Power. He is not unalterable, as
   the Father is, but alterable in nature, as the creatures, and He comes
   short of apprehending the perfect knowledge of the Father.' Wonderful
   this heresy, not plausible even, but making speculations against Him
   that is, that He be not, and everywhere putting forward blasphemy for
   reverent language! Were any one, after inquiring into both sides, to be
   asked, whether of the two he would follow in faith, or whether of the
   two spoke fitly of God,--or rather let them say themselves, these
   abettors of irreligion, what, if a man be asked concerning God (for the
   Word was God'), it were fit to answer [1870] . For from this one
   question the whole case on both sides may be determined, what is
   fitting to say,--He was, or He was not; always, or before His birth;
   eternal, or from this and from then; true, or by adoption, and from
   participation and in idea [1871] ; to call Him one of things
   originated, or to unite Him to the Father; to consider Him unlike the
   Father in essence, or like and proper to Him; a creature, or Him
   through whom the creatures were originated; that He is the Father's
   Word, or that there is another word beside Him, and that by this other
   He was originated, and by another wisdom; and that He is only named
   Wisdom and Word, and is become a partaker of this wisdom, and second to
   it?

   10. Which of the two theologies sets forth our Lord Jesus Christ as God
   and Son of the Father, this which you vomited forth, or that which we
   have spoken and maintain from the Scriptures? If the Saviour be not
   God, nor Word, nor Son, you shall have leave to say what you will, and
   so shall the Gentiles, and the present Jews. But if He be Word of the
   Father and true Son, and God from God, and over all blessed for ever
   [1872] ,' is it not becoming to obliterate and blot out those other
   phrases and that Arian Thalia, as but a pattern of evil, a store of all
   irreligion, into which, whoso falls, knoweth not that giants perish
   with her, and reacheth the depths of Hades [1873] ?' This they know
   themselves, and in their craft they conceal it, not having the courage
   to speak out, but uttering something else [1874] . For if they speak, a
   condemnation will follow; and if they be suspected, proofs from
   Scripture will be cast [1875] at them from every side. Wherefore, in
   their craft, as children of this world, after feeding their so-called
   lamp from the wild olive, and fearing lest it should soon be quenched
   (for it is said, the light of the wicked shall be put out [1876] ,')
   they hide it under the bushel [1877] of their hypocrisy, and make a
   different profession, and boast of patronage of friends and authority
   of Constantius, that what with their hypocrisy and their professions,
   those who come to them may be kept from seeing how foul their heresy
   is. Is it not detestable even in this, that it dares not speak out, but
   is kept hid by its own friends, and fostered as serpents are? for from
   what sources have they got together these words? or from whom have they
   received what they venture to say [1878] ? Not any one man can they
   specify who has supplied it. For who is there in all mankind, Greek or
   Barbarian, who ventures to rank among creatures One whom he confesses
   the while to be God and says, that He was not till He was made? or who
   is there, who to the God in whom he has put faith, refuses to give
   credit, when He says, This is My beloved Son [1879] ,' on the pretence
   that He is not a Son, but a creature? rather, such madness would rouse
   an universal indignation. Nor does Scripture afford them any pretext;
   for it has been often shewn, and it shall be shewn now, that their
   doctrine is alien to the divine oracles. Therefore, since all that
   remains is to say that from the devil came their mania (for of such
   opinions he alone is sower [1880] ), proceed we to resist him--for with
   him is our real conflict, and they are but instruments;--that, the Lord
   aiding us, and the enemy, as he is wont, being overcome with arguments,
   they may be put to shame, when they see him without resource who sowed
   this heresy in them, and may learn, though late, that, as being Arians,
   they are not Christians.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter IV.--That the Son is Eternal and Increate. These attributes,
   being the points in dispute, are first proved by direct texts of
   Scripture. Concerning the eternal power' of God in Rom. i. 20, which is
   shewn to mean the Son. Remarks on the Arian formula, Once the Son was
   not,' its supporters not daring to speak of a time when the Son was
   not.'

   11. At his suggestion then ye have maintained and ye think, that there
   was once when the Son was not;' this is the first cloke of your views
   of doctrine which has to be stripped off. Say then what was once when
   the Son was not, O slanderous and irreligious men [1881] ? If ye say
   the Father, your blasphemy is but greater; for it is impious to say
   that He was once,' or to signify Him by the word once.' For He is ever,
   and is now, and as the Son is, so is He, and is Himself He that is, and
   Father of the Son. But if ye say that the Son was once, when He Himself
   was not, the answer is foolish and unmeaning. For how could He both be
   and not be? In this difficulty, you can but answer, that there was a
   time when the Word was not; for your very adverb once' naturally
   signifies this. And your other, The Son was not before His generation,'
   is equivalent to saying, There was once when He was not,' for both the
   one and the other signify that there is a time before the Word. Whence
   then this your discovery? Why do ye, as the heathen, rage, and imagine
   vain phrases against the Lord [1882] and against His Christ?' for no
   holy Scripture has used such language of the Saviour, but rather
   always' and eternal' and coexistent always with the Father.' For, In
   the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
   God [1883] .' And in the Apocalypse he thus speaks [1884] ; Who is and
   who was and who is to come.' Now who can rob who is' and who was' of
   eternity? This too in confutation of the Jews hath Paul written in his
   Epistle to the Romans, Of whom as concerning the flesh is Christ, who
   is over all, God blessed for ever [1885] ;' while silencing the Greeks,
   he has said, The visible things of Him from the creation of the world
   are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even
   His eternal Power and Godhead [1886] ;' and what the Power of God is,
   he teaches us elsewhere himself, Christ the Power of God and the Wisdom
   of God [1887] .' Surely in these words he does not designate the
   Father, as ye often whisper one to another, affirming that the Father
   is His eternal power.' This is not so; for he says not, God Himself is
   the power,' but His is the power.' Very plain is it to all that His' is
   not He;' yet not something alien but rather proper to Him. Study too
   the context and turn to the Lord;' now the Lord is that Spirit [1888]
   ;'and you will see that it is the Son who is signified.

   12. For after making mention of the creation, he naturally speaks of
   the Framer's Power as seen in it, which Power, I say, is the Word of
   God, by whom all things have been made. If indeed the creation is
   sufficient of itself alone, without the Son, to make God known, see
   that you fall not, from thinking that without the Son it has come to
   be. But if through the Son it has come to be, and in Him all things
   consist [1889] ,' it must follow that he who contemplates the creation
   rightly, is contemplating also the Word who framed it, and through Him
   begins to apprehend the Father [1890] . And if, as the Saviour also
   says, No one knoweth the Father, save the Son, and he to whom the Son
   shall reveal Him [1891] ,' and if on Philip's asking, Shew us the
   Father,' He said not, Behold the creation,' but, He that hath seen Me,
   hath seen the Father [1892] ,' reasonably doth Paul,--while accusing
   the Greeks of contemplating the harmony and order of the creation
   without reflecting on the Framing Word within it (for the creatures
   witness to their own Framer) so as through the creation to apprehend
   the true God, and abandon their worship of it,--reasonably hath he
   said, His Eternal Power and Godhead [1893] ,' thereby signifying the
   Son. And where the sacred writers say, Who exists before the ages,' and
   By whom He made the ages [1894] ,' they thereby as clearly preach the
   eternal and everlasting being of the Son, even while they are
   designating God Himself. Thus, if Isaiah says, The Everlasting God, the
   Creator of the ends of the earth [1895] ;' and Susanna said, O
   Everlasting God [1896] ;' and Baruch wrote, I will cry unto the
   Everlasting in my days,' and shortly after, My hope is in the
   Everlasting, that He will save you, and joy is come unto me from the
   Holy One [1897] ;' yet forasmuch as the Apostle, writing to the
   Hebrews, says, Who being the radiance of His glory and the Expression
   of His Person [1898] ;' and David too in the eighty-ninth Psalm, And
   the brightness of the Lord be upon us,' and, In Thy Light shall we see
   Light [1899] ,' who has so little sense as to doubt of the eternity of
   the Son [1900] ? for when did man see light without the brightness of
   its radiance, that he may say of the Son, There was once, when He was
   not,' or Before His generation He was not.' And the words addressed to
   the Son in the hundred and forty-fourth Psalm, Thy kingdom is a kingdom
   of all ages [1901] ,' forbid any one to imagine any interval at all in
   which the Word did not exist. For if every interval in the ages is
   measured, and of all the ages the Word is King and Maker, therefore,
   whereas no interval at all exists prior to Him [1902] , it were madness
   to say, There was once when the Everlasting was not,' and From nothing
   is the Son.' And whereas the Lord Himself says, I am the Truth [1903]
   ,' not I became the Truth;' but always, I am,--I am the Shepherd,--I am
   the Light,'--and again, Call ye Me not, Lord and Master? and ye call Me
   well, for so I am,' who, hearing such language from God, and the
   Wisdom, and Word of the Father, speaking of Himself, will any longer
   hesitate about the truth, and not forthwith believe that in the phrase
   I am,' is signified that the Son is eternal and without beginning?

   13. It is plain then from the above that the Scriptures declare the
   Son's eternity; it is equally plain from what follows that the Arian
   phrases He was not,' and before' and when,' are in the same Scriptures
   predicated of creatures. Moses, for instance, in his account of the
   generation of our system, says, And every plant of the field, before it
   was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew; for the
   Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a
   man to till the ground [1904] .' And in Deuteronomy, When the Most High
   divided to the nations [1905] .' And the Lord said in His own Person,
   If ye loved Me, ye would rejoice because I said, I go unto the Father,
   for My Father is greater than I. And now I have told you before it come
   to pass, that when it is come to pass, ye might believe [1906] .' And
   concerning the creation He says by Solomon, Or ever the earth was, when
   there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains
   abounding with water. Before the mountains were settled, before the
   hills, was I brought forth [1907] .' And, Before Abraham was, I am
   [1908] .' And concerning Jeremiah He says, Before I formed thee in the
   womb, I knew thee [1909] .' And David in the Psalm says, Before the
   mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the world were
   made, Thou art, God from everlasting and world without end [1910] .'
   And in Daniel, Susanna cried out with a loud voice and said, O
   everlasting God, that knowest the secrets, and knowest all things
   before they be [1911] .' Thus it appears that the phrases once was
   not,' and before it came to be,' and when,' and the like, belong to
   things originate and creatures, which come out of nothing, but are
   alien to the Word. But if such terms are used in Scripture of things
   originate, but ever' of the Word, it follows, O ye enemies of God, that
   the Son did not come out of nothing, nor is in the number of originated
   things at all, but is the Father's Image and Word eternal, never having
   not been, but being ever, as the eternal Radiance [1912] of a Light
   which is eternal. Why imagine then times before the Son? or wherefore
   blaspheme the Word as after times, by whom even the ages were made? for
   how did time or age at all subsist when the Word, as you say, had not
   appeared, through' whom all things have been made and without' whom not
   one thing was made [1913] ?' Or why, when you mean time, do you not
   plainly say, a time was when the Word was not?' But while you drop the
   word time' to deceive the simple, you do not at all conceal your own
   feeling, nor, even if you did, could you escape discovery. For you
   still simply mean times, when you say, There was when He was not,' and
   He was not before His generation.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1881] Athan. observes that this formula of the Arians is a mere
   evasion to escape using the word time.' vid. also Cyril. Thesaur. iv.
   pp. 19, 20. Else let them explain,--There was,' what when the Son was
   not?' or what was before the Son? since He Himself was before all times
   and ages, which He created, de Decr. 18, note 5. Thus, if when' be a
   word of time, He it is who was when' He was not, which is absurd. Did
   they mean, however, that it was the Father who was' before the Son?
   This was true, if before' was taken, not to imply time, but origination
   or beginning. And in this sense the first verse of S. John's Gospel may
   be interpreted In the Beginning,' or Origin, i.e. in the Father was the
   Word.' Thus Athan. himself understands that text, Orat. iv. Â§1. vid.
   also Orat. iii. Â§9; Nyssen. contr. Eunom. iii. p. 106; Cyril. Thesaur.

   [1887] 1 Cor. i. 24. Athan. has so interpreted this text supr. de Decr.

   NicÃ¦a, for Asterius had some years before these Discourses replied to
   it, vid. de Syn. 18, and Orat. ii. Â§37.

   [1888] 2 Cor. iii. 16, 17. S. Athanasius observes, Serap. i. 4-7, that
   the Holy Ghost is never in Scripture called simply Spirit' without the
   addition of God' or of the Father' or from Me' or of the article, or of
   Holy,' or Comforter,' or of truth,' or unless He has been spoken of
   just before. Accordingly this text is understood of the third Person in
   the Holy Trinity by Origen, contr. Cels. vi. 70; Basil de Sp. S. n. 32;
   Pseudo-Athan. de comm. ess. 6. On the other hand, the word pneuma,
   Spirit, is used more or less distinctly for our Lord's Divine Nature
   whether in itself or as incarnate, in Rom. i. 4, 1 Cor. xv. 45, 1 Tim.
   iii. 16, Hebr. ix. 14, 1 Pet. iii. 18, John vi. 63, &c. [But cf. also
   Milligan Resurr. 238 sq.] Indeed the early Fathers speak as if the Holy
   Spirit,' which came down upon S. Mary might be considered the Word.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter V.--Subject Continued. Objection, that the Son's eternity makes
   Him coordinate with the Father, introduces the subject of His Divine
   Sonship, as a second proof of His eternity. The word Son is introduced
   in a secondary, but is to be understood in real sense. Since all things
   partake of the Father in partaking of the Son, He is the whole
   participation of the Father, that is, He is the Son by nature; for to
   be wholly participated is to beget.

   14. When these points are thus proved, their profaneness goes further.
   If there never was, when the Son was not,' say they, but He is eternal,
   and coexists with the Father, you call Him no more the Father's Son,
   but brother [1914] .' O insensate and contentious! For if we said only
   that He was eternally with the Father, and not His Son, their pretended
   scruple would have some plausibility; but if, while we say that He is
   eternal, we also confess Him to be Son from the Father, how can He that
   is begotten be considered brother of Him who begets? And if our faith
   is in Father and Son, what brotherhood is there between them? and how
   can the Word be called brother of Him whose Word He is? This is not an
   objection of men really ignorant, for they comprehend how the truth
   lies; but it is a Jewish pretence, and that from those who, in
   Solomon's words, through desire separate themselves [1915] ' from the
   truth. For the Father and the Son were not generated from some
   pre-existing origin [1916] , that we may account Them brothers, but the
   Father is the Origin of the Son and begat Him; and the Father is
   Father, and not born the Son of any; and the Son is Son, and not
   brother. Further, if He is called the eternal offspring [1917] of the
   Father, He is rightly so called. For never was the essence of the
   Father imperfect, that what is proper to it should be added afterwards
   [1918] ; nor, as man from man, has the Son been begotten, so as to be
   later than His Father's existence, but He is God's offspring, and as
   being proper Son of God, who is ever, He exists eternally. For, whereas
   it is proper to men to beget in time, from the imperfection of their
   nature [1919] , God's offspring is eternal, for His nature is ever
   perfect [1920] . If then He is not a Son, but a work made out of
   nothing, they have but to prove it; and then they are at liberty, as if
   imagining about a creature, to cry out, There was once when He was
   not;' for things which are originated were not, and have come to be.
   But if He is Son, as the Father says, and the Scriptures proclaim, and
   Son' is nothing else than what is generated from the Father; and what
   is generated from the Father is His Word, and Wisdom, and Radiance;
   what is to be said but that, in maintaining Once the Son was not,' they
   rob God of His Word, like plunderers, and openly predicate of Him that
   He was once without His proper Word and Wisdom, and that the Light was
   once without radiance, and the Fountain was once barren and dry [1921]
   ? For though they pretend alarm at the name of time, because of those
   who reproach them with it, and say, that He was before times, yet
   whereas they assign certain intervals, in which they imagine He was
   not, they are most irreligious still, as equally suggesting times, and
   imputing to God an absence of Reason [1922] .

   15. But if on the other hand, while they acknowledge with us the name
   of Son,' from an unwillingness to be publicly and generally condemned,
   they deny that the Son is the proper offspring of the Father's essence,
   on the ground that this must imply parts and divisions [1923] ; what is
   this but to deny that He is very Son, and only in name to call Him Son
   at all? And is it not a grievous error, to have material thoughts about
   what is immaterial, and because of the weakness of their proper nature
   to deny what is natural and proper to the Father? It does but remain,
   that they should deny Him also, because they understand not how God is
   [1924] , and what the Father is, now that, foolish men, they measure by
   themselves the Offspring of the Father. And persons in such a state of
   mind as to consider that there cannot be a Son of God, demand our pity;
   but they must be interrogated and exposed for the chance of bringing
   them to their senses. If then, as you say, the Son is from nothing,'
   and was not before His generation,' He, of course, as well as others,
   must be called Son and God and Wisdom only by participation; for thus
   all other creatures consist, and by sanctification are glorified. You
   have to tell us then, of what He is partaker [1925] . All other things
   partake of the Spirit, but He, according to you, of what is He
   partaker? of the Spirit? Nay, rather the Spirit Himself takes from the
   Son, as He Himself says; and it is not reasonable to say that the
   latter is sanctified by the former. Therefore it is the Father that He
   partakes; for this only remains to say. But this, which is
   participated, what is it or whence [1926] ? If it be something external
   provided by the Father, He will not now be partaker of the Father, but
   of what is external to Him; and no longer will He be even second after
   the Father, since He has before Him this other; nor can He be called
   Son of the Father, but of that, as partaking which He has been called
   Son and God. And if this be unseemly and irreligious, when the Father
   says, This is My Beloved Son [1927] ,' and when the Son says that God
   is His own Father, it follows that what is partaken is not external,
   but from the essence of the Father. And as to this again, if it be
   other than the essence of the Son, an equal extravagance will meet us;
   there being in that case something between this that is from the Father
   and the essence of the Son, whatever that be [1928] .

   16. Such thoughts then being evidently unseemly and untrue, we are
   driven to say that what is from the essence of the Father, and proper
   to Him, is entirely the Son; for it is all one to say that God is
   wholly participated, and that He begets; and what does begetting
   signify but a Son? And thus of the Son Himself, all things partake
   according to the grace of the Spirit coming from Him [1929] ; and this
   shews that the Son Himself partakes of nothing, but what is partaken
   from the Father, is the Son; for, as partaking of the Son Himself, we
   are said to partake of God; and this is what Peter said that ye may be
   partakers in a divine nature [1930] ;' as says too the Apostle, Know ye
   not, that ye are a temple of God?' and, We are the temple of a living
   God [1931] .' And beholding the Son, we see the Father; for the thought
   [1932] and comprehension of the Son, is knowledge concerning the
   Father, because He is His proper offspring from His essence. And since
   to be partaken no one of us would ever call affection or division of
   God's essence (for it has been shewn and acknowledged that God is
   participated, and to be participated is the same thing as to beget);
   therefore that which is begotten is neither affection nor division of
   that blessed essence. Hence it is not incredible that God should have a
   Son, the Offspring of His own essence; nor do we imply affection or
   division of God's essence, when we speak of Son' and Offspring;' but
   rather, as acknowledging the genuine, and true, and Only-begotten of
   God, so we believe. If then, as we have stated and are shewing, what is
   the Offspring of the Father's essence be the Son, we cannot hesitate,
   rather we must be certain, that the same [1933] is the Wisdom and Word
   of the Father, in and through whom He creates and makes all things; and
   His Brightness too, in whom He enlightens all things, and is revealed
   to whom He will; and His Expression and Image also, in whom He is
   contemplated and known, wherefore He and His Father are one [1934] ,'
   and whoso looketh on Him looketh on the Father; and the Christ, in whom
   all things are redeemed, and the new creation wrought afresh. And on
   the other hand, the Son being such Offspring, it is not fitting, rather
   it is full of peril, to say, that He is a work out of nothing, or that
   He was not before His generation. For he who thus speaks of that which
   is proper to the Father's essence, already blasphemes the Father
   Himself [1935] ; since he really thinks of Him what he falsely imagines
   of His offspring.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1914] This was an objection urged by Eunomius, cf. de Syn. 51, note 8.
   It is implied also in the Apology of the former, Â§24, and in Basil.
   contr. Eunom. ii. 28. Aetius was in Alexandria with George of
   Cappadocia, a.d. 356-8, and Athan. wrote these Discourses in the latter
   year, as the de Syn. at the end of the next. It is probable then that
   he is alluding to the Anomoean arguments as he heard them reported,
   vid. de Syn. l.c. where he says, they say, "as you have written,"' Â§51.
   'Anomoios kat' ousian is mentioned infr. Â§17. As the Arians here object
   that the First and Second Persons of the Holy Trinity are adelphoi, so
   did they say the same in the course of the controversy of the Second
   and Third. vid. Serap. i. 15. iv. 2.

   [1915] Prov. xviii. 1.

   [1916] Vid. de Syn. Â§51.

   [1917] In other words, by the Divine gennesis is not meant an act but
   an eternal and unchangeable fact, in the Divine Essence. Arius. not
   admitting this, objected at the outset of the controversy to the phrase
   always Father, always Son,' Theod. H. E. i. 4. p. 749, and Eunomius
   argues that, if the Son is co-eternal with the Father, the Father was
   never such in act, energos, but was argos.' Cyril. Thesaur. v. p. 41.
   S. Cyril answers that works,' erga, are made exothen, from without;'
   but that our Lord, as S. Athanasius here says, is neither a work' nor
   from without.' And hence he says elsewhere that, while men are fathers
   first in posse then in act, God is dunamei te kai energei& 139; pater.
   Dial. 2. p. 458. (vid. supr. p. 65. note m). Victorinus in like manner,
   says, that God is potentia et actione Deus sed in Ã¦terna, Adv. Ar. i.
   p. 202; and he quotes S. Alexander, speaking apparently in answer to
   Arius, of a semper generans generatio. And Arius scoffs at aeigennes
   and agennetogenes. Theod. Hist. i. 4. p. 749. And Origen had said, ho
   soter aei gennatai. ap. Routh. Reliq. t. 4. p. 304 and S. Dionysius
   calls Him the Radiance, anarchon kai aeigenes. Sent. Dion 15. S.
   Augustine too says, Semper gignit Pater, et semper nascitur Filius. Ep.
   238. n. 4. Petav. de Trin. ii. 5. n. 7, quotes the following passage
   from Theodorus Abucara, Since the Son's generation does but signify His
   having His existence from the Father, which He has ever, therefore He
   is ever begotten. For it became Him, who is properly (kurios) the Son,
   ever to be deriving His existence from the Father, and not as we who
   derive its commencement only. In us generation is a way to existence;
   in the Son of God it denotes the existence itself; in Him it has not
   existence for its end, but it is itself an end, telos, and is perfect,
   teleion.' Opusc 26.

   [1919] Infr. Â§26 fin., and de Decr. 12, note 2.

   [1920] Vid. supr. note 4. A similar passage is found in Cyril. Thesaur.
   v. p. 42, Dial. ii. fin. This was retorting the objection; the Arians
   said, How can God be ever perfect, who added to Himself a Son?' Athan.
   answers, How can the Son not be eternal, since God is ever perfect?'
   vid. Greg. Nyssen, contr. Eunom. Append. p. 142. Cyril. Thesaur. x. p.
   78. As to the Son's perfection, Aetius objects ap. Epiph. HÃ¦r. 76. pp.
   925, 6, that growth and consequent accession from without were
   essentially involved in the idea of Sonship; whereas S. Greg. Naz.
   speaks of the Son as not atele proteron, eita teleion, hosper nomos tes
   hemeteras geneseos, Orat. 20. 9 fin. In like manner, S. Basil argues
   against Eunomius, that the Son is teleios, because He is the Image, not
   as if copied, which is a gradual work, but as a charakter, or
   impression of a seal, or as the knowledge communicated from master to
   scholar, which comes to the latter and exists in him perfect, without
   being lost to the former. contr. Eunom. ii. 16 fin.

   [1927] Matt. iii. 17.

   [1928] Here is taught us the strict unity of the Divine Essence. When
   it is said that the First Person of the Holy Trinity communicates
   divinity to the Second, it is meant that that one Essence which is the
   Father, also is the Son. Hence the force of the word homoousion, which
   was in consequence accused of Sabellianism, but was distinguished from
   it by the particle homou, together,' which implied a difference as well
   as unity; whereas tautoousion or sunousion implied, with the
   Sabellians, an identity or a confusion. The Arians, on the other hand,
   as in the instance of Eusebius, &c., supr. p. 75, note 7; de Syn. 26,
   note 3; considered the Father and the Son two ousiai. The Catholic
   doctrine is that, though the Divine Essence is both the Father
   Ingenerate and also the Only-begotten Son, it is not itself agennetos
   or gennete; which was the objection urged against the Catholics by
   Aetius, Epiph. HÃ¦r. 76. 10. Cf. de Decr. Â§30, Orat. iii. Â§36 fin.,

     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter VI.--Subject Continued. Third proof of the Son's eternity, viz.
   from other titles indicative of His coessentiality; as the Creator; One
   of the Blessed Trinity; as Wisdom; as Word; as Image. If the Son is a
   perfect Image of the Father, why is He not a Father also? because God,
   being perfect, is not the origin of a race. Only the Father a Father
   because the Only Father, only the Son a Son because the Only Son. Men
   are not really fathers and really sons, but shadows of the True. The
   Son does not become a Father, because He has received from the Father
   to be immutable and ever the same.

   17. This is of itself a sufficient refutation of the Arian heresy;
   however, its heterodoxy will appear also from the following:--If God be
   Maker and Creator, and create His works through the Son, and we cannot
   regard things which come to be, except as being through the Word, is it
   not blasphemous, God being Maker, to say, that His Framing Word and His
   Wisdom once was not? it is the same as saying, that God is not Maker,
   if He had not His proper Framing Word which is from Him, but that that
   by which He frames, accrues to Him from without [1936] , and is alien
   from Him, and unlike in essence. Next, let them tell us this,--or
   rather learn from it how irreligious they are in saying, Once He was
   not,' and, He was not before His generation;'--for if the Word is not
   with the Father from everlasting, the Triad is not everlasting; but a
   Monad was first, and afterwards by addition it became a Triad; and so
   as time went on, it seems what we know concerning God grew and took
   shape [1937] . And further, if the Son is not proper offspring of the
   Father's essence, but of nothing has come to be, then of nothing the
   Triad consists, and once there was not a Triad, but a Monad; and a
   Triad once with deficiency, and then complete; deficient, before the
   Son was originated, complete when He had come to be; and henceforth a
   thing originated is reckoned with the Creator, and what once was not
   has divine worship and glory with Him who was ever [1938] . Nay, what
   is more serious still, the Triad is discovered to be unlike Itself,
   consisting of strange and alien natures and essences. And this, in
   other words, is saying, that the Triad has an originated consistence.
   What sort of a religion then is this, which is not even like itself,
   but is in process of completion as time goes on, and is now not thus,
   and then again thus? For probably it will receive some fresh accession,
   and so on without limit, since at first and at starting it took its
   consistence by way of accessions. And so undoubtedly it may decrease on
   the contrary, for what is added plainly admits of being subtracted.

   18. But this is not so: perish the thought; the Triad is not
   originated; but there is an eternal and one Godhead in a Triad, and
   there is one Glory of the Holy Triad. And you presume to divide it into
   different natures; the Father being eternal, yet you say of the Word
   which is seated by Him, Once He was not;' and, whereas the Son is
   seated by the Father, yet you think to place Him far from Him. The
   Triad is Creator and Framer, and you fear not to degrade It to things
   which are from nothing; you scruple not to equal servile beings to the
   nobility of the Triad, and to rank the King, the Lord of Sabaoth with
   subjects [1939] . Cease this confusion of things unassociable, or
   rather of things which are not with Him who is. Such statements do not
   glorify and honour the Lord, but the reverse; for he who dishonours the
   Son, dishonours also the Father. For if the doctrine of God is now
   perfect in a Triad, and this is the true and only Religion, and this is
   the good and the truth, it must have been always so, unless the good
   and the truth be something that came after, and the doctrine of God is
   completed by additions. I say, it must have been eternally so; but if
   not eternally, not so at present either, but at present so, as you
   suppose it was from the beginning,--I mean, not a Triad now. But such
   heretics no Christian would bear; it belongs to Greeks, to introduce an
   originated Triad, and to level It with things originate; for these do
   admit of deficiencies and additions; but the faith of Christians
   acknowledges the blessed Triad as unalterable and perfect and ever what
   It was, neither adding to It what is more, nor imputing to It any loss
   (for both ideas are irreligious), and therefore it dissociates It from
   all things generated, and it guards as indivisible and worships the
   unity of the Godhead Itself; and shuns the Arian blasphemies, and
   confesses and acknowledges that the Son was ever; for He is eternal, as
   is the Father, of whom He is the Eternal Word,--to which subject let us
   now return again.

   19. If God be, and be called, the Fountain of wisdom and life--as He
   says by Jeremiah, They have forsaken Me the Fountain of living waters
   [1940] ;' and again, A glorious high throne from the beginning, is the
   place of our sanctuary; O Lord, the Hope of Israel, all that forsake
   Thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from Me shall be written in
   the earth, because they have forsaken the Lord, the Fountain of living
   waters [1941] ;' and in the book of Baruch it is written, Thou hast
   forsaken the Fountain of wisdom [1942] ,'--this implies that life and
   wisdom are not foreign to the Essence of the Fountain, but are proper
   to It, nor were at any time without existence, but were always. Now the
   Son is all this, who says, I am the Life [1943] ,' and, I Wisdom dwell
   with prudence [1944] .' Is it not then irreligious to say, Once the Son
   was not?' for it is all one with saying, Once the Fountain was dry,
   destitute of Life and Wisdom.' But a fountain it would then cease to
   be; for what begetteth not from itself, is not a fountain [1945] . What
   a load of extravagance! for God promises that those who do His will
   shall be as a fountain which the water fails not, saying by Isaiah the
   prophet, And the Lord shall satisfy thy soul in drought, and make thy
   bones fat; and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring
   of water, whose waters fail not [1946] .' And yet these, whereas God is
   called and is a Fountain of wisdom, dare to insult Him as barren and
   void of His proper Wisdom. But their doctrine is false; truth
   witnessing that God is the eternal Fountain of His proper Wisdom; and,
   if the Fountain be eternal, the Wisdom also must needs be eternal. For
   in It were all things made, as David says in the Psalm, In Wisdom hast
   Thou made them all [1947] ;' and Solomon says, The Lord by Wisdom hath
   formed the earth, by understanding hath He established the heavens
   [1948] .' And this Wisdom is the Word, and by Him, as John says, all
   things were made,' and without Him was made not one thing [1949] .' And
   this Word is Christ; for there is One God, the Father, from whom are
   all things, and we for Him; and One Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are
   all things, and we through Him [1950] .' And if all things are through
   Him, He Himself is not to be reckoned with that all.' For he who dares
   [1951] to call Him, through whom are things, one of that all,' surely
   will have like speculations concerning God, from whom are all. But if
   he shrinks from this as unseemly, and excludes God from that all, it is
   but consistent that he should also exclude from that all the
   Only-Begotten Son, as being proper to the Father's essence. And, if He
   be not one of the all [1952] , it is sin to say concerning Him, He was
   not,' and He was not before His generation.' Such words may be used of
   the creatures; but as to the Son, He is such as the Father is, of whose
   essence He is proper Offspring, Word, and Wisdom [1953] . For this is
   proper to the Son, as regards the Father, and this shews that the
   Father is proper to the Son; that we may neither say that God was ever
   without Word [1954] , nor that the Son was non-existent. For wherefore
   a Son, if not from Him? or wherefore Word and Wisdom, if not ever
   proper to Him?

   20. When then was God without that which is proper to Him? or how can a
   man consider that which is proper, as foreign and alien in essence? for
   other things, according to the nature of things originate, are without
   likeness in essence with the Maker; but are external to Him, made by
   the Word at His grace and will, and thus admit of ceasing to be, if it
   so pleases Him who made them [1955] ; for such is the nature of things
   originate [1956] . But as to what is proper to the Father's essence
   (for this we have already found to be the Son), what daring is it in
   irreligion to say that This comes from nothing,' and that It was not
   before generation,' but was adventitious [1957] , and can at some time
   cease to be again? Let a person only dwell upon this thought, and he
   will discern how the perfection and the plenitude of the Father's
   essence is impaired by this heresy; however, he will see its
   unseemliness still more clearly, if he considers that the Son is the
   Image and Radiance of the Father, and Expression, and Truth. For if,
   when Light exists, there be withal its Image, viz. Radiance, and, a
   Subsistence existing, there be of it the entire Expression, and, a
   Father existing, there be His Truth (viz. the Son); let them consider
   what depths of irreligion they fall into, who make time the measure of
   the Image and Form of the Godhead. For if the Son was not before His
   generation, Truth was not always in God, which it were a sin to say;
   for, since the Father was, there was ever in Him the Truth, which is
   the Son, who says, I am the Truth [1958] .' And the Subsistence
   existing, of course there was forthwith its Expression and Image; for
   God's Image is not delineated from without [1959] , but God Himself
   hath begotten it; in which seeing Himself, He has delight, as the Son
   Himself says, I was His delight [1960] .' When then did the Father not
   see Himself in His own Image? or when had He not delight, that a man
   should dare to say, the Image is out of nothing,' and The Father had
   not delight before the Image was originated?' and how should the Maker
   and Creator see Himself in a created and originated essence? for such
   as is the Father, such must be the Image.

   21. Proceed we then to consider the attributes of the Father, and we
   shall come to know whether this Image is really His. The Father is
   eternal, immortal, powerful, light, King, Sovereign, God, Lord,
   Creator, and Maker. These attributes must be in the Image, to make it
   true that he that hath seen' the Son hath seen the Father [1961] .' If
   the Son be not all this, but, as the Arians consider, originate, and
   not eternal, this is not a true Image of the Father, unless indeed they
   give up shame, and go on to say, that the title of Image, given to the
   Son, is not a token of a similar essence [1962] , but His name [1963]
   only. But this, on the other hand, O ye enemies of Christ, is not an
   Image, nor is it an Expression. For what is the likeness of what is out
   of nothing to Him who brought what was nothing into being? or how can
   that which is not, be like Him that is, being short of Him in once not
   being, and in its having its place among things originate? However,
   such the Arians wishing Him to be, devised for themselves arguments
   such as this;--If the Son is the Father's offspring and Image, and is
   like in all things [1964] to the Father, then it necessarily holds that
   as He is begotten, so He begets, and He too becomes father of a son.
   And again, he who is begotten from Him, begets in his turn, and so on
   without limit; for this is to make the Begotten like Him that begat
   Him.' Authors of blasphemy, verily, are these foes of God! who, sooner
   than confess that the Son is the Father's Image [1965] , conceive
   material and earthly ideas concerning the Father Himself, ascribing to
   Him severings and [1966] effluences and influences. If then God be as
   man, let Him become also a parent as man, so that His Son should be
   father of another, and so in succession one from another, till the
   series they imagine grows into a multitude of gods. But if God be not
   as man, as He is not, we must not impute to Him the attributes of man.
   For brutes and men, after a Creator has begun them, are begotten by
   succession; and the son, having been begotten of a father who was a
   son, becomes accordingly in his turn a father to a son, in inheriting
   from his father that by which he himself has come to be. Hence in such
   instances there is not, properly speaking, either father or son, nor do
   the father and the son stay in their respective characters, for the son
   himself becomes a father, being son of his father, but father of his
   son. But it is not so in the Godhead; for not as man is God; for the
   Father is not from a father; therefore doth He not beget one who shall
   become a father; nor is the Son from effluence of the Father, nor is He
   begotten from a father that was begotten; therefore neither is He
   begotten so as to beget. Thus it belongs to the Godhead alone, that the
   Father is properly [1967] father, and the Son properly son, and in
   Them, and Them only, does it hold that the Father is ever Father and
   the Son ever Son.

   22. Therefore he who asks why the Son is not to beget a son, must
   inquire why the Father had not a father. But both suppositions are
   unseemly and full of impiety. For as the Father is ever Father and
   never could become Son, so the Son is ever Son and never could become
   Father. For in this rather is He shewn to be the Father's Expression
   and Image, remaining what He is and not changing, but thus receiving
   from the Father to be one and the same. If then the Father change, let
   the Image change; for so is the Image and Radiance in its relation
   towards Him who begat It. But if the Father is unalterable, and what He
   is that He continues, necessarily does the Image also continue what He
   is, and will not alter. Now He is Son from the Father; therefore He
   will not become other than is proper to the Father's essence. Idly then
   have the foolish ones devised this objection also, wishing to separate
   the Image from the Father, that they might level the Son with things
   originated.

   must not be supposed from these instances that the Fathers meant that
   our Lord was literally what is called the attribute of reason or wisdom
   in the Divine Essence, or in other words, that He was God merely viewed
   as He is wise; which would be a kind of Sabellianism. But, whereas
   their opponents said that He was but called Word and Wisdom after the
   attribute (vid. de Syn. 15, note), they said that such titles marked,
   not only a typical resemblance to the attribute, but so full a
   correspondence and (as it were) coincidence in nature with it, that
   whatever relation that attribute had to God, such in kind had the
   Son;--that the attribute was His symbol, and not His mere archetype;
   that our Lord was eternal and proper to God, because that attribute
   was, which was His title, vid. Ep. Ã†g. 14, that our Lord was that
   Essential Reason and Wisdom,--not by which the Father is wise, but
   without which the Father was not wise;--not, that is, in the way of a
   formal cause, but in fact. Or, whereas the Father Himself is Reason and
   Wisdom, the Son is the necessary result of that Reason and Wisdom, so
   that, to say that there was no Word, would imply there was no Divine
   Reason; just as a radiance implies a light; or, as Petavius remarks,
   l.c. quoting the words which follow shortly after in the text, the
   eternity of the Original implies the eternity of the Image; tes

   [1955] This was but the opposite aspect of the tenet of our Lord's
   consubstantiality or eternal generation. For if He came into being at
   the will of God, by the same will He might cease to be; but if His
   existence is unconditional and necessary, as God's attributes might be,
   then as He had no beginning, so can He have no end; for He is in, and
   one with, the Father, who has neither beginning nor end. On the

   the name of Image to our Lord's consubstantiality rather than eternity,
   as, e.g. S. Gregory Naz. He is Image as one in essence,
   homoousion,...for this is the nature of an image, to be a copy of the
   archetype.' Orat. 30. 20. vid. also de Decr. Â§Â§20, 23, but for whatever
   reason Athan. avoids the word homoousion in these Discourses. S. Chrys.

   Considering what he says in the de Syn. Â§38, &c., in controversy with
   the semi-Arians a year or two later, this use of their formula, in
   preference to the homoousion (vid. foregoing note), deserves our
   attention.

   [1963] De Decr. Â§16.

   [1964] De Syn. 27 (5) note 1, and infr. Â§40.

   [1965] The objection is this, that, if our Lord be the Father's Image,
   He ought to resemble Him in being a Father. S. Athanasius answers that
   God is not as man; with us a son becomes a father because our nature is
   rheuste, transitive and without stay, ever shifting and passing on into
   new forms and relations; but that God is perfect and ever the same,
   what He is once that He continues to be; God the Father remains Father,
   and God the Son remains Son. Moreover men become fathers by detachment
   and transmission, and what is received is handed on in a succession;
   whereas the Father, by imparting Himself wholly, begets the Son: and a
   perfect nativity finds its termination in itself. The Son has not a
   Son, because the Father has not a Father. Thus the Father is the only
   true Father, and the Son alone true Son; the Father only a Father, the
   Son only a Son; being really in their Persons what human fathers are
   but by office, character, accident, and name; vid. De Decr. 11, note 6.
   And since the Father is unchangeable as Father, in nothing does the Son
   more fulfil the idea of a perfect Image than in being unchangeable too.
   Thus S. Cyril also, Thesaur. 10. p. 124. And this perhaps may
   illustrate a strong and almost startling implication of some of the
   Greek Fathers, that the First Person in the Holy Trinity, is not God
   [in virtue of His Fatherhood]. E.g. ei de theos ho hui& 232;s, ouk epei
   hui& 231;s; homoios kai ho pater, ouk epei pater, theos; all' epei
   ousia toiade, heis esti pater kai ho hui& 232;s theos. Nyssen. t. i. p.
   915. vid. Petav. de Deo i. 9. Â§13. Should it be asked, What is the
   Father if not God?' it is enough to answer, the Father.' Men differ
   from each other as being individuals, but the characteristic difference
   between Father and Son is, not that they are individuals, but that they
   are Father and Son. In these extreme statements it must be ever borne
   in mind that we are contemplating divine things according to our
   notions. not in fact: i.e. speaking of the Almighty Father, as such;
   there being no real separation between His Person and His Substance. It
   may be added, that, though theologians differ in their decisions, it
   would appear that our Lord is not the Image of the Father's person, but
   of the Father's substance; in other words, not of the Father considered
   as Father, but considered as God. That is, God the Son is like and
   equal to God the Father, because they are both the same God. De Syn.

   Chapter VII.--Objections to the Foregoing Proof. Whether, in the
   generation of the Son, God made One that was already, or One that was
   not.

   22 (continued). Ranking Him among these, according to the teaching of
   Eusebius, and accounting Him such as the things which come into being
   through Him, Arius and his fellows revolted from the truth, and used,
   when they commenced this heresy, to go about with dishonest phrases
   which they had got together; nay, up to this time some of them [1968] ,
   when they fall in with boys in the market-place, question them, not out
   of divine Scripture, but thus, as if bursting with the abundance of
   their heart [1969] ;'--He who is, did He make him who was not, from
   that which was [not], or him who was? therefore did He make the Son,
   whereas He was, or whereas He was not [1970] ?' And again, Is the
   Unoriginate one or two?' and Has He free will, and yet does not alter
   at His own choice, as being of an alterable nature? for He is not as a
   stone to remain by Himself unmoveable.' Next they turn to silly women,
   and address them in turn in this womanish language; Hadst thou a son
   before bearing? now, as thou hadst not, so neither was the Son of God
   before His generation.' In such language do the disgraceful men sport
   and revel, and liken God to men, pretending to be Christians, but
   changing God's glory into an image made like to corruptible man [1971]
   .'

   23. Words so senseless and dull deserved no answer at all; however,
   lest their heresy appear to have any foundation, it may be right,
   though we go out of the way for it, to refute them even here,
   especially on account of the silly women who are so readily deceived by
   them. When they thus speak, they should have inquired of an architect,
   whether he can build without materials; and if he cannot, whether it
   follows that God could not make the universe without materials [1972] .
   Or they should have asked every man, whether he can be without place;
   and if he cannot, whether it follows that God is in place, that so they
   may be brought to shame even by their audience. Or why is it that, on
   hearing that God has a Son, they deny Him by the parallel of
   themselves; whereas, if they hear that He creates and makes, no longer
   do they object their human ideas? they ought in creation also to
   entertain the same, and to supply God with materials, and so deny Him
   to be Creator, till they end in grovelling with Manichees. But if the
   bare idea of God transcends such thoughts, and, on very first hearing,
   a man believes and knows that He is in being, not as we are, and yet in
   being as God, and creates not as man creates, but yet creates as God,
   it is plain that He begets also not as men beget, but begets as God.
   For God does not make man His pattern; but rather we men, for that God
   is properly, and alone truly [1973] , Father of His Son, are also
   called fathers of our own children; for of Him is every fatherhood in
   heaven and earth named [1974] .' And their positions, while
   unscrutinized, have a shew of sense; but if any one scrutinize them by
   reason, they will be found to incur much derision and mockery.

   24. For first of all, as to their first question, which is such as
   this, how dull and vague it is! they do not explain who it is they ask
   about, so as to allow of an answer, but they say abstractedly, He who
   is,' him who is not.' Who then is,' and what are not,' O Arians? or who
   is,' and who is not?' what are said to be,' what not to be?' for He
   that is, can make things which are not, and which are, and which were
   before. For instance, carpenter, and goldsmith, and potter, each,
   according to his own art, works upon materials previously existing,
   making what vessels he pleases; and the God of all Himself, having
   taken the dust of the earth existing and already brought to be,
   fashions man; that very earth, however, whereas it was not once, He has
   at one time made by His own Word. If then this is the meaning of their
   question, the creature on the one hand plainly was not before its
   origination, and men, on the other, work the existing material; and
   thus their reasoning is inconsequent, since both what is' becomes, and
   what is not' becomes, as these instances shew. But if they speak
   concerning God and His Word, let them complete their question and then
   ask, Was the God, who is,' ever without Reason? and, whereas He is
   Light, was He ray-less? or was He always Father of the Word? Or again
   in this manner. Has the Father who is' made the Word who is not,' or
   has He ever with Him His Word, as the proper offspring of His
   substance? This will shew them that they do but presume and venture on
   sophisms about God and Him who is from Him. Who indeed can bear to hear
   them say that God was ever without Reason? this is what they fall into
   a second time, though endeavouring in vain to escape it and to hide it
   with their sophisms. Nay, one would fain not hear them disputing at
   all, that God was not always Father, but became so afterwards (which is
   necessary for their fantasy, that His Word once was not), considering
   the number of the proofs already adduced against them; while John
   besides says, The Word was [1975] ,' and Paul again writes, Who being
   the brightness of His glory [1976] ,' and, Who is over all, God blessed
   for ever. Amen [1977] .'

   25. They had best have been silent; but since it is otherwise, it
   remains to meet their shameless question with a bold retort [1978] .
   Perhaps on seeing the counter absurdities which beset themselves, they
   may cease to fight against the truth. After many prayers [1979] then
   that God would be gracious to us, thus we might ask them in turn; God
   who is, has He so become, whereas He was not? or is He also before His
   coming into being? whereas He is, did He make Himself, or is He of
   nothing, and being nothing before, did He suddenly appear Himself?
   Unseemly is such an enquiry, both unseemly and very blasphemous, yet
   parallel with theirs; for the answer they make abounds in irreligion.
   But if it be blasphemous and utterly irreligious thus to inquire about
   God, it will be blasphemous too to make the like inquiries about His
   Word. However, by way of exposing a question so senseless and so dull,
   it is necessary to answer thus:--whereas God is, He was eternally;
   since then the Father is ever, His Radiance ever is, which is His Word.
   And again, God who is, hath from Himself His Word who also is; and
   neither hath the Word been added, whereas He was not before, nor was
   the Father once without Reason. For this assault upon the Son makes the
   blasphemy recoil upon the Father; as if He devised for Himself a
   Wisdom, and Word, and Son from without [1980] ; for whichever of these
   titles you use, you denote the offspring from the Father, as has been
   said. So that this their objection does not hold; and naturally; for
   denying the Logos they in consequence ask questions which are
   illogical. As then if a person saw the sun, and then inquired
   concerning its radiance, and said, Did that which is make that which
   was, or that which was not,' he would be held not to reason sensibly,
   but to be utterly mazed, because he fancied what is from the Light to
   be external to it, and was raising questions, when and where and
   whether it were made; in like manner, thus to speculate concerning the
   Son and the Father and thus to inquire, is far greater madness, for it
   is to conceive of the Word of the Father as external to Him, and to
   idly call the natural offspring a work, with the avowal, He was not
   before His generation.' Nay, let them over and above take this answer
   to their question;--The Father who was, made the Son who was, for the
   Word was made flesh [1981] ;' and, whereas He was Son of God, He made
   Him in consummation of the ages also Son of Man, unless forsooth, after
   the Samosatene, they affirm that He did not even exist at all, till He
   became man.

   26. This is sufficient from us in answer to their first question. And
   now on your part, O Arians, remembering your own words, tell us whether
   He who was needed one who was not for the framing of the universe, or
   one who was? You said that He made for Himself His Son out of nothing,
   as an instrument whereby to make the universe. Which then is superior,
   that which needs or that which supplies the need? or does not each
   supply the deficiency of the other? You rather prove the weakness of
   the Maker, if He had not power of Himself to make the universe, but
   provided for Himself an instrument from without [1982] , as carpenter
   might do or shipwright, unable to work anything without adze and saw!
   Can anything be more irreligious? yet why should one dwell on its
   heinousness, when enough has gone before to shew that their doctrine is
   a mere fantasy?
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1968] This miserable procedure, of making sacred and mysterious
   subjects a matter of popular talk and debate, which is a sure mark of
   heresy, had received a great stimulus about this time by the rise of
   the Anomoeans. Eusebius's testimony to the profaneness which attended
   Arianism upon its rise will be given de Syn. 2, note 1. The Thalia is
   another instance of it. S. Alexander speaks of the interference, even
   judicial, in its behalf against himself, of disobedient women, di'
   entuchias gunaikarion atakton ha epatesan, and of the busy and indecent
   gadding about of the younger, ek tou peritrochazein pasan aguian
   asemnos. ap. Theod. H. E. i. 3. p. 730, also p. 747; also of the men's
   buffoon conversation, p. 731. Socrates says that in the Imperial Court,
   the officers of the bedchamber held disputes with the women, and in the
   city in every house there was a war of dialectics.' Hist. ii. 2. This
   mania raged especially in Constantinople, and S. Gregory Naz. speaks of
   Jezebels in as thick a crop as hemlock in a field.' Orat. 35. 3, cf. de
   Syn. 13, n. 4. He speaks of the heretics as aiming at one thing only,
   how to make good or refute points of argument,' making every
   market-place resound with their words, and spoiling every entertainment
   with their trifling and offensive talk.' Orat. 27. 2. The most
   remarkable testimony of the kind though not concerning Constantinople,
   is given by S. Gregory Nyssen, and often quoted, Men of yesterday and
   the day before, mere mechanics, off-hand dogmatists in theology,
   servants too and slaves that have been flogged, runaways from servile
   work, are solemn with us and philosophical about things
   incomprehensible....With such the whole city is full; its smaller
   gates, forums, squares, thoroughfares; the clothes-venders, the
   money-lenders, the victuallers. Ask about pence, and he will discuss
   the Generate and Ingenerate; inquire the price of bread, he answers,
   Greater is the Father, and the Son is subject; say that a bath would
   suit you, and he defines that the Son is out of nothing.' t. 2. p. 898.

   Chapter VIII.--Objections Continued. Whether we may decide the question
   by the parallel of human sons, which are born later than their parents.
   No, for the force of the analogy lies in the idea of connaturality.
   Time is not involved in the idea of Son, but is adventitious to it, and
   does not attach to God, because He is without parts and passions. The
   titles Word and Wisdom guard our thoughts of Him and His Son from this
   misconception. God not a Father, as a Creator, in posse from eternity,
   because creation does not relate to the essence of God, as generation
   does.

   26. (continued). Nor is answer needful to their other very simple and
   foolish inquiry, which they put to silly women; or none besides that
   which has been already given, namely, that it is not suitable to
   measure divine generation by the nature of men. However, that as before
   they may pass judgment on themselves, it is well to meet them on the
   same ground, thus:--Plainly, if they inquire of parents concerning
   their son, let them consider whence is the child which is begotten.
   For, granting the parent had not a son before his begetting, still,
   after having him, he had him, not as external or as foreign, but as
   from himself, and proper to his essence and his exact image, so that
   the former is beheld in the latter, and the latter is contemplated in
   the former. If then they assume from human examples that generation
   implies time, why not from the same infer that it implies the Natural
   and the Proper [1983] , instead of extracting serpent-like from the
   earth only what turns to poison? Those who ask of parents, and say, Had
   you a son before you begot him?' should add, And if you had a son, did
   you purchase him from without as a house or any other possession?' And
   then you would be answered, He is not from without, but from myself.
   For things which are from without are possessions, and pass from one to
   another; but my son is from me, proper and similar to my essence, not
   become mine from another, but begotten of me; wherefore I too am wholly
   in him, while I remain myself what I am [1984] .' For so it is; though
   the parent be distinct in time, as being man, who himself has come to
   be in time, yet he too would have had his child ever coexistent with
   him, but that his nature was a restraint and made it impossible. For
   Levi too was already in the loins of his great-grandfather, before his
   own actual generation, or that of his grandfather. When then the man
   comes to that age at which nature supplies the power, immediately, with
   nature, unrestrained, he becomes father of the son from himself.

   27. Therefore, if on asking parents about children, they get for
   answer, that children which are by nature are not from without, but
   from their parents, let them confess in like manner concerning the Word
   of God, that He is simply from the Father. And if they make a question
   of the time, let them say what is to restrain God--for it is necessary
   to prove their irreligion on the very ground on which their scoff is
   made--let them tell us, what is there to restrain God from being always
   Father of the Son; for that what is begotten must be from its father is
   undeniable. Moreover, they will pass judgment on themselves in
   attributing [1985] such things to God, if, as they questioned women on
   the subject of time, so they inquire of the sun concerning its
   radiance, and of the fountain concerning its issue. They will find that
   these, though an offspring, always exist with those things from which
   they are. And if parents, such as these, have in common with their
   children nature and duration, why, if they suppose God inferior to
   things that come to be [1986] , do they not openly say out their own
   irreligion? But if they do not dare to say this openly, and the Son is
   confessed to be, not from without, but a natural offspring from the
   Father, and that there is nothing which is a restraint to God (for not
   as man is He, but more than the sun, or rather the God of the sun), it
   follows that the Word is from Him and is ever co-existent with Him,
   through whom also the Father caused that all things which were not
   should be. That then the Son comes not of nothing but is eternal and
   from the Father, is certain even from the nature of the case; and the
   question of the heretics to parents exposes their perverseness; for
   they confess the point of nature, and now have been put to shame on the
   point of time.

   28. As we said above, so now we repeat, that the divine generation must
   not be compared to the nature of men, nor the Son considered to be part
   of God, nor the generation to imply any passion whatever; God is not as
   man; for men beget passibly, having a transitive nature, which waits
   for periods by reason of its weakness. But with God this cannot be; for
   He is not composed of parts, but being impassible and simple, He is
   impassibly and indivisibly Father of the Son. This again is strongly
   evidenced and proved by divine Scripture. For the Word of God is His
   Son, and the Son is the Father's Word and Wisdom; and Word and Wisdom
   is neither creature nor part of Him whose Word He is, nor an offspring
   passibly begotten. Uniting then the two titles, Scripture speaks of
   Son,' in order to herald the natural and true offspring of His essence;
   and, on the other hand, that none may think of the Offspring humanly,
   while signifying His essence, it also calls Him Word, Wisdom, and
   Radiance; to teach us that the generation was impassible, and eternal,
   and worthy of God. [1987] What affection then, or what part of the
   Father is the Word and the Wisdom and the Radiance? So much may be
   impressed even on these men of folly; for as they asked women
   concerning God's Son, so [1988] let them inquire of men concerning the
   Word, and they will find that the word which they put forth is neither
   an affection of them nor a part of their mind. But if such be the word
   of men, who are passible and partitive, why speculate they about
   passions and parts in the instance of the immaterial and indivisible
   God, that under pretence of reverence [1989] they may deny the true and
   natural generation of the Son? Enough was said above to shew that the
   offspring from God is not an affection; and now it has been shewn in
   particular that the Word is not begotten according to affection. The
   same may be said of Wisdom; God is not as man; nor must they here think
   humanly of Him. For, whereas men are capable of wisdom, God partakes in
   nothing, but is Himself the Father of His own Wisdom, of which whoso
   partake are given the name of wise. And this Wisdom too is not a
   passion, nor a part, but an Offspring proper to the Father. Wherefore
   He is ever Father, nor is the character of Father adventitious to God,
   lest He seem alterable; for if it is good that He be Father, but has
   not ever been Father, then good has not ever been in Him.

   29. But, observe, say they, God was always a Maker, nor is the power of
   framing adventitious to Him; does it follow then, that, because He is
   the Framer of all, therefore His works also are eternal, and is it
   wicked to say of them too, that they were not before origination?
   Senseless are these Arians; for what likeness is there between Son and
   work, that they should parallel a father's with a maker's function? How
   is it that, with that difference between offspring and work, which has
   been shewn, they remain so ill-instructed? Let it be repeated then,
   that a work is external to the nature, but a son is the proper
   offspring of the essence; it follows that a work need not have been
   always, for the workman frames it when he will; but an offspring is not
   subject to will, but is proper to the essence [1990] . And a man may be
   and may be called Maker, though the works are not as yet; but father he
   cannot be called, nor can he be, unless a son exist. And if they
   curiously inquire why God, though always with the power to make, does
   not always make (though this also be the presumption of madmen, for who
   hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His Counsellor?' or
   how shall the thing formed say to' the potter, why didst thou make me
   thus [1991] ?' however, not to leave even a weak argument unnoticed),
   they must be told, that although God always had the power to make, yet
   the things originated had not the power of being eternal [1992] . For
   they are out of nothing, and therefore were not before their
   origination; but things which were not before their origination, how
   could these coexist with the ever-existing God? Wherefore God, looking
   to what was good for them, then made them all when He saw that, when
   originated, they were able to abide. And as, though He was able, even
   from the beginning in the time of Adam, or Noah, or Moses, to send His
   own Word, yet He sent Him not until the consummation of the ages (for
   this He saw to be good for the whole creation), so also things
   originated did He make when He would, and as was good for them. But the
   Son, not being a work, but proper to the Father's offspring, always is;
   for, whereas the Father always is, so what is proper to His essence
   must always be; and this is His Word and His Wisdom. And that creatures
   should not be in existence, does not disparage the Maker; for He hath
   the power of framing them, when He wills; but for the offspring not to
   be ever with the Father, is a disparagement of the perfection of His
   essence. Wherefore His works were framed, when He would, through His
   Word; but the Son is ever the proper offspring of the Father's essence.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1983] Supr. de Decr. 6. The question was, What was that sense of Son
   which would apply to the Divine Nature? The Catholics said that its
   essential meaning could apply, viz. consubstantiality, whereas the
   point of posteriority to the Father depended on a condition, time,
   which could not exist in the instance of God. ib. 10. The Arians on the
   other hand said, that to suppose a true Son, was to think of God
   irreverently, as implying division, change, &c. The Catholics replied
   that the notion of materiality was quite as foreign from the Divine
   Essence as time, and as the Divine Sonship was eternal, so was it also
   clear both of imperfection or extension.

   [1984] It is from expressions such as this that the Greek Fathers have
   been accused of tritheism. The truth is, every illustration, as being
   incomplete on one or other side of it, taken by itself, tends to
   heresy. The title Son by itself suggests a second God, as the title
   Word a mere attribute, and the title Instrument a creature. All
   heresies are partial views of the truth, and are wrong, not so much in
   what they say, as in what they deny. The truth, on the other hand, is a
   positive and comprehensive doctrine, and in consequence necessarily
   mysterious and open to misconception. vid. de Syn. 41, note 1. When
   Athan, implies that the Eternal Father is in the Son, though remaining
   what He is, as a man in his child, he is intent only upon the point of
   the Son's connaturality and equality, which the Arians denied. Cf.
   Orat. iii. Â§5; Ps.-Ath. Dial. i. (Migne xxviii. 1144 C.). S. Cyril even
   seems to deny that each individual man may be considered a separate
   substance except as the Three Persons are such (Dial. i. p. 409); and
   S. Gregory Nyssen is led to say that, strictly speaking, the abstract
   man, which is predicated of separate individuals, is still one, and
   this with a view of illustrating the Divine Unity. ad Ablab. t. 2. p.
   449. vid. Petav. de Trin. iv. 9.

   [1985] [But see Or. iii. 65, note 2.]

   [1986] S. Athanasius's doctrine is, that, God containing in Himself all
   perfection, whatever is excellent in one created thing above another,
   is found in its perfection in Him. If then such generation as radiance
   from light is more perfect than that of children from parents, that
   belongs, and transcendently, to the All-perfect God.

   [1987] This is a view familiar to the Fathers, viz. that in this
   consists our Lord's Sonship, that He is the Word, or as S. Augustine
   says, Christum ideo Filium quia Verbum. Aug. Ep. 120. 11. Cf. de Decr.
   Â§17. If I speak of Wisdom, I speak of His offspring;' Theoph. ad
   Autolyc. i. 3. The Word, the genuine Son of Mind;' Clem. Protrept. p.
   58. Petavius discusses this subject accurately with reference to the
   distinction between Divine Generation and Divine Procession. de Trin.
   vii. 14.

   [1988] Orat. iii. 67.

   [1989] Heretics have frequently assigned reverence as the cause of
   their opposition to the Church; and if even Arius affected it, the plea
   may be expected in any other. O stultos et impios metus,' says S.
   Hilary, et irreligiosam de Deo sollicitudinem.' de Trin. iv. 6. It was
   still more commonly professed in regard to the Catholic doctrine of the
   Incarnation. Cf. Acta Archelai [Routh. Rell. v. 169]. August. contr.
   Secund. 9, contr. Faust. xi. 3. As the Manichees denied our Lord a
   body, so the Apollinarians denied Him a rational soul, still under
   pretence of reverence because, as they said, the soul was necessarily
   sinful. Leontius makes this their main argument, ho nous hamartetikos
   esti. de Sect. iv. p. 507. vid. also Greg. Naz. Ep. 101. ad Cledon. p.
   89; Athan. in Apoll. i. 2. 14. Epiph. Ancor. 79. 80. Athan., &c., call
   the Apollinarian doctrine ManichÃ¦an in consequence. vid. in Apoll. ii.
   8. 9. &c. Again, the Eranistes in Theodoret, who advocates a similar
   doctrine, will not call our Lord man. Eranist. ii. p. 83. Eutyches, on
   the other hand, would call our Lord man, but refused to admit His human
   nature, and still with the same profession. Leon. Ep. 21. 1 fin. Forbid
   it,' he says at Constantinople, that I should say that the Christ was
   of two natures, or should discuss the nature, phusiologein, of my God.'
   Concil. t. 2. p. 157 [Act. prima conc. Chalc. t. iv. 1001 ed. Col.] A
   modern argument for Universal Restitution takes a like form; Do not we
   shrink from the notion of another's being sentenced to eternal
   punishment; and are we more merciful than God?' vid. Matt. xvi. 22, 23.

   [1990] Vid. Orat. iii. Â§59, &c.

   [1991] Rom. xi. 34; ib. ix. 20.

   [1992] Athan.'s argument is as follows: that, as it is of the essence
   of a son to be connatural' with the father, so is it of the essence of
   a creature to be of nothing,' ex ouk onton; therefore, while it was not
   impossible from the nature of the case,' for Almighty God to be always
   Father, it was impossible for the same reason that He should be always
   a Creator. vid. infr. Â§58: where he takes, They shall perish,' in the
   Psalm, not as a fact but as the definition of the nature of a creature.
   Also ii. Â§1, where he says, It is proper to creatures and works to have
   said of them, ex ouk onton and ouk en prin gennethe.' vid. Cyril.

   in posse, vid. supra, Ep. Eus. 11 note 3.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter IX.--Objections Continued. Whether is the Unoriginate one or
   two? Inconsistent in Arians to use an unscriptural word; necessary to
   define its meaning. Different senses of the word. If it means without
   Father,' there is but One Unoriginate; if without beginning or
   creation,' there are two. Inconsistency of Asterius. Unoriginate' a
   title of God, not in contrast with the Son, but with creatures, as is
   Almighty,' or Lord of powers.' Father' is the truer title, as not only
   Scriptural, but implying a Son, and our adoption as sons.

   30. These considerations encourage the faithful, and distress the
   heretical, perceiving, as they do, their heresy overthrown thereby.
   Moreover, their further question, whether the Unoriginate be one or two
   [1993] ,' shews how false are their views, how treacherous and full of
   guile. Not for the Father's honour ask they this, but for the dishonour
   of the Word. Accordingly, should any one, not aware of their craft,
   answer, the Unoriginated is one,' forthwith they spirit out their own
   venom, saying, Therefore the Son is among things originated,' and well
   have we said, He was not before His generation.' Thus they make any
   kind of disturbance and confusion, provided they can but separate the
   Son from the Father, and reckon the Framer of all among His works. Now
   first they may be convicted on this score, that, while blaming the
   Nicene Bishops for their use of phrases not in Scripture, though these
   not injurious, but subversive of their irreligion, they themselves went
   off upon the same fault, that is, using words not in Scripture [1994] ,
   and those in contumely of the Lord, knowing neither what they say nor
   whereof they affirm [1995] .' For instance, let them ask the Greeks,
   who have been their instructors (for it is a word of their invention,
   not Scripture), and when they have been instructed in its various
   significations, then they will discover that they cannot even question
   properly, on the subject which they have undertaken. For they have led
   me to ascertain [1996] that by unoriginate' is meant what has not yet
   come to be, but is possible to be, as wood which is not yet become, but
   is capable of becoming, a vessel; and again what neither has nor ever
   can come to be, as a triangle quadrangular, and an even number odd. For
   a triangle neither has nor ever can become quadrangular; nor has even
   ever, nor can ever, become odd. Moreover, by unoriginate' is meant,
   what exists, but has not come into being from any, nor having a father
   at all. Further, Asterius, the unprincipled sophist, the patron too of
   this heresy, has added in his own treatise, that what is not made, but
   is ever, is unoriginate [1997] .' They ought then, when they ask the
   question, to add in what sense they take the word unoriginate,' and
   then the parties questioned would be able to answer to the point.

   31. But if they still are satisfied with merely asking, Is the
   Unoriginate one or two?' they must be told first of all, as
   ill-educated men, that many are such and nothing is such, many, which
   are capable of origination, and nothing, which is not capable, as has
   been said. But if they ask according as Asterius ruled it, as if what
   is not a work but was always' were unoriginate, then they must
   constantly be told that the Son as well as the Father must in this
   sense be called unoriginate. For He is neither in the number of things
   originated, nor a work, but has ever been with the Father, as has
   already been shewn, in spite of their many variations for the sole sake
   of speaking against the Lord, He is of nothing' and He was not before
   His generation.' When then, after failing at every turn, they betake
   themselves to the other sense of the question, existing but not
   generated of any nor having a father,' we shall tell them that the
   unoriginate in this sense is only one, namely the Father; and they will
   gain nothing by their question [1998] . For to say that God is in this
   sense Unoriginate, does not shew that the Son is a thing originated, it
   being evident from the above proofs that the Word is such as He is who
   begat Him. Therefore if God be unoriginate, His Image is not
   originated, but an Offspring [1999] , which is His Word and His Wisdom.
   For what likeness has the originated to the unoriginate? (one must not
   weary of using repetition;) for if they will have it that the one is
   like the other, so that he who sees the one beholds the other, they are
   like to say that the Unoriginate is the image of creatures; the end of
   which is a confusion of the whole subject, an equalling of things
   originated with the Unoriginate, and a denial of the Unoriginate by
   measuring Him with the works; and all to reduce the Son into their
   number.

   32. However, I suppose even they will be unwilling to proceed to such
   lengths, if they follow Asterius the sophist. For he, earnest as he is
   in his advocacy of the Arian heresy, and maintaining that the
   Unoriginate is one, runs counter to them in saying, that the Wisdom of
   God is unoriginate and without beginning also. The following is a
   passage out of his work [2000] : The Blessed Paul said not that he
   preached Christ the power of God or the wisdom of God, but, without the
   article, God's power and God's wisdom [2001] ;' thus preaching that the
   proper power of God Himself, which is natural to Him and co-existent
   with Him unoriginatedly, is something besides.' And again, soon after:
   However, His eternal power and wisdom, which truth argues to be without
   beginning and unoriginate; this must surely be one.' For though,
   misunderstanding the Apostle's words, he considered that there were two
   wisdoms; yet, by speaking still of a wisdom coexistent with Him, he
   declares that the Unoriginate is not simply one, but that there is
   another Unoriginate with Him. For what is coexistent, coexists not with
   itself, but with another. If then they agree with Asterius, let them
   never ask again, Is the Unoriginate one or two,' or they will have to
   contest the point with him; if, on the other hand, they differ even
   from him, let them not rely upon his treatise, lest, biting one
   another, they be consumed one of another [2002] .' So much on the point
   of their ignorance; but who can say enough on their crafty character?
   who but would justly hate them while possessed by such a madness? for
   when they were no longer allowed to say out of nothing' and He was not
   before His generation,' they hit upon this word unoriginate,' that, by
   saying among the simple that the Son was originate,' they might imply
   the very same phrases out of nothing,' and He once was not;' for in
   such phrases things originated and creatures are implied.

   33. If they have confidence in their own positions, they should stand
   to them, and not change about so variously [2003] ; but this they will
   not, from an idea that success is easy, if they do but shelter their
   heresy under colour of the word unoriginate.' Yet after all, this term
   is not used in contrast with the Son, clamour as they may, but with
   things originated; and the like may be found in the words Almighty,'
   and Lord of the Powers [2004] .' For if we say that the Father has
   power and mastery over all things by the Word, and the Son rules the
   Father's kingdom, and has the power of all, as His Word, and as the
   Image of the Father, it is quite plain that neither here is the Son
   reckoned among that all, nor is God called Almighty and Lord with
   reference to Him, but to those things which through the Son come to be,
   and over which He exercises power and mastery through the Word. And
   therefore the Unoriginate is specified not by contrast to the Son, but
   to the things which through the Son come to be. And excellently: since
   God is not as things originated, but is their Creator and Framer
   through the Son. And as the word Unoriginate' is specified relatively
   to things originated, so the word Father' is indicative of the Son. And
   he who names God Maker and Framer and Unoriginate, regards and
   apprehends things created and made; and he who calls God Father,
   thereby conceives and contemplates the Son. And hence one might marvel
   at the obstinacy which is added to their irreligion, that, whereas the
   term unoriginate' has the aforesaid good sense, and admits of being
   used religiously [2005] , they, in their own heresy, bring it forth for
   the dishonour of the Son, not having read that he who honoureth the Son
   honoureth the Father, and he who dishonoureth the Son, dishonoureth the
   Father [2006] . If they had any concern at all [2007] for reverent
   speaking and the honour due to the Father, it became them rather, and
   this were better and higher, to acknowledge and call God Father, than
   to give Him this name. For, in calling God unoriginate, they are, as I
   said before, calling Him from His works, and as Maker only and Framer,
   supposing that hence they may signify that the Word is a work after
   their own pleasure. But that he who calls God Father, signifies Him
   from the Son being well aware that if there be a Son, of necessity
   through that Son all things originate were created. And they, when they
   call Him Unoriginate, name Him only from His works, and know not the
   Son any more than the Greeks; but he who calls God Father, names Him
   from the Word; and knowing the Word, he acknowledges Him to be Framer
   of all, and understands that through Him all things have been made.

   34. Therefore it is more pious and more accurate to signify God from
   the Son and call Him Father, than to name Him from His works only and
   call Him Unoriginate [2008] . For the latter title, as I have said,
   does nothing more than signify all the works, individually and
   collectively, which have come to be at the will of God through the
   Word; but the title Father has its significance and its bearing only
   from the Son. And, whereas the Word surpasses things originated, by so
   much and more doth calling God Father surpass the calling Him
   Unoriginate. For the latter is unscriptural and suspicious, because it
   has various senses; so that, when a man is asked concerning it, his
   mind is carried about to many ideas; but the word Father is simple and
   scriptural, and more accurate, and only implies the Son. And
   Unoriginate' is a word of the Greeks, who know not the Son; but Father'
   has been acknowledged and vouchsafed by our Lord. For He, knowing
   Himself whose Son He was, said, I am in the Father, and the Father is
   in Me;' and, He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father,' and I and the
   Father are One [2009] ;' but nowhere is He found to call the Father
   Unoriginate. Moreover, when He teaches us to pray, He says not, When ye
   pray, say, O God Unoriginate,' but rather, When ye pray, say, Our
   Father, which art in heaven [2010] .' And it was His will that the
   Summary [2011] of our faith should have the same bearing, in bidding us
   be baptized, not into the name of Unoriginate and originate, nor into
   the name of Creator and creature, but into the Name of Father, Son, and
   Holy Ghost. For with such an initiation we too, being numbered among
   works, are made sons, and using the name of the Father, acknowledge
   from that name the Word also in the Father Himself [2012] . A vain
   thing then is their argument about the term Unoriginate,' as is now
   proved, and nothing more than a fantasy.

   [1993] The word angen[n]eton was in the philosophical schools
   synonymous with God;' hence by asking whether there were two
   Unoriginates, the Arians implied that there were two Gods, if Christ
   was God in the sense in which the Father was. Hence Athan. retorts,
   phaskontes, ou legomen duo ageneta, legousi duo theous. Orat. iii. 16,
   also ii. 38. Plato used agenneton of the Supreme God [not so; he used
   ageneton, see note 2 on de Decr. 28]; the Valentinians, Tertull. contr.
   Val. 7; and Basilides, Epiph. HÃ¦r. 31. 10. S. Clement uses it, see de
   Syn. 47, note 7. [The earlier Arians apparently argued mainly, like
   Asterius, from agenetos (cf. Epiph. 64. 8), the later (kainoi, Epiph.
   HÃ¦r. 73. 19) Anomoeans rather from agennetos]; viz. that he agennesia
   is the very ousia of God, not an attribute. So Aetius in Epiph. HÃ¦r.
   76. S. Athanasius does not go into this question, but rather confines
   himself to the more popular form of it, viz. the Son is by His very
   name not agenetos, but genetos, but all geneta are creatures; which he
   answers, as de Decr. Â§28, by saying that Christianity had brought in a
   new idea into theology, viz. the sacred doctrine of a true Son, ek tes
   ousias. This was what the Arians had originally denied hen to agenneton
   hen de to hup' autou alethos, kai ouk ek tes ousias autou gegonos.
   Euseb. Nic. ap. Theod. H. E. i. 6. When they were urged what according
   to them was the middle idea to which the Son answered, if they would
   not accept the Catholic, they would not define but merely said,
   gennema, all' ouk hos hen ton gennematon. [See pp. 149, 169, and the
   reference there to Lightfoot.]

   [1997] The two first senses here given answer to the two first
   mentioned, de Decr. Â§28. and, as he there says, are plainly irrelevant.
   The third in the de Decr. which, as he there observes, is ambiguous and
   used for a sophistical purpose, is here divided into third and fourth,
   answering to the two senses which alone are assigned in the de Syn. Â§46
   [where see note 5], and on them the question turns. This is an
   instance, of which many occur, how Athan. used his former writings and
   worked over again his former ground, and simplified or cleared what he
   had said. In the de Decr. after 350, we have three senses of ageneton,
   two irrelevant and the third ambiguous; here in Orat. i. (358), he
   divides the third into two; in the de Syn. (359), he rejects and omits
   the two first, leaving the two last, which are the critical senses.

   [1998] These two senses of agenneton unbegotten and unmade were
   afterwards [but see notes on de Decr. 28] expressed by the distinction
   of nn and n, agenneton and ageneton. vid. Damasc. F. O. i. 8. p. 135.

   This, which is not unfrequent with Athan., shews us the care with which
   he made his doctrinal statements, though they seem at first sight
   written off. It also accounts for the diffuseness and repetition which
   might be imputed to his composition, what seems superfluous being often

     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter X.--Objections Continued. How the Word has free will, yet
   without being alterable. He is unalterable because the Image of the
   Father, proved from texts.

   35. As to their question whether the Word is alterable [2013] , it is
   superfluous to examine it; it is enough simply to write down what they
   say, and so to shew its daring irreligion. How they trifle, appears
   from the following questions:--Has He free will, or has He not? is He
   good from choice according to free will, and can He, if He will, alter,
   being of an alterable nature? or, as wood or stone, has He not His
   choice free to be moved and incline hither and thither?' It is but
   agreeable to their heresy thus to speak and think; for, when once they
   have framed to themselves a God out of nothing and a created Son, of
   course they also adopt such terms, as being suitable to a creature.
   However, when in their controversies with Churchmen they hear from them
   of the real and only Word of the Father, and yet venture thus to speak
   of Him, does not their doctrine then become the most loathsome that can
   be found? is it not enough to distract a man on mere hearing, though
   unable to reply, and to make him stop his ears, from astonishment at
   the novelty of what he hears them say, which even to mention is to
   blaspheme? For if the Word be alterable and changing, where will He
   stay, and what will be the end of His development? how shall the
   alterable possibly be like the Unalterable? How should he who has seen
   the alterable, be considered to have seen the Unalterable? At what
   state must He arrive, for us to be able to behold in Him the Father?
   for it is plain that not at all times shall we see the Father in the
   Son, because the Son is ever altering, and is of changing nature. For
   the Father is unalterable and unchangeable, and is always in the same
   state and the same; but if, as they hold, the Son is alterable, and not
   always the same, but of an ever-changing nature, how can such a one be
   the Father's Image, not having the likeness of His unalterableness
   [2014] ? how can He be really in the Father, if His purpose is
   indeterminate? Nay, perhaps, as being alterable, and advancing daily,
   He is not perfect yet. But away with such madness of the Arians, and
   let the truth shine out, and shew that they are foolish. For must not
   He be perfect who is equal to God? and must not He be unalterable, who
   is one with the Father, and His Son proper to His essence? and the
   Father's essence being unalterable, unalterable must be also the proper
   Offspring from it. And if they slanderously impute alteration to the
   Word, let them learn how much their own reason is in peril; for from
   the fruit is the tree known. For this is why he who hath seen the Son
   hath seen the Father; and why the knowledge of the Son is knowledge of
   the Father.

   36. Therefore the Image of the unalterable God must be unchangeable;
   for Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever [2015] .'
   And David in the Psalm says of Him, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast
   laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Thine
   hands. They shall perish, but Thou remainest; and they all shall wax
   old as doth a garment. And as a vesture shalt Thou fold them up, and
   they shall be changed, but Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not
   fail [2016] .' And the Lord Himself says of Himself through the
   Prophet, See now that I, even I am He,' and I change not [2017] .' It
   may be said indeed that what is here signified relates to the Father;
   yet it suits the Son also to say this, specially because, when made
   man, He manifests His own identity and unalterableness to such as
   suppose that by reason of the flesh He is changed and become other than
   He was. More trustworthy are the saints, or rather the Lord, than the
   perversity of the irreligious. For Scripture, as in the above-cited
   passage of the Psalter, signifying under the name of heaven and earth,
   that the nature of all things originate and created is alterable and
   changeable, yet excepting the Son from these, shews us thereby that He
   is no wise a thing originate; nay teaches that He changes everything
   else, and is Himself not changed, in saying, Thou art the same, and Thy
   years shall not fail [2018] .' And with reason; for things originate,
   being from nothing [2019] , and not being before their origination,
   because, in truth, they come to be after not being, have a nature which
   is changeable; but the Son, being from the Father, and proper to His
   essence, is unchangeable and unalterable as the Father Himself. For it
   were sin to say that from that essence which is unalterable was
   begotten an alterable word and a changeable wisdom. For how is He
   longer the Word, if He be alterable? or can that be Wisdom which is
   changeable? unless perhaps, as accident in essence [2020] , so they
   would have it, viz. as in any particular essence, a certain grace and
   habit of virtue exists accidentally, which is called Word and Son and
   Wisdom, and admits of being taken from it and added to it. For they
   have often expressed this sentiment, but it is not the faith of
   Christians; as not declaring that He is truly Word and Son of God, or
   that the wisdom intended is true Wisdom. For what alters and changes,
   and has no stay in one and the same condition, how can that be true?
   whereas the Lord says, I am the Truth [2021] .' If then the Lord
   Himself speaks thus concerning Himself, and declares His
   unalterableness, and the Saints have learned and testify this, nay and
   our notions of God acknowledge it as religious, whence did these men of
   irreligion draw this novelty? From their heart as from a seat of
   corruption did they vomit it forth [2022] .

   Chapter XI.--Texts Explained; And First, Phil. II. 9, 10 Various texts
   which are alleged against the Catholic doctrine: e.g. Phil. ii. 9, 10.
   Whether the words Wherefore God hath highly exalted' prove moral
   probation and advancement. Argued against, first, from the force of the
   word Son;' which is inconsistent with such an interpretation. Next, the
   passage examined. Ecclesiastical sense of highly exalted,' and gave,'
   and wherefore;' viz. as being spoken with reference to our Lord's
   manhood. Secondary sense; viz. as implying the Word's exaltation'
   through the resurrection in the same sense in which Scripture speaks of
   His descent in the Incarnation; how the phrase does not derogate from
   the nature of the Word.

   37. But since they allege the divine oracles and force on them a
   misinterpretation, according to their private sense [2023] , it becomes
   necessary to meet them just so far as to vindicate these passages, and
   to shew that they bear an orthodox sense, and that our opponents are in
   error. They say then, that the Apostle writes, Wherefore God also hath
   highly exalted Him, and given Him a Name which is above every name;
   that in the Name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven
   and things in earth and things under the earth [2024] ;' and David,
   Wherefore God even Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness
   above Thy fellows [2025] .' Then they urge, as something acute: If He
   was exalted and received grace, on a wherefore,' and on a wherefore' He
   was anointed, He received a reward of His purpose; but having acted
   from purpose, He is altogether of an alterable nature.' This is what
   Eusebius [2026] and Arius have dared to say, nay to write; while their
   partizans do not shrink from conversing about it in full market-place,
   not seeing how mad an argument they use. For if He received what He had
   as a reward of His purpose, and would not have had it, unless He had
   needed it, and had His work to shew for it, then having gained it from
   virtue and promotion, with reason had He therefore' been called Son and
   God, without being very Son. For what is from another by nature, is a
   real offspring, as Isaac was to Abraham, and Joseph to Jacob, and the
   radiance to the sun; but the so called sons from virtue and grace, have
   but in place of nature a grace by acquisition, and are something else
   besides [2027] the gift itself; as the men who have received the Spirit
   by participation, concerning whom Scripture saith, I begat and exalted
   children, and they rebelled against Me [2028] .' And of course, since
   they were not sons by nature, therefore, when they altered, the Spirit
   was taken away and they were disinherited; and again on their
   repentance that God who thus at the beginning gave them grace, will
   receive them, and give light, and call them sons again.

   38. But if they say this of the Saviour also, it follows that He is
   neither very God nor very Son, nor like the Father, nor in any wise has
   God for a Father of His being according to essence, but of the mere
   grace given to Him, and for a Creator of His being according to
   essence, after the similitude of all others. And being such, as they
   maintain, it will be manifest further that He had not the name Son'
   from the first, if so be it was the prize of works done and of that
   very same advance which He made when He became man, and took the form
   of the servant; but then, when, after becoming obedient unto death,' He
   was, as the text says, highly exalted,' and received that Name' as a
   grace, that in the Name of Jesus every knee should bow [2029] .' What
   then was before this, if then He was exalted, and then began to be
   worshipped, and then was called Son, when He became man? For He seems
   Himself not to have promoted the flesh at all, but rather to have been
   Himself promoted through it, if, according to their perverseness, He
   was then exalted and called Son, when He became man. What then was
   before this? One must urge the question on them again, to make it
   understood what their irreligious doctrine results in [2030] . For if
   the Lord be God, Son, Word, yet was not all these before He became man,
   either He was something else beside these, and afterwards became
   partaker of them for His virtue's sake, as we have said; or they must
   adopt the alternative (may it return upon their heads!) that He was not
   before that time, but is wholly man by nature and nothing more. But
   this is no sentiment of the Church. but of the Samosatene and of the
   present Jews. Why then, if they think as Jews, are they not circumcised
   with them too, instead of pretending Christianity, while they are its
   foes? For if He was not, or was indeed, but afterwards was promoted,
   how were all things made by Him, or how in Him, were He not perfect,
   did the Father delight [2031] ? And He, on the other hand, if now
   promoted, how did He before rejoice in the presence of the Father? And,
   if He received His worship after dying, how is Abraham seen to worship
   Him in the tent [2032] , and Moses in the bush? and, as Daniel saw,
   myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands were ministering unto
   Him? And if, as they say, He had His promotion now, how did the Son
   Himself make mention of that His glory before and above the world, when
   He said, Glorify Thou Me, O Father, with the glory which I had with
   Thee before the world was [2033] .' If, as they say, He was then
   exalted, how did He before that bow the heavens and come down;' and
   again, The Highest gave His thunder [2034] ?' Therefore, if, even
   before the world was made, the Son had that glory, and was Lord of
   glory and the Highest, and descended from heaven, and is ever to be
   worshipped, it follows that He had not promotion from His descent, but
   rather Himself promoted the things which needed promotion; and if He
   descended to effect their promotion, therefore He did not receive in
   reward the name of the Son and God, but rather He Himself has made us
   sons of the Father, and deified men by becoming Himself man.

   39. Therefore He was not man, and then became God, but He was God, and
   then became man, and that to deify us [2035] . Since, if when He became
   man, only then He was called Son and God, but before He became man, God
   called the ancient people sons, and made Moses a god of Pharaoh (and
   Scripture says of many, God standeth in the congregation of Gods [2036]
   '), it is plain that He is called Son and God later than they. How then
   are all things through Him, and He before all? or how is He first-born
   of the whole creation [2037] ,' if He has others before Him who are
   called sons and gods? And how is it that those first partakers [2038]
   do not partake of the Word? This opinion is not true; it is a device of
   our present Judaizers. For how in that case can any at all know God as
   their Father? for adoption there could not be apart from the real Son,
   who says, No one knoweth the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever
   the Son will reveal Him [2039] .' And how can there be deifying apart
   from the Word and before Him? yet, saith He to their brethren the Jews,
   If He called them gods, unto whom the Word of God came [2040] .' And if
   all that are called sons and gods, whether in earth or in heaven, were
   adopted and deified through the Word, and the Son Himself is the Word,
   it is plain that through Him are they all, and He Himself before all,
   or rather He Himself only is very Son [2041] , and He alone is very God
   from the very God, not receiving these prerogatives as a reward for His
   virtue, nor being another beside them, but being all these by nature
   and according to essence. For He is Offspring of the Father's essence,
   so that one cannot doubt that after the resemblance of the unalterable
   Father, the Word also is unalterable.

   40. Hitherto we have met their irrational conceits with the true
   conceptions [2042] implied in the Word Son,' as the Lord Himself has
   given us. But it will be well next to cite the divine oracles, that the
   unalterableness of the Son and His unchangeable nature, which is the
   Father's, as well as their perverseness, may be still more fully
   proved. The Apostle then, writing to the Philippians, says, Have this
   mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus; who, being in the form of
   God, thought it not a prize to be equal with God; but emptied Himself,
   taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men. And,
   being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient
   to death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also highly
   exalted Him, and gave Him a Name which is above every name; that in the
   Name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in
   earth, and things under the earth, and that every tongue should confess
   that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father [2043] .' Can
   anything be plainer and more express than this? He was not from a lower
   state promoted: but rather, existing as God, He took the form of a
   servant, and in taking it, was not promoted but humbled Himself. Where
   then is there here any reward of virtue, or what advancement and
   promotion in humiliation? For if, being God, He became man, and
   descending from on high He is still said to be exalted, where is He
   exalted, being God? this withal being plain, that, since God is highest
   of all, His Word must necessarily be highest also. Where then could He
   be exalted higher, who is in the Father and like the Father in all
   things [2044] ? Therefore He is beyond the need of any addition; nor is
   such as the Arians think Him. For though the Word has descended in
   order to be exalted, and so it is written, yet what need was there that
   He should humble Himself, as if to seek that which He had already? And
   what grace did He receive who is the Giver of grace [2045] ? or how did
   He receive that Name for worship, who is always worshipped by His Name?
   Nay, certainly before He became man, the sacred writers invoke Him,
   Save me, O God, for Thy Name's sake [2046] ;'and again, Some put their
   trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we will remember the Name of
   the Lord our God [2047] .' And while He was worshipped by the
   Patriarchs, concerning the Angels it is written, Let all the Angels of
   God worship Him [2048] .'

   41. And if, as David says in the 71st Psalm, His Name remaineth before
   the sun, and before the moon, from one generation to another [2049] ,'
   how did He receive what He had always, even before He now received it?
   or how is He exalted, being before His exaltation the Most High? or how
   did He receive the right of being worshipped, who before He now
   received it, was ever worshipped? It is not a dark saying but a divine
   mystery [2050] . In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
   God, and the Word was God;' but for our sakes afterwards the Word was
   made flesh [2051] .' And the term in question, highly exalted,' does
   not signify that the essence of the Word was exalted, for He was ever
   and is equal to God [2052] ,' but the exaltation is of the manhood.
   Accordingly this is not said before the Word became flesh; that it
   might be plain that humbled' and exalted' are spoken of His human
   nature; for where there is humble estate, there too may be exaltation;
   and if because of His taking flesh humbled' is written, it is clear
   that highly exalted' is also said because of it. For of this was man's
   nature in want, because of the humble estate of the flesh and of death.
   Since then the Word, being the Image of the Father and immortal, took
   the form of the servant, and as man underwent for us death in His
   flesh, that thereby He might offer Himself for us through death to the
   Father; therefore also, as man, He is said because of us and for us to
   be highly exalted, that as by His death we all died in Christ, so again
   in the Christ Himself we might be highly exalted, being raised from the
   dead, and ascending into heaven, whither the forerunner Jesus is for us
   entered, not into the figures of the true, but into heaven itself, now
   to appear in the presence of God for us [2053] .' But if now for us the
   Christ is entered into heaven itself, though He was even before and
   always Lord and Framer of the heavens, for us therefore is that present
   exaltation written. And as He Himself, who sanctifies all, says also
   that He sanctifies Himself to the Father for our sakes, not that the
   Word may become holy, but that He Himself may in Himself sanctify all
   of us, in like manner we must take the present phrase, He highly
   exalted Him,' not that He Himself should be exalted, for He is the
   highest, but that He may become righteousness for us [2054] , and we
   may be exalted in Him, and that we may enter the gates of heaven, which
   He has also opened for us, the forerunners saying, Lift up your gates,
   O ye rulers, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of
   Glory shall come in [2055] .' For here also not on Him were shut the
   gates, as being Lord and Maker of all, but because of us is this too
   written, to whom the door of paradise was shut. And therefore in a
   human relation, because of the flesh which He bore, it is said of Him,
   Lift up your gates,' and shall come in,' as if a man were entering; but
   in a divine relation on the other hand it is said of Him, since the
   Word was God,' that He is the Lord' and the King of Glory.' Such our
   exaltation the Spirit foreannounced in the eighty-ninth Psalm, saying,
   And in Thy righteousness shall they be exalted, for Thou art the glory
   of their strength [2056] .' And if the Son be Righteousness, then He is
   not exalted as being Himself in need, but it is we who are exalted in
   that Righteousness, which is He [2057] .

   42. And so too the words gave Him' are not written because of the Word
   Himself; for even before He became man He was worshipped, as we have
   said, by the Angels and the whole creation in virtue of being proper to
   the Father; but because of us and for us this too is written of Him.
   For as Christ died and was exalted as man, so, as man, is He said to
   take what, as God, He ever had, that even such a grant of grace might
   reach to us. For the Word was not impaired in receiving a body, that He
   should seek to receive a grace, but rather He deified that which He put
   on, and more than that, gave' it graciously to the race of man. For as
   He was ever worshipped as being the Word and existing in the form of
   God, so being what He ever was, though become man and called Jesus, He
   none the less has the whole creation under foot, and bending their
   knees to Him in this Name, and confessing that the Word's becoming
   flesh, and undergoing death in flesh, has not happened against the
   glory of His Godhead, but to the glory of God the Father.' For it is
   the Father's glory that man, made and then lost, should be found again;
   and, when dead, that he should be made alive, and should become God's
   temple. For whereas the powers in heaven, both Angels and Archangels,
   were ever worshipping the Lord, as they are now worshipping Him in the
   Name of Jesus, this is our grace and high exaltation, that even when He
   became man, the Son of God is worshipped, and the heavenly powers will
   not be astonished at seeing all of us, who are of one body with Him
   [2058] , introduced into their realms. And this had not been, unless He
   who existed in the form of God had taken on Him a servant's form, and
   had humbled Himself, yielding His body to come unto death.

   43. Behold then what men considered the foolishness of God because of
   the Cross, has become of all things most honoured. For our resurrection
   is stored up in it; and no longer Israel alone, but henceforth all the
   nations, as the Prophet hath foretold, leave their idols and
   acknowledge the true God, the Father of the Christ. And the illusion of
   demons is come to nought, and He only who is really God is worshipped
   in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ [2059] . For the fact that the
   Lord, even when come in human body and called Jesus, was worshipped and
   believed to be God's Son, and that through Him the Father was known,
   shows, as has been said, that not the Word, considered as the Word,
   received this so great grace, but we. For because of our relationship
   to His Body we too have become God's temple, and in consequence are
   made God's sons, so that even in us the Lord is now worshipped, and
   beholders report, as the Apostle says, that God is in them of a truth
   [2060] . As also John says in the Gospel, As many as received Him, to
   them gave He power to become children of God [2061] ;' and in his
   Epistle he writes, By this we know that He abideth in us by His Spirit
   which He hath given us [2062] .' And this too is an evidence of His
   goodness towards us that, while we were exalted because that the
   Highest Lord is in us, and on our account grace was given to Him,
   because that the Lord who supplies the grace has become a man like us,
   He on the other hand, the Saviour, humbled Himself in taking our body
   of humiliation [2063] ,' and took a servant's form, putting on that
   flesh which was enslaved to sin [2064] . And He indeed has gained
   nothing from us for His own promotion: for the Word of God is without
   want and full; but rather we were promoted from Him; for He is the
   Light, which lighteneth every man, coming into the world [2065] .' And
   in vain do the Arians lay stress upon the conjunction wherefore,'
   because Paul has said, Wherefore, hath God highly exalted Him.' For in
   saying this he did not imply any prize of virtue, nor promotion from
   advance [2066] , but the cause why the exaltation was bestowed upon us.
   And what is this but that He who existed in form of God, the Son of a
   noble [2067] Father, humbled Himself and became a servant instead of us
   and in our behalf? For if the Lord had not become man, we had not been
   redeemed from sins, not raised from the dead, but remaining dead under
   the earth; not exalted into heaven, but lying in Hades. Because of us
   then and in our behalf are the words, highly exalted' and given.'

   44. This then I consider the sense of this passage, and that, a very
   ecclesiastical sense [2068] . However, there is another way in which
   one might remark upon it, giving the same sense in a parallel way; viz.
   that, though it does not speak of the exaltation of the Word Himself,
   so far as He is Word [2069] (for He is, as was just now said, most high
   and like His Father), yet by reason of His becoming man it indicates
   His resurrection from the dead. For after saying, He hath humbled
   Himself even unto death,' He immediately added, Wherefore He hath
   highly exalted Him;' wishing to shew, that, although as man He is said
   to have died, yet, as being Life, He was exalted on the resurrection;
   for He who descended, is the same also who rose again [2070] .' He
   descended in body, and He rose again because He was God Himself in the
   body. And this again is the reason why according to this meaning he
   brought in the conjunction Wherefore;' not as a reward of virtue nor of
   advancement, but to signify the cause why the resurrection took place;
   and why, while all other men from Adam down to this time have died and
   remained dead, He only rose in integrity from the dead. The cause is
   this, which He Himself has already taught us, that, being God, He has
   become man. For all other men, being merely born of Adam, died, and
   death reigned over them; but He, the Second Man, is from heaven, for
   the Word was made flesh [2071] ,' and this Man is said to be from
   heaven and heavenly [2072] , because the Word descended from heaven;
   wherefore He was not held under death. For though He humbled Himself,
   yielding His own Body to come unto death, in that it was capable of
   death [2073] , yet He was highly exalted from earth, because He was
   God's Son in a body. Accordingly what is here said, Wherefore God also
   hath highly exalted Him,' answers to Peter's words in the Acts, Whom
   God raised up, having loosed the bonds of death, because it was not
   possible that He should be holden of it [2074] .' For as Paul has
   written, Since being in form of God He became man, and humbled Himself
   unto death, therefore God also hath highly exalted Him,' so also Peter
   says, Since, being God, He became man, and signs and wonders proved Him
   to beholders to be God, therefore it was not possible that He should be
   holden of death.' To man it was not possible to succeed in this; for
   death belongs to man; wherefore, the Word, being God, became flesh,
   that, being put to death in the flesh, He might quicken all men by His
   own power.

   45. But since He Himself is said to be exalted,' and God gave' Him, and
   the heretics think this a defect [2075] or affection in the essence
   [2076] of the Word, it becomes necessary to explain how these words are
   used. He is said to be exalted from the lower parts of the earth,
   because death is ascribed even to Him. Both events are reckoned His,
   since it was His Body [2077] , and none other's, that was exalted from
   the dead and taken up into heaven. And again, the Body being His, and
   the Word not being external to it, it is natural that when the Body was
   exalted, He, as man, should, because of the body, be spoken of as
   exalted. If then He did not become man, let this not be said of Him:
   but if the Word became flesh, of necessity the resurrection and
   exaltation, as in the case of a man, must be ascribed to Him, that the
   death which is ascribed to Him may be a redemption of the sin of men
   and an abolition of death, and that the resurrection and exaltation may
   for His sake remain secure for us. In both respects he hath said of
   Him, God hath highly exalted Him,' and God hath given to Him;' that
   herein moreover he may show that it is not the Father that hath become
   flesh, but it is His Word, who has become man, and receives after the
   manner of men from the Father, and is exalted by Him, as has been said.
   And it is plain, nor would any one dispute it, that what the Father
   gives, He gives through. the Son. And it is marvellous and overwhelming
   verily; for the grace which the Son gives from the Father, that the Son
   Himself is said to receive; and the exaltation, which the Son bestows
   from the Father, with that the Son is Himself exalted. For He who is
   the Son of God, became Himself the Son of Man; and, as Word, He gives
   from the Father, for all things which the Father does and gives, He
   does and supplies through Him; and as the Son of Man, He Himself is
   said after the manner of men to receive what proceeds from Him, because
   His Body is none other than His, and is a natural recipient of grace,
   as has been said. For He received it as far as His man's nature [2078]
   was exalted; which exaltation was its being deified. But such an
   exaltation the Word Himself always had according to the Father's
   Godhead and perfection, which was His [2079] .

   [2030] The Arians perhaps more than other heretics were remarkable for
   bringing objections against the received view, rather than forming a
   consistent theory of their own. Indeed the very vigour and success of
   their assault upon the truth lay in its being a mere assault, not a
   positive and substantive teaching. They therefore, even more than
   others, might fairly be urged on to the consequences of their
   positions. Now the text in question, as it must be interpreted if it is
   to serve as an objection, was an objection also to the received
   doctrine of the Arians. They considered that our Lord was above and
   before all creatures from the first, and their Creator; how then could
   He be exalted above all? They surely, as much as Catholics, were
   obliged to explain it of our Lord's manhood. They could not then use it
   as a weapon against the Church, until they took the ground of Paul of
   Samosata.

   [2038] In this passage Athan. considers that the participation of the
   Word is deification, as communion with the Son is adoption: also that
   the old Saints, inasmuch as they are called gods' and sons,' did
   partake of the Divine Word and Son, or in other words were gifted with
   the Spirit. He asserts the same doctrine very strongly in Orat. iv.
   Â§22. On the other hand, infr. 47, he says expressly that Christ
   received the Spirit in Baptism that He might give it to man.' There is
   no real contradiction in such statements; what was given in one way
   under the Law, was given in another and fuller under the Gospel.

   [2050] Scripture is full of mysteries, but they are mysteries of fact,
   not of words. Its dark sayings or Ã¦nigmata are such, because in the
   nature of things they cannot be expressed clearly. Hence contrariwise,
   Orat. ii. Â§77 fin. he calls Prov. viii. 22. an enigma, with an allusion
   to Prov. i. 6. Sept. In like manner S. Ambrose says, Mare est scriptura
   divina, habens in se sensus profundos, et altitudinem propheticorum
   Ã¦nigmatum, &c. Ep. ii. 3. What is commonly called explaining away'
   Scripture, is this transference of the obscurity from the subject to
   the words used.

   [2054] When Scripture says that our Lord was exalted, it means in that
   sense in which He could be exalted; just as, in saying that a man walks
   or eats, we speak of him not as a spirit, but as in that system of
   things to which the ideas of walking and eating belong. Exaltation is
   not a word which can belong to God; it is unmeaning, and therefore is
   not applied to Him in the text in question. Thus, e.g. S. Ambrose: Ubi
   humiliatus, ibi obediens. Ex eo enim nascitur obedientia, ex quo

   [2064] It was usual to say against the Apollinarians, that, unless our
   Lord took on Him our nature, as it is, He had not purified and changed
   it, as it is, but another nature; The Lord came not to save Adam as
   free from sin, that He should become like unto him; but as, in the net
   of sin and now fallen, that God's mercy might raise him up with
   Christ.' Leont. contr. Nestor. &c. ii. p. 996. Accordingly, Athan. says
   elsewhere, Had not sinlessness appeared [cf. Rom. viii. 3, pempsas] "in
   the nature which had sinned," how was sin condemned in the flesh?' in
   Apoll. ii. 6. It was necessary for our salvation,' says S. Cyril, that
   the Word of God should become man, that human flesh "subject to
   corruption" and "sick with the lust of pleasures," He might make His
   own; and, "whereas He is life and lifegiving," He might "destroy the
   corruption," &c....For by this means, might sin in our flesh become
   dead.' Ep. ad Success. i. p. 138. And S. Leo, Non alterius naturÃ¦ erat
   ejus caro quam nostra, nec alio illi quam cÃ¦teris hominibus anima est
   inspirata principio, quÃ¦ excelleret, non diversitate generis, sed
   sublimitate virtutis.' Ep. 35 fin. vid. also Ep. 28. 3. Ep. 31. 2. Ep.
   165. 9. Serm. 22. 2. and 25. 5. It may be asked whether this doctrine
   does not interfere with that of the immaculate conception [i.e. that
   Christ was conceived sinless]; but that miracle was wrought in order
   that our Lord might not be born in original sin, and does not affect,
   or rather includes, His taking flesh of the substance of the Virgin,
   i.e. of a fallen nature. If indeed sin were of the substance' of our
   fallen nature, as some heretics have said, then He could not have taken
   our nature without partaking our sinfulness; but if sin be, as it is, a
   fault of the will, then the Divine Power of the Word could sanctify the
   human will, and keep it from swerving in the direction of evil. Hence
   We say not that Christ by the felicity of a flesh separated from sense
   could not feel the desire of sin, but that by perfection of virtue, and
   by a flesh not begotten through concupiscence of the flesh, He had not
   the desire of sin;' Aug. Op. Imperf. iv. 48. On the other hand, S.
   Athanasius expressly calls it Manichean doctrine to consider ten phusin
   of the flesh hamartian, kai ou ten praxin. contr. Apoll. i. 12 fin. or
   phusiken einai ten hamartian. ibid. i. 14 fin. His argument in the next
   ch. is on the ground that all natures are from God, but God made man
   upright nor is the author of evil (vid. also Vit. Anton. 20); not as
   if,' he says, the devil wrought in man a nature (God forbid!) for of a
   nature the evil cannot be maker (demiourgos) as is the impiety of the
   Manichees, but he wrought a bias of nature by transgression, and so
   death reigned over all men.' Wherefore, saith he, the Son of God came
   to destroy the works of the devil;' what works? that nature, which God
   made sinless, and the devil biassed to the transgression of God's
   command and the finding out of sin which is death, did God the Word
   raise again, so as to be secure from the devil's bias and the finding
   out of sin. And therefore the Lord said, "The prince of this world
   cometh and findeth nothing in Me."' vid. also Â§19. Ibid. ii. 6. he
   speaks of the devil having introduced the law of sin.' vid. also Â§9.

   [2073] It was a point in controversy with the extreme Monophysites,
   that is, the Eutychians, whether our Lord's body was naturally subject
   to death, the Catholics maintaining the affirmative, as Athanasius
   here. Eutyches asserted that our Lord had not a human nature, by which
   he meant among other things that His manhood was not subject to the
   laws of a body, but so far as He submitted to them, He did so by an act
   of will in each particular case; and this, lest it should seem that He
   was moved by the pathe against His will akousios; and consequently that
   His manhood was not subject to death. But the Catholics maintained that
   He had voluntarily placed Himself under those laws, and died naturally,
   vid. Athan. contr. Apol. i. 17, and that after the resurrection His
   body became incorruptible, not according to nature, but by grace. vid.
   Leont. de Sect. x. p. 530. Anast. Hodeg. c. 23. To express their
   doctrine of the huperphues of our Lord's manhood the Eutychians made
   use of the Catholic expression ut voluit.' vid. Athan. l.c. Eutyches

   [2076] At first sight it would seem as if S. Athanasius here used ousia
   essence for subsistence, or person; but this is not true except with an
   explanation. Its direct meaning is here, as usual, essence, though
   indirectly it comes to imply subsistence. He is speaking of that Divine
   Essence which, though also the Almighty Father's, is as simply and
   entirely the Word's as if it were only His. Nay, even when the Essence
   of the Father is spoken of in a sort of contrast to that of the Son, as
   in the phrase ousia ex ousias, harsh as such expressions are, it is not
   accurate to say that ousia is used for subsistence or person, or that
   two ousiai are spoken of (vid. de Syn. 52, note 8), except, that is, by
   Arians, as Eusebius, supr. Ep. Eus. Â§6 [or by Origen, Prolegg. ii. Â§3
   (2) a.] Just below we find phusis tou logou, Â§51 init.

   [2077] This was the question which came into discussion in the
   Nestorian controversy, when, as it was then expressed, all that took
   place in respect to the Eternal Word as man, belonged to His Person,
   and therefore might be predicated of Him; so that it was heretical not
   to confess the Word's body (or the body of God in the Person of the
   Word), the Word's death (as Athan, in the text), the Word's exaltation,
   and the Word's, or God's, Mother, who was in consequence called
   theotokos, which was the expression on which the controversy mainly
   turned. Cf. Orat. iii. 31, a passage as precise as if it had been
   written after the Nestorian and Eutychian controversies, though without
   the technical words then adopted.

   Chapter XII.--Texts Explained; Secondly, Psalm xlv. 7, 8. Whether the
   words therefore,' anointed,' &c., imply that the Word has been
   rewarded. Argued against first from the word fellows' or partakers.' He
   is anointed with the Spirit in His manhood to sanctify human nature.
   Therefore the Spirit descended on Him in Jordan, when in the flesh. And
   He is said to sanctify Himself for us, and give us the glory He has
   received. The word wherefore' implies His divinity. Thou hast loved
   righteousness,' &c., do not imply trial or choice.

   46. Such an explanation of the Apostle's words confutes the irreligious
   men; and what the sacred poet says admits also the same orthodox sense,
   which they misinterpret, but which in the Psalmist is manifestly
   religious. He says then, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a
   sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of Thy Kingdom. Thou hast loved
   righteousness, and hated iniquity, therefore God, even Thy God, hath
   anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows [2080] .'
   Behold, O ye Arians, and acknowledge even hence the truth. The Singer
   speaks of us all as fellows' or partakers' of the Lord: but were He one
   of things which come out of nothing and of things originate, He Himself
   had been one of those who partake. But, since he hymned Him as the
   eternal God, saying, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever,' and has
   declared that all other things partake of Him, what conclusion must we
   draw, but that He is distinct from originated things, and He only the
   Father's veritable Word, Radiance, and Wisdom, which all things
   originate partake [2081] , being sanctified by Him in the Spirit [2082]
   ? And therefore He is here anointed,' not that He may become God, for
   He was so even before; nor that He may become King, for He had the
   Kingdom eternally, existing as God's Image, as the sacred Oracle shews;
   but in our behalf is this written, as before. For the Israelitish
   kings, upon their being anointed, then became kings, not being so
   before, as David, as Hezekiah, as Josiah, and the rest; but the Saviour
   on the contrary, being God, and ever ruling in the Father's Kingdom,
   and being Himself He that supplies the Holy Ghost, nevertheless is here
   said to be anointed, that, as before, being said as man to be anointed
   with the Spirit, He might provide for us men, not only exaltation and
   resurrection, but the indwelling and intimacy of the Spirit. And
   signifying this the Lord Himself hath said by His own mouth in the
   Gospel according to John, I have sent them into the world, and for
   their sakes do I sanctify Myself, that they may be sanctified in the
   truth [2083] .' In saying this He has shown that He is not the
   sanctified, but the Sanctifier; for He is not sanctified by other, but
   Himself sanctifies Himself, that we may be sanctified in the truth. He
   who sanctifies Himself is Lord of sanctification. How then does this
   take place? What does He mean but this? I, being the Father's Word, I
   give to Myself, when becoming man, the Spirit; and Myself, become man,
   do I sanctify in Him, that henceforth in Me, who am Truth (for "Thy
   Word is Truth"), all may be sanctified.'

   47. If then for our sake He sanctifies Himself, and does this when He
   is become man, it is very plain that the Spirit's descent on Him in
   Jordan was a descent upon us, because of His bearing our body. And it
   did not take place for promotion to the Word, but again for our
   sanctification, that we might share His anointing, and of us it might
   be said, Know ye not that ye are God's Temple, and the Spirit of God
   dwelleth in you [2084] ?' For when the Lord, as man, was washed in
   Jordan, it was we who were washed in Him and by Him [2085] . And when
   He received the Spirit, we it was who by Him were made recipients of
   It. And moreover for this reason, not as Aaron or David or the rest,
   was He anointed with oil, but in another way above all His fellows,
   with the oil of gladness,' which He Himself interprets to be the
   Spirit, saying by the Prophet, The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me,
   because the Lord hath anointed Me [2086] ;' as also the Apostle has
   said, How God anointed Him with the Holy Ghost. [2087] ' When then were
   these things spoken of Him but when He came in the flesh and was
   baptized in Jordan, and the Spirit descended on Him? And indeed the
   Lord Himself said, The Spirit shall take of Mine;' and I will send
   Him;' and to His disciples, Receive ye the Holy Ghost [2088] .' And
   notwithstanding, He who, as the Word and Radiance of the Father, gives
   to others, now is said to be sanctified, because now He has become man,
   and the Body that is sanctified is His. From Him then we have begun to
   receive the unction and the seal, John saying, And ye have an unction
   from the Holy One;' and the Apostle, And ye were sealed with the Holy
   Spirit of promise [2089] .' Therefore because of us and for us are
   these words. What advance then of promotion, and reward of virtue or
   generally of conduct, is proved from this in our Lord's instance? For
   if He was not God, and then had become God, if not being King He was
   preferred to the Kingdom, your reasoning would have had some faint
   plausibility. But if He is God and the throne of His kingdom is
   everlasting, in what way could God advance? or what was there wanting
   to Him who was sitting on His Father's throne? And if, as the Lord
   Himself has said, the Spirit is His, and takes of His, and He sends It,
   it is not the Word, considered as the Word and Wisdom, who is anointed
   with the Spirit which He Himself gives, but the flesh assumed by Him
   which is anointed in Him and by Him [2090] ; that the sanctification
   coming to the Lord as man, may come to all men from Him. For not of
   Itself, saith He, doth the Spirit speak, but the Word is He who gives
   It to the worthy. For this is like the passage considered above; for as
   the Apostle has written, Who existing in form of God thought it not a
   prize to be equal with God, but emptied Himself, and took a servant's
   form,' so David celebrates the Lord, as the everlasting God and King,
   but sent to us and assuming our body which is mortal. For this is his
   meaning in the Psalm, All thy garments [2091] smell of myrrh, aloes,
   and cassia;' and it is represented by Nicodemus and by Mary's company,
   when the one came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an
   hundred pounds weight;' and the others [2092] the spices which they had
   prepared' for the burial of the Lord's body.

   48. What advancement then was it to the Immortal to have assumed the
   mortal? or what promotion is it to the Everlasting to have put on the
   temporal? what reward can be great to the Everlasting God and King in
   the bosom of the Father? See ye not, that this too was done and written
   because of us and for us, that us who are mortal and temporal, the
   Lord, become man, might make immortal, and bring into the everlasting
   kingdom of heaven? Blush ye not, speaking lies against the divine
   oracles? For when our Lord Jesus Christ had been among us, we indeed
   were promoted, as rescued from sin; but He is the same [2093] ; nor did
   He alter, when He became man (to repeat what I have said), but, as has
   been written, The Word of God abideth for ever [2094] .' Surely as,
   before His becoming man, He, the Word, dispensed to the saints the
   Spirit as His own [2095] , so also when made man, He sanctifies all by
   the Spirit and says to His Disciples, Receive ye the Holy Ghost.' And
   He gave to Moses and the other seventy; and through Him David prayed to
   the Father, saying, Take not Thy Holy Spirit from me [2096] .' On the
   other hand, when made man, He said, I will send to you the Paraclete,
   the Spirit of truth [2097] ;' and He sent Him, He, the Word of God, as
   being faithful. Therefore Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, to-day,
   and for ever [2098] ,' remaining unalterable, and at once gives and
   receives, giving as God's Word, receiving as man. It is not the Word
   then, viewed as the Word, that is promoted; for He had all things and
   has them always; but men, who have in Him and through Him their origin
   [2099] of receiving them. For, when He is now said to be anointed in a
   human respect, we it is who in Him are anointed; since also when He is
   baptized, we it is who in Him are baptized. But on all these things the
   Saviour throws much light, when He says to the Father, And the glory
   which Thou gavest Me, I have given to them, that they may be one, even
   as We are one [2100] .' Because of us then He asked for glory, and the
   words occur, took' and gave' and highly exalted,' that we might take,
   and to us might be given, and we might be exalted in Him; as also for
   us He sanctifies Himself, that we might be sanctified in Him [2101] .

   49. But if they take advantage of the word wherefore,' as connected
   with the passage in the Psalm, Wherefore God, even Thy God, hath
   anointed Thee,' for their own purposes, let these novices in Scripture
   and masters in irreligion know, that, as before, the word wherefore'
   does not imply reward of virtue or conduct in the Word, but the reason
   why He came down to us, and of the Spirit's anointing which took place
   in Him for our sakes. For He says not, Wherefore He anointed Thee in
   order to Thy being God or King or Son or Word;' for so He was before
   and is for ever, as has been shewn; but rather, Since Thou art God and
   King, therefore Thou wast anointed, since none but Thou couldest unite
   man to the Holy Ghost, Thou the Image of the Father, in which [2102] we
   were made in the beginning; for Thine is even the Spirit.' For the
   nature of things originate could give no warranty for this, Angels
   having transgressed, and men disobeyed [2103] . Wherefore there was
   need of God and the Word is God; that those who had become under a
   curse, He Himself might set free. If then He was of nothing, He would
   not have been the Christ or Anointed, being one among others and having
   fellowship as the rest [2104] . But, whereas He is God, as being Son of
   God, and is everlasting King, and exists as Radiance and Expression
   [2105] of the Father, therefore fitly is He the expected Christ, whom
   the Father announces to mankind, by revelation to His holy Prophets;
   that as through Him we have come to be, so also in Him all men might be
   redeemed from their sins, and by Him all things might be ruled [2106] .
   And this is the cause of the anointing which took place in Him, and of
   the incarnate presence of the Word [2107] , which the Psalmist
   foreseeing, celebrates, first His Godhead and kingdom, which is the
   Father's, in these tones, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a
   sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of Thy Kingdom [2108] ;' then
   announces His descent to us thus, Wherefore God, even Thy God, hath
   anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows [2109] .'

   50. What is there to wonder at, what to disbelieve, if the Lord who
   gives the Spirit, is here said Himself to be anointed with the Spirit,
   at a time when, necessity requiring it, He did not refuse in respect of
   His manhood to call Himself inferior to the Spirit? For the Jews saying
   that He cast out devils in Beelzebub, He answered and said to them, for
   the exposure of their blasphemy, But if I through the Spirit of God
   cast out demons [2110] .' Behold, the Giver of the Spirit here says
   that He cast out demons in the Spirit; but this is not said, except
   because of His flesh. For since man's nature is not equal of itself to
   casting out demons, but only in power of the Spirit, therefore as man
   He said, But if I through the Spirit of God cast out demons.' Of course
   too He signified that the blasphemy offered to the Holy Ghost is
   greater than that against His humanity, when He said, Whosoever shall
   speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him;' such as
   were those who said, Is not this the carpenter's son [2111] ?' but they
   who blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, and ascribe the deeds of the Word
   to the devil, shall have inevitable punishment [2112] . This is what
   the Lord spoke to the Jews, as man; but to the disciples shewing His
   Godhead and His majesty, and intimating that He was not inferior but
   equal to the Spirit, He gave the Spirit and said, Receive ye the Holy
   Ghost,' and I send Him,' and He shall glorify Me,' and Whatsoever He
   heareth, that He shall speak [2113] .' As then in this place the Lord
   Himself, the Giver of the Spirit, does not refuse to say that through
   the Spirit He casts out demons, as man; in like manner He the same, the
   Giver of the Spirit, refused not to say, The Spirit of the Lord is upon
   Me, because He hath anointed Me [2114] ,' in respect of His having
   become flesh, as John hath said; that it might be shewn in both these
   particulars, that we are they who need the Spirit's grace in our
   sanctification, and again who are unable to cast out demons without the
   Spirit's power. Through whom then and from whom behoved it that the
   Spirit should be given but through the Son, whose also the Spirit is?
   and when were we enabled to receive It, except when the Word became
   man? and, as the passage of the Apostle shews, that we had not been
   redeemed and highly exalted, had not He who exists in form of God taken
   a servant's form, so David also shews, that no otherwise should we have
   partaken the Spirit and been sanctified, but that the Giver of the
   Spirit, the Word Himself, hast spoken of Himself as anointed with the
   Spirit for us. And therefore have we securely received it, He being
   said to be anointed in the flesh; for the flesh being first sanctified
   in Him [2115] , and He being said, as man, to have received for its
   sake, we have the sequel of the Spirit grace, receiving out of His
   fulness [2116] .'

   51. Nor do the words, Thou hast loved righteousness and hated
   iniquity,' which are added in the Psalm, show, as again you suppose,
   that the Nature of the Word is alterable, but rather by their very
   force signify His unalterableness. For since of things originate the
   nature is alterable, and the one portion had transgressed and the other
   disobeyed, as has been said, and it is not certain how they will act,
   but it often happens that he who is now good afterwards alters and
   becomes different, so that one who was but now righteous, soon is found
   unrighteous, wherefore there was here also need of one unalterable,
   that men might have the immutability of the righteousness of the Word
   as an image and type for virtue [2117] . And this thought commends
   itself strongly to the right-minded. For since the first man Adam
   altered, and through sin death came into the world, therefore it became
   the second Adam to be unalterable; that, should the Serpent again
   assault, even the Serpent's deceit might be baffled, and, the Lord
   being unalterable and unchangeable, the Serpent might become powerless
   in his assault against all. For as when Adam had transgressed, his sin
   reached unto all men, so, when the Lord had become man and had
   overthrown the Serpent, that so great strength of His is to extend
   through all men, so that each of us may say, For we are not ignorant of
   his devices. [2118] ' Good reason then that the Lord, who ever is in
   nature unalterable, loving righteousness and hating iniquity, should be
   anointed and Himself sent, that, He, being and remaining the same
   [2119] , by taking this alterable flesh, might condemn sin in it [2120]
   ,' and might secure its freedom, and its ability [2121] henceforth to
   fulfil the righteousness of the law' in itself, so as to be able to
   say, But we are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if so be that the
   Spirit of God dwelleth in us [2122] .'

   52. Vainly then, here again, O Arians, have ye made this conjecture,
   and vainly alleged the words of Scripture; for God's Word is
   unalterable, and is ever in one state, not as it may happen [2123] ,
   but as the Father is; since how is He like the Father, unless He be
   thus? or how is all that is the Father's the Son's also, if He has not
   the unalterableness and unchangeableness of the Father [2124] ? Not as
   being subject to laws [2125] , and biassed to one side, does He love
   the one and hate the other, lest, if from fear of falling away He
   chooses the one, we admit that He is alterable otherwise also; but, as
   being God and the Father's Word, He is a just judge and lover of
   virtue, or rather its dispenser. Therefore being just and holy by
   nature, on this account He is said to love righteousness and to hate
   iniquity; as much as to say, that He loves and chooses the virtuous,
   and rejects and hates the unrighteous. And divine Scripture says the
   same of the Father; The Righteous Lord loveth righteousness; Thou
   hatest all them that work iniquity [2126] ,' and The Lord loveth the
   gates of Sion, more than all the dwellings of Jacob [2127] ;' and,
   Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated [2128] ;' and in Isaiah there
   is the voice of God again saying, I the Lord love righteousness, and
   hate robbery of unrighteousness [2129] .' Let them then expound those
   former words as these latter; for the former also are written of the
   Image of God: else, misinterpreting these as those, they will conceive
   that the Father too is alterable. But since the very hearing others say
   this is not without peril, we do well to think that God is said to love
   righteousness and to hate robbery of unrighteousness, not as if biassed
   to one side, and capable of the contrary, so as to select the latter
   and not choose the former, for this belongs to things originated, but
   that, as a judge, He loves and takes to Him the righteous and withdraws
   from the bad. It follows then to think the same concerning the Image of
   God also, that He loves and hates no otherwise than thus. For such must
   be the nature of the Image as is Its Father, though the Arians in their
   blindness fail to see either that image or any other truth of the
   divine oracles. For being forced from the conceptions or rather
   misconceptions [2130] of their own hearts, they fall back upon passages
   of divine Scripture, and here too from want of understanding, according
   to their wont, they discern not their meaning; but laying down their
   own irreligion as a sort of canon of interpretation [2131] , they wrest
   the whole of the divine oracles into accordance with it. And so on the
   bare mention of such doctrine, they deserve nothing but the reply, Ye
   do err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God [2132] ;' and
   if they persist in it, they must be put to silence, by the words,
   Render to' man the things that are' man's, and to God the things that
   are' God's [2133] .

   [2082] It is here said that all things originate' partake the Son and

   Son is necessary for every creature in order to its consistence, life,
   or preservation, has been explained, p. 162, note 3. Sometimes the Son

   [2090] Elsewhere Athan. says that our Lord's Godhead was the immediate
   anointing or chrism of the manhood He assumed, in Apollin. ii. 3, Orat.
   iv. Â§36. vid. Origen. Periarch. ii. 6. n. 4. And S. Greg. Naz. still
   more expressly, and from the same text as Athan. Orat. x. fin. Again,
   This [the Godhead] is the anointing of the manhood, not sanctifying by
   an energy as the other Christs [anointed] but by a presence of Him
   whole who anointed, holou tou chriontos; whence it came to pass that
   what anointed was called man and what was anointed was made God.' Orat.

   It is more common, however, to consider that the anointing was the
   descent of the Spirit, as Athan. says at the beginning of this section,
   according to Luke iv. 18; Acts x. 38.

   [2091] Ps. xlv. 8. Our Lord's manhood is spoken of as a garment; more
   distinctly afterwards, As Aaron was himself, and did not change on

   [2099] The word origin, arche, implies the doctrine, more fully brought
   out in other passages of the Fathers, that our Lord has deigned to
   become an instrumental cause, as it may be called, of the life of each
   individual Christian. For at first sight it may be objected to the
   whole course of Athan.'s argument thus;--What connection is there
   between the sanctification of Christ's manhood and ours? how does it
   prove that human nature is sanctified because a particular specimen of
   it was sanctified in Him? S. Chrysostom explains, Hom. in Matt. lxxxii.
   5. And just before, It sufficed not for Him to be made man, to be
   scourged, to be sacrificed; but He assimilates us to Him (anaphurei
   heauton hemin), nor merely by faith, but really, has He made us His
   body.' Again, That we are commingled (anakerasthomen) into that flesh,
   not merely through love, but really, is brought about by means of that
   food which He has bestowed upon us.' Hom. in Joann. 46. 3. And so S.
   Cyril writes against Nestorius: Since we have proved that Christ is the
   Vine, and we branches as adhering to a communion with Him, not
   spiritual merely but bodily, why clamours he against us thus
   bootlessly, saying that, since we adhere to Him, not in a bodily way,
   but rather by faith and the affection of love according to the Law,
   therefore He has called, not His own flesh the vine, but rather the
   Godhead?' in Joann. lib. 10. Cap. 2. pp. 863, 4. And Nyssen, Orat.
   Catech. 37. DecoctÃ¢ quasi per ollam carnis nostrÃ¦ cruditate,
   sanctificavit in Ã¦ternum nobis cibum carnem suam. Paulin. Ep. 23. Of
   course in such statements nothing material is implied; Hooker says, The
   mixture of His bodily substance with ours is a thing which the ancient
   Fathers disclaim. Yet the mixture of His flesh with ours they speak of,
   to signify what our very bodies through mystical conjunction receive
   from that vital efficacy which we know to be in His, and from bodily
   mixtures they borrow divers similitudes rather to declare the truth
   than the manner of coherence between His sacred and the sanctified
   bodies of saints.' Eccl. Pol. v. 56. Â§10. But without some explanation
   of this nature, language such as S. Athanasius's in the text seems a
   mere matter of words. vid. infr. Â§50 fin.

   Chapter XIII.--Texts Explained; Thirdly, Hebrews i. 4. Additional texts
   brought as objections; e.g. Heb. i. 4; vii. 22. Whether the word
   better' implies likeness to the Angels; and made' or become' implies
   creation. Necessary to consider the circumstances under which Scripture
   speaks. Difference between better' and greater;' texts in proof. Made'
   or become' a general word. Contrast in Heb. i. 4, between the Son and
   the Works in point of nature. The difference of the punishments under
   the two Covenants shews the difference of the natures of the Son and
   the Angels. Become' relates not to the nature of the Word, but to His
   manhood and office and relation towards us. Parallel passages in which
   the term is applied to the Eternal Father.

   53. But it is written, say they, in the Proverbs, The Lord created me
   the beginning of His ways, for His Works [2134] ;' and in the Epistle
   to the Hebrews the Apostle says, Being made so much better than the
   Angels, as He hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent Name than
   they [2135] .' And soon after, Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of
   the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our
   profession, Christ Jesus, who was faithful to Him that made Him [2136]
   .' And in the Acts, Therefore let all the house of Israel know
   assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified
   both Lord and Christ [2137] .' These passages they brought forward at
   every turn, mistaking their sense, under the idea that they proved that
   the Word of God was a creature and work and one of things originate;
   and thus they deceive the thoughtless, making the language of Scripture
   their pretence, but instead of the true sense sowing upon it the poison
   of their own heresy. For had they known, they would not have been
   irreligious against the Lord of glory [2138] ,' nor have wrested the
   good words of Scripture. If then henceforward openly adopting
   Caiaphas's way, they have determined on judaizing, and are ignorant of
   the text, that verily God shall dwell upon the earth [2139] , let them
   not inquire into the Apostolical sayings; for this is not the manner of
   Jews. But if, mixing themselves up with the godless Manichees [2140] ,
   they deny that the Word was made flesh,' and His Incarnate presence,
   then let them not bring forward the Proverbs, for this is out of place
   with the Manichees. But if for preferment-sake, and the lucre of
   avarice which follows [2141] , and the desire for good repute, they
   venture not on denying the text, The Word was made flesh,' since so it
   is written, either let them rightly interpret the words of Scripture,
   of the embodied presence of the Saviour, or, if they deny their sense,
   let them deny that the Lord became man at all. For it is unseemly,
   while confessing that the Word became flesh,' yet to be ashamed at what
   is written of Him, and on that account to corrupt the sense.

   54. For it is written, So much better than the Angels;' let us then
   first examine this. Now it is right and necessary, as in all divine
   Scripture, so here, faithfully to expound the time of which the Apostle
   wrote, and the person [2142] , and the point; lest the reader, from
   ignorance missing either these or any similar particular, may be wide
   of the true sense. This understood that inquiring eunuch, when he thus
   besought Philip, I pray thee, of whom doth the Prophet speak this? of
   himself, or of some other man [2143] ?' for he feared lest, expounding
   the lesson unsuitably to the person, he should wander from the right
   sense. And the disciples, wishing to learn the time of what was
   foretold, besought the Lord, Tell us,' said they, when shall these
   things be? and what is the sign of Thy coming [2144] ?' And again,
   hearing from the Saviour the events of the end, they desired to learn
   the time of it, that they might be kept from error themselves, and
   might be able to teach others; as, for instance, when they had learned,
   they set right the Thessalonians [2145] , who were going wrong. When
   then one knows properly these points, his understanding of the faith is
   right and healthy; but if he mistakes any such points, forthwith he
   falls into heresy. Thus HymenÃ¦us and Alexander and their fellows [2146]
   were beside the time, when they said that the resurrection had already
   been; and the Galatians were after the time, in making much of
   circumcision now. And to miss the person was the lot of the Jews, and
   is still, who think that of one of themselves is said, Behold, the
   Virgin shall conceive, and bear a Son, and they shall call his Name
   Emmanuel, which is being interpreted, God with us [2147] ;' and that, A
   prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you [2148] ,' is spoken of
   one of the Prophets; and who, as to the words, He was led as a sheep to
   the slaughter [2149] ,' instead of learning from Philip, conjecture
   them spoken of Isaiah or some other of the former Prophets [2150] .

   55. (3.) Such has been the state of mind under which Christ's enemies
   have fallen into their execrable heresy. For had they known the person,
   and the subject, and the season of the Apostle's words, they would not
   have expounded of Christ's divinity what belongs to His manhood, nor in
   their folly have committed so great an act of irreligion. Now this will
   be readily seen, if one expounds properly the beginning of this
   lection. For the Apostle says, God who at sundry times and divers
   manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in
   these last days spoken unto us by His Son [2151] ;' then again shortly
   after he says, when He had by Himself purged our sins, He sat down on
   the right hand of the Majesty on high, having become so much better
   than the Angels, as He hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent
   Name than they [2152] .' It appears then that the Apostle's words make
   mention of that time, when God spoke unto us by His Son, and when a
   purging of sins took place. Now when did He speak unto us by His Son,
   and when did purging of sins take place? and when did He become man?
   when, but subsequently to the Prophets in the last days? Next,
   proceeding with his account of the economy in which we were concerned,
   and speaking of the last times, he is naturally led to observe that not
   even in the former times was God silent with men, but spoke to them by
   the Prophets. And, whereas the prophets ministered, and the Law was
   spoken by Angels, while the Son too came on earth, and that in order to
   minister, he was forced to add, Become so much better than the Angels,'
   wishing to shew that, as much as the son excels a servant, so much also
   the ministry of the Son is better than the ministry of servants.
   Contrasting then the old ministry and the new, the Apostle deals freely
   with the Jews, writing and saying, Become so much better than the
   Angels.' This is why throughout he uses no comparison, such as become
   greater,' or more honourable,' lest we should think of Him and them as
   one in kind, but better' is his word, by way of marking the difference
   of the Son's nature from things originated. And of this we have proof
   from divine Scripture; David, for instance, saying in the Psalm, One
   day in Thy courts is better than a thousand [2153] :' and Solomon
   crying out, Receive my instruction and not silver, and knowledge rather
   than choice gold. For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things
   that may be desired are not to be compared to it [2154] .' Are not
   wisdom and stones of the earth different in essence and separate in
   nature? Are heavenly courts at all akin to earthly houses? Or is there
   any similarity between things eternal and spiritual, and things
   temporal and mortal? And this is what Isaiah says, Thus saith the Lord
   unto the eunuchs that keep My sabbaths, and choose the things that
   please Me, and take hold of My Covenant; even unto them will I give in
   Mine house, and within My walls, a place and a name better than of sons
   and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name that shall not
   be cut off [2155] .' In like manner there is nought akin between the
   Son and the Angels; so that the word better' is not used to compare but
   to contrast, because of the difference of His nature from them. And
   therefore the Apostle also himself, when he interprets the word
   better,' places its force in nothing short of the Son's excellence over
   things originated, calling the one Son, the other servants; the one, as
   a Son with the Father, sitting on the right; and the others, as
   servants, standing before Him, and being sent, and fulfilling offices.

   56. Scripture, in speaking thus, implies, O Arians, not that the Son is
   originate, but rather other than things originate, and proper to the
   Father, being in His bosom. (4.) Nor [2156] does even the expression
   become,' which here occurs, shew that the Son is originate, as ye
   suppose. If indeed it were simply become' and no more, a case might
   stand for the Arians; but, whereas they are forestalled with the word
   Son' throughout the passage, shewing that He is other than things
   originate, so again not even the word become' occurs absolutely [2157]
   , but better' is immediately subjoined. For the writer thought the
   expression immaterial, knowing that in the case of one who was
   confessedly a genuine Son, to say become' is the same with saying that
   He had been made, and is, better.' For it matters not even if we speak
   of what is generate, as become' or made;' but on the contrary, things
   originate cannot be called generate, God's handiwork as they are,
   except so far as after their making they partake of the generate Son,
   and are therefore said to have been generated also, not at all in their
   own nature, but because of their participation of the Son in the Spirit
   [2158] . And this again divine Scripture recognises; for it says in the
   case of things originate, All things came to be through Him, and
   without Him nothing came to be [2159] ,' and, In wisdom hast Thou made
   them all [2160] ;' but in the case of sons which are generate, To Job
   there came to be seven sons and three daughters [2161] ,' and, Abraham
   was an hundred years old when there came to be to him Isaac his son
   [2162] ;' and Moses said [2163] , If to any one there come to be sons.'
   Therefore since the Son is other than things originate, alone the
   proper offspring of the Father's essence, this plea of the Arians about
   the word become' is worth nothing.

   (5.) If moreover, baffled so far, they should still violently insist
   that the language is that of comparison, and that comparison in
   consequence implies oneness of kind, so that the Son is of the nature
   of Angels, they will in the first place incur the disgrace of rivalling
   and repeating what Valentinus held, and Carpocrates, and those other
   heretics, of whom the former said that the Angels were one in kind with
   the Christ, and Carpocrates that Angels are framers of the world [2164]
   . Perchance it is under the instruction of these masters that they
   compare the Word of God with the Angels.

   57. Though surely amid such speculations, they will be moved by the
   sacred poet, saying, Who is he among the gods that shall be like unto
   the Lord [2165] ,' and, Among the gods there is none like unto Thee, O
   Lord [2166] .' However, they must be answered, with the chance of their
   profiting by it, that comparison confessedly does belong to subjects
   one in kind, not to those which differ. No one, for instance, would
   compare God with man, or again man with brutes, nor wood with stone,
   because their natures are unlike; but God is beyond comparison, and man
   is compared to man, and wood to wood, and stone to stone. Now in such
   cases we should not speak of better,' but of rather' and more;' thus
   Joseph was comely rather than his brethren, and Rachel than Leah; star
   [2167] is not better than star, but is the rather excellent in glory;
   whereas in bringing together things which differ in kind, then better'
   is used to mark the difference, as has been said in the case of wisdom
   and jewels. Had then the Apostle said, by so much has the Son
   precedence of the Angels,' or by so much greater,' you would have had a
   plea, as if the Son were compared with the Angels; but, as it is, in
   saying that He is better,' and differs as far as Son from servants, the
   Apostle shews that He is other than the Angels in nature.

   (6.) Moreover by saying that He it is who has laid the foundation of
   all things [2168] ,' he shews that He is other than all things
   originate. But if He be other and different in essence from their
   nature, what comparison of His essence can [2169] there be, or what
   likeness to them? though, even if they have any such thoughts, Paul
   shall refute them, who speaks to the very point, For unto which of the
   Angels said He at any time, Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten
   Thee? And of the Angels He saith, Who maketh His Angels spirits, and
   His ministers a flame of fire [2170] .'

   58. Observe here, the word made' belongs to things originate, and he
   calls them things made; but to the Son he speaks not of making, nor of
   becoming, but of eternity and kingship, and a Framer's office,
   exclaiming, Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever;' and, Thou, Lord,
   in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens
   are the works of Thine hands; they shall perish, but Thou remainest.'
   From which words even they, were they but willing, might perceive that
   the Framer is other than things framed, the former God, the latter
   things originate, made out of nothing. For what has been said, They
   shall perish,' is said, not as if the creation were destined for
   destruction, but to express the nature of things originate by the issue
   to which they tend [2171] . For things which admit of perishing, though
   through the grace [2172] of their Maker they perish not, yet have come
   out of nothing, and themselves witness that they once were not. And on
   this account, since their nature is such, it is said of the Son, Thou
   remainest,' to shew His eternity; for not having the capacity of
   perishing, as things originate have, but having eternal duration, it is
   foreign to Him to have it said, He was not before His generation,' but
   proper to Him to be always, and to endure together with the Father. And
   though the Apostle had not thus written in his Epistle to the Hebrews,
   still his other Epistles, and the whole of Scripture, would certainly
   forbid their entertaining such notions concerning the Word. But since
   he has here expressly written it, and, as has been above shewn, the Son
   is Offspring of the Father's essence, and He is Framer, and other
   things are framed by Him, and He is the Radiance and Word and Image and
   Wisdom of the Father, and things originate stand and serve in their
   place below the Triad, therefore the Son is different in kind and
   different in essence from things originate, and on the contrary is
   proper to the Father's essence and one in nature with it [2173] . And
   hence it is that the Son too says not, My Father is better than I
   [2174] ,' lest we should conceive Him to be foreign to His Nature, but
   greater,' not indeed in greatness, nor in time, but because of His
   generation from the Father Himself [2175] , nay, in saying greater' He
   again shows that He is proper to His essence.

   59. (7). And the Apostle's own reason for saying, so much better than
   the Angels,' was not any wish in the first instance to compare the
   essence [2176] of the Word to things originate (for He cannot be
   compared, rather they are incommeasurable), but regarding the Word's
   visitation in the flesh, and the Economy which He then sustained, he
   wished to show that He was not like those who had gone before Him; so
   that, as much as He excelled in nature those who were sent afore by
   Him, by so much also the grace which came from and through Him was
   better than the ministry through Angels [2177] . For it is the function
   of servants, to demand the fruits and no more; but of the Son and
   Master to forgive the debts and to transfer the vineyard.

   (8.) Certainly what the Apostle proceeds to say shews the excellence of
   the Son over things originate; Therefore we ought to give the more
   earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we
   should let them slip. For if the word spoken by Angels was stedfast,
   and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of
   reward; how shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at
   the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by
   them that heard Him [2178] .' But if the Son were in the number of
   things originate, He was not better than they, nor did disobedience
   involve increase of punishment because of Him; any more than in the
   Ministry of Angels there was not, according to each Angel, greater or
   less guilt in the transgressors, but the Law was one, and one was its
   vengeance on transgressors. But, whereas the Word is not in the number
   of originate things, but is Son of the Father, therefore, as He Himself
   is better and His acts better and transcendent, so also the punishment
   is worse. Let them contemplate then the grace which is through the Son,
   and let them acknowledge the witness which He gives even from His
   works, that He is other than things originated, and alone the very Son
   in the Father and the Father in Him. And the Law [2179] was spoken by
   Angels, and perfected no one [2180] , needing the visitation of the
   Word, as Paul hath said; but that visitation has perfected the work of
   the Father. And then, from Adam unto Moses death reigned [2181] ; but
   the presence of the Word abolished death [2182] . And no longer in Adam
   are we all dying [2183] ; but in Christ we are all reviving. And then,
   from Dan to Beersheba was the Law proclaimed, and in JudÃ¦a only was God
   known; but now, unto all the earth has gone forth their voice, and all
   the earth has been filled with the knowledge of God [2184] , and the
   disciples have made disciples of all the nations [2185] , and now is
   fulfilled what is written, They shall be all taught of God [2186] .'
   And then what was revealed was but a type; but now the truth has been
   manifested. And this again the Apostle himself describes afterwards
   more clearly, saying, By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better
   testament;' and again, But now hath He obtained a more excellent
   ministry, by how much also He is the Mediator of a better covenant,
   which was established upon better promises.' And, For the Law made
   nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did.' And again
   he says, It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the
   heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things
   themselves with better sacrifices than these [2187] .' Both in the
   verse before us, then, and throughout, does he ascribe the word better'
   to the Lord, who is better and other than originated things. For better
   is the sacrifice through Him, better the hope in Him; and also the
   promises through Him, not merely as great compared with small, but the
   one differing from the other in nature, because He who conducts this
   economy, is better' than things originated.

   60. (9.) Moreover the words He is become surety' denote the pledge in
   our behalf which He has provided. For as, being the Word,' He became
   flesh [2188] ' and become' we ascribe to the flesh, for it is
   originated and created, so do we here the expression He is become,'
   expounding it according to a second sense, viz. because He has become
   man. And let these contentious men know, that they fail in this their
   perverse purpose; let them know that Paul does not signify that His
   essence [2189] has become, knowing, as he did, that He is Son and
   Wisdom and Radiance and Image of the Father; but here too he refers the
   word become' to the ministry of that covenant, in which death which
   once ruled is abolished. Since here also the ministry through Him has
   become better, in that what the Law could not do in that it was weak
   through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful
   flesh, and for sin condemned sin in the flesh [2190] ,' ridding it of
   the trespass, in which, being continually held captive, it admitted not
   the Divine mind. And having rendered the flesh capable of the Word, He
   made us walk, no longer according to the flesh, but according to the
   Spirit, and say again and again, But we are not in the flesh but in the
   Spirit,' and, For the Son of God came into the world, not to judge the
   world, but to redeem all men, and that the world might be saved through
   Him [2191] .' Formerly the world, as guilty, was under judgment from
   the Law; but now the Word has taken on Himself the judgment, and having
   suffered in the body for all, has bestowed salvation to all [2192] .
   With a view to this has John exclaimed, The law was given by Moses, but
   grace and truth came by Jesus Christ [2193] .' Better is grace than the
   Law, and truth than the shadow.

   61. (10.) Better' then, as has been said, could not have been brought
   to pass by any other than the Son, who sits on the right hand of the
   Father. And what does this denote but the Son's genuineness, and that
   the Godhead of the Father is the same as the Son's [2194] ? For in that
   the Son reigns in His Father's kingdom, is seated upon the same throne
   as the Father, and is contemplated in the Father's Godhead, therefore
   is the Word God, and whoso beholds the Son, beholds the Father; and
   thus there is one God. Sitting then on the right, yet He does not place
   His Father on the left [2195] ; but whatever is right [2196] and
   precious in the Father, that also the Son has, and says, All things
   that the Father hath are Mine [2197] .' Wherefore also the Son, though
   sitting on the right, also sees the Father on the right, though it be
   as become man that He says, I saw the Lord always before My face, for
   He is on My right hand, therefore I shall not fall [2198] .' This shews
   moreover that the Son is in the Father and the Father in the Son; for
   the Father being on the right, the Son is on the right; and while the
   Son sits on the right of the Father, the Father is in the Son. And the
   Angels indeed minister ascending and descending; but concerning the Son
   he saith, And let all the Angels of God worship Him [2199] .' And when
   Angels minister, they say, I am sent unto thee,' and, The Lord has
   commanded;' but the Son, though He say in human fashion, I am sent
   [2200] ,' and comes to finish the work and to minister, nevertheless
   says, as being Word and Image, I am in the Father, and the Father in
   Me;' and, He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father;' and, The Father
   that abideth in Me, He doeth the works [2201] ;' for what we behold in
   that Image are the Father's works.

   (11.) What has been already said ought to shame those persons who are
   fighting against the very truth; however, if, because it is written,
   become better,' they refuse to understand become,' as used of the Son,
   as has been and is [2202] ;' or again as referring to the better
   covenant having come to be [2203] , as we have said, but consider from
   this expression that the Word is called originate, let them hear the
   same again in a concise form, since they have forgotten what has been
   said.

   62. If the Son be in the number of the Angels, then let the word
   become' apply to Him as to them, and let Him not differ at all from
   them in nature; but be they either sons with Him, or be He an Angel
   with them; sit they one and all together on the right hand of the
   Father, or be the Son standing with them all as a ministering Spirit,
   sent forth to minister Himself as they are. But if on the other hand
   Paul distinguishes the Son from things originate, saying, To which of
   the Angels said He at any time, Thou art My Son?' and the one frames
   heaven and earth, but they are made by Him; and He sitteth with the
   Father, but they stand by ministering, who does not see that he has not
   used the word become' of the essence of the Word, but of the
   ministration come through Him? For as, being the Word,' He became
   flesh,' so when become man, He became by so much better in His
   ministry, than the ministry which came by the Angels, as Son excels
   servants and Framer things framed. Let them cease therefore to take the
   word become' of the substance of the Son, for He is not one of
   originated things; and let them acknowledge that it is indicative of
   His ministry and the Economy which came to pass.

   (12.) But how He became better in His ministry, being better in nature
   than things originate, appears from what has been said before, which, I
   consider, is sufficient in itself to put them to shame. But if they
   carry on the contest, it will be proper upon their rash daring to close
   with them, and to oppose to them those similar expressions which are
   used concerning the Father Himself. This may serve to shame them to
   refrain their tongue from evil, or may teach them the depth of their
   folly. Now it is written, Become my strong rock and house of defence,
   that Thou mayest save me [2204] .' And again, The Lord became a defence
   for the oppressed [2205] ,' and the like which are found in divine
   Scripture. If then they apply these passages to the Son, which perhaps
   is nearest to the truth, then let them acknowledge that the sacred
   writers ask Him, as not being originate, to become to them a strong
   rock and house of defence;' and for the future let them understand
   become,' and He made,' and He created,' of His incarnate presence. For
   then did He become a strong rock and house of defence,' when He bore
   our sins in His own body upon the tree, and said, Come unto Me, all ye
   that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest [2206] .'

   63. But if they refer these passages to the Father, will they, when it
   is here also written, Become' and He became,' venture so far as to
   affirm that God is originate? Yea, they will dare, as they thus argue
   concerning His Word; for the course of their argument carries them on
   to conjecture the same things concerning the Father, as they devise
   concerning His Word. But far be such a notion ever from the thoughts of
   all the faithful! for neither is the Son in the number of things
   originated, nor do the words of Scripture in question, Become,' and He
   became,' denote beginning of being, but that succour which was given to
   the needy. For God is always, and one and the same; but men have come
   to be afterwards through the Word, when the Father Himself willed it;
   and God is invisible and inaccessible to originated things, and
   especially to men upon earth. When then men in infirmity invoke Him,
   when in persecution they ask help, when under injuries they pray, then
   the Invisible, being a lover of man, shines forth upon them with His
   beneficence, which He exercises through and in His proper Word. And
   forthwith the divine manifestation is made to every one according to
   his need, and is made to the weak health, and to the persecuted a
   refuge' and house of defence;' and to the injured He says, While thou
   speakest I will say, Here I am [2207] .' Whatever defence then comes to
   each through the Son, that each says that God has come to be to
   himself, since succour comes from God Himself through the Word.
   Moreover the usage of men recognises this, and every one will confess
   its propriety. Often succour comes from man to man; one has undertaken
   toil for the injured, as Abraham for Lot; and another has opened his
   home to the persecuted, as Obadiah to the sons of the prophets; and
   another has entertained a stranger, as Lot the Angels; and another has
   supplied the needy, as Job those who begged of him. And then, should
   one and the other of these benefited persons say, Such a one became an
   assistance to me,' and another and to me a refuge,' and to another a
   supply,' yet in so saying would not be speaking of the original
   becoming or of the essence of their benefactors, but of the beneficence
   coming to themselves from them; so also when the saints say concerning
   God, He became' and become Thou,' they do not denote any original
   becoming, for God is without beginning and unoriginate, but the
   salvation which is made to be unto men from Him.

   64. This being so understood, it is parallel also respecting the Son,
   that whatever, and however often, is said, such as, He became' and
   become,' should ever have the same sense: so that as, when we hear the
   words in question, become better than the Angels' and He became,' we
   should not conceive any original becoming of the Word, nor in any way
   fancy from such terms that He is originate; but should understand
   Paul's words of His ministry and Economy when He became man. For when
   the Word became flesh and dwelt among us [2208] ' and came to minister
   and to grant salvation to all, then He became to us salvation, and
   became life, and became propitiation; then His economy in our behalf
   became much better than the Angels, and He became the Way and became
   the Resurrection. And as the words Become my strong rock' do not denote
   that the essence of God Himself became, but His lovingkindness, as has
   been said, so also here the having become better than the Angels,' and,
   He became,' and, by so much is Jesus become a better surety,' do not
   signify that the essence of the Word is originate (perish the
   thought!), but the beneficence which towards us came to be through His
   becoming Man; unthankful though the heretics be, and obstinate in
   behalf of their irreligion.

   Excursus B. On Â§22 (Note 3).

   On the Meaning of the Formula prin gennethenai ouk en, in the Nicene
   Anathema.

   It was observed on p. 75, note 4(b), that there were two clauses in the
   Nicene Anathema which required explanation. One of them, ex heteras
   hupostaseos e ousias, has been discussed in the Excursus, pp. 77-82;
   the other, prin gennethenai ouk en, shall be considered now.

   Bishop Bull has suggested a very ingenious interpretation of it, which
   is not obvious, but which, when stated, has much plausibility, as going
   to explain, or rather to sanction, certain modes of speech in some
   early Fathers of venerable authority, which have been urged by
   heterodox writers, and given up by Catholics of the Roman School, as
   savouring of Arianism. The foregoing pages have made it abundantly
   evident that the point of controversy between Catholics and Arians was,
   not whether our Lord was God, but whether He was Son of God; the
   solution of the former question being involved in that of the latter.
   The Arians maintained that the very word Son' implied a beginning,' or
   that our Lord was not Very God; the Catholics said that it implied
   connaturality,' or that He was Very God as one with God. Now five early
   writers, Athenagoras, Tatian, Theophilus, Hippolytus, and Novatian, of
   whom the authority of Hippolytus is very great, not to speak of
   Theophilus and Athenagoras, whatever be thought of Tatian and of
   Novatian, seem to speak of the divine generation as taking place
   immediately before the creation of the world, that is, as if not
   eternal, though at the same time they teach that our Lord existed
   before that generation. In other words they seem to teach that He was
   the Word from eternity, and became the Son at the beginning of all
   things; some of them expressly considering Him, first as the logos
   endiathetos, or Reason, in the Father, or (as may be speciously
   represented) a mere attribute; next, as the logos prophorikos, or Word,
   terms which are explained, note on de Syn. 26 (5). This doctrine, when
   divested of figure and put into literal statement, might appear nothing
   more or less than this,--that at the beginning of the world the Son was
   created after the likeness of the Divine attribute of Reason, as its
   image or expression, and thereby became the Divine Word, was made the
   instrument of creation, called the Son from that ineffable favour and
   adoption which God had bestowed on Him, and in due time sent into the
   world to manifest God's perfections to mankind;--which, it is scarcely
   necessary to say, is the doctrine of Arianism.

   Thus S. Hippolytus says,--

   Ton de ginomenon archegon kai sumboulon kai ergaten egenna logon, hon
   logon echon en heauto a& 231;raton te onta to ktizomeno, kosmo, horaton
   poiei; proteran phonen phthengomenos, kai phos ek photos gennon,
   proeken te ktisei kurion. contr. Noet. 10.

   And S. Theophilus:--

   Echon oun ho theos ton heautou logon endiatheton en tois idiois
   splanchnois, egennesen auton meta tes heautou sophias exereuxamenos pro
   ton holon...hopote de ethelesen ho theos poiesai hosa ebouleusato,
   touton ton logon egennese prophorikon, prototokon pases ktiseos. ad
   Autol. ii. 10-22.

   Bishop Bull, Defens. F. N. iii. 5-8, meets this representation by
   maintaining that the gennesis which S. Hippolytus and other writers
   spoke of, was but a metaphorical generation, the real and eternal truth
   being shadowed out by a succession of events in the economy of time,
   such as is the Resurrection (Acts xiii. 33), nay, the Nativity; and
   that of these His going forth to create the worlds was one. And he
   maintains (ibid. iii. 9) that such is the mode of speaking adopted by
   the Fathers after the Nicene Council as well as before. And then he
   adds (which is our present point), that it is even alluded to and
   recognised in the Creed of the Council, which anathematizes those who
   say that the Son was not before His generation,' i.e. who deny that the
   Son was before His generation,' which statement accordingly becomes
   indirectly a Catholic truth.

   I am not aware whether any writer has preceded or followed this great
   authority in this view [2209] . The more obvious mode of understanding
   the Arian formula is this, that it is an argument ex absurdo, drawn
   from the force of the word Son, in behalf of the Arian doctrine; it
   being, as they would say, a truism, that, whereas He was begotten, He
   was not before He was begotten,' and the denial of it a contradiction
   in terms. This certainly does seem to myself the true force of the
   formula; so much so, that if Bishop Bull's explanation be admissible,
   it must, in order to its being so, first be shewn to be reducible to
   this sense, and to be included under it.

   The point at issue between the two interpretations is this; whether the
   clause prin gennethenai ouk en is intended for a denial of the contrary
   proposition, He was before His generation,' as Bishop Bull says; or
   whether it is what Aristotle calls an enthymematic sentence, assuming
   the falsity, as confessed on all hands, of that contrary proposition,
   as self-contradictory, and directly denying, not it, but He was from
   everlasting.' Or, in other words, whether it opposes the position of
   the five writers, or the great Catholic doctrine itself; and whether in
   consequence the Nicene Fathers are in their anathema indirectly
   sanctioning that position, or stating that doctrine. Bull considers
   that both sides contemplated the proposition, He was before His
   generation,'--and that the Catholics asserted or defended it; some
   reasons shall here be given for the contrary view.

   1. Now first, let me repeat, what was just now observed by the way,
   that the formula in question, when taken as an enthymematic sentence,
   or reductio ad absurdum, exactly expresses the main argument of the
   Arians, which they brought forward in so many shapes, as feeling that
   their cause turned upon it, He is a son, therefore He had a beginning.'
   Thus Socrates records Arius's words in the beginning of the
   controversy, (1) If the Father begat the Son, He who is begotten has a
   beginning of existence; (2) therefore once the Son was not, en hote ouk
   en; (3) therefore He has His subsistence from nothing, ex ouk onton
   echei ten hupostasin.' H. E. i. 5. The first of these propositions
   exactly answers to the ouk en prin gennethenai taken enthymematically;
   and it may be added that when so taken, the three propositions will
   just answer to the three first formulÃ¦ anathematized at NicÃ¦a, two of
   which are indisputably the same as two of them; viz. hoti en pote dte
   ouk en; & 234;ti prin gennethenai ouk en; & 234;ti ex ouk onton
   egeneto. On the other hand, we hear nothing in the controversy of the
   position which Bull conceives to be opposed by Arius (He was before His
   generation'), that is, supposing the formula in question does not
   allude to it; unless indeed it is worth while to except the statement
   reprobated in the Letter of the Arians to Alexander, onta proteron,
   gennethenta eis hui& 231;n, which is explained, de Syn. 16. note 12.

   2. Next, it should be observed that the other formulÃ¦ here, as
   elsewhere, mentioned, are enthymematic also, or carry their argument
   with them, and that, an argument resolvable often into the original
   argument derived from the word Son.' Such are ho on ton me onta ek tou
   ontos e ton onta; and hen to ageneton e duo; and in like manner as
   regards the question of the trepton; Has He free will' (thus Athanasius
   states the Arian objection) or has He not? is He good from choice
   according to free will, and can He, if He will, alter, being of an
   alterable nature? as wood or stone, has He not His choice free to be
   moved, and incline hither and thither?' supr. Â§35. That is, they wished
   the word treptos to carry with it its own self-evident application to
   our Lord, with the alternative of an absurdity; and so to prove His
   created nature.

   3. In Â§32, S. Athanasius observes that the formula of the ageneton was
   the later substitute for the original formulÃ¦ of Arius; when they were
   no longer allowed to say, "out of nothing," and "He was not before His
   generation,"' they hit upon this word Unoriginate, that, by saying
   among the simple that the Son was originate, they might imply the very
   same phrases "out of nothing" and "He once was not." Here he does not
   in so many words say that the argument from the ageneton was a
   substitute for the ouk en prin gennethenai, yet surely it is not unfair
   so to understand him. But it is plain that the ageneton was brought
   forward merely to express by an appeal to philosophy and earlier
   Fathers, that to be a Son was to have a beginning and a creation, and
   not to be God. This therefore will be the sense of the ouk en prin
   gennethenai. Nay, when the Arians asked, Is the ageneton one or two,'
   they actually did assume that it was granted by their opponents that
   the Father only was agenetos; which it was not, if the latter held,
   nay, if they had sanctioned at NicÃ¦a, as Bull says, that our Lord en
   prin gennethe; and moreover which they knew and confessed was not
   granted, if their own formula ouk en prin gennethenai was directed
   against this statement.

   4. Again, it is plain that the ouk en prin gennethenai is used by S.
   Athanasius as the same objection with ho on ton me onta ek tou ontos,
   &c. E.g. he says, We might ask them in turn, God who is, has He so
   become, whereas He was not?' or is He also before His generation?
   whereas He is, did He make Himself, or is He of nothing. &c., Â§25. Now
   the ho on ton me onta, &c., is evidently an argument, and that,
   grounded on the absurdity of saying ho on ton onta. S. Alexander's
   Encyclical Letter (vid. Socr. i. 6), compared with Arius's original
   positions and the Nicene Anathemas as referred to above, is a strong
   confirmation. In these three documents the formulÃ¦ agree together,
   except one; and that one, which in Arius's language is he who is
   begotten has a beginning of existence,' is in the Nicene Anathema, ouk
   en prin gennethenai, but in S. Alexander's circular, ho on theos ton me
   onta ek tou me ontos pepoieken. The absence of the ouk en prin, &c., in
   S. Alexander is certainly remarkable. Moreover the two formulÃ¦ are
   treated as synonymous by Greg. Naz. Orat. 29. 9. Cyril, Thesaur. 4. p.
   29 fin., and by Basil as quoted below. But indeed there is an internal
   correspondence between them, shewing that they have but one meaning.
   They are really but the same sentence in the active and in the passive
   voice.

   5. A number of scattered passages in Athanasius lead us to the same
   conclusion. For instance, if the Arian formula had the sense which is
   here maintained, of being an argument against our Lord's eternity, the
   Catholic answer would be, He could not be before His generation because
   His generation is eternal, as being from the Father.' Now this is
   precisely the language Athanasius uses, when it occurs to him to
   introduce the words in question. Thus in Orat. ii. Â§57 he says, The
   creatures began to come to be (ginesthai); but the Word of God, not
   having beginning (archen) of being, surely did not begin to be, nor
   begin to come to be, but was always. And the works have a beginning
   (archen) in the making, and the beginning precedes things which come to
   be; but the Word not being of such, rather Himself becomes the Framer
   of those things which have a beginning. And the being of things
   originate is measured by their becoming (en to ginesthai), and at some
   beginning (origin) doth God begin to make them through the Word, that
   it may be known that they were not before their origination (prin
   genesthai); but the Word hath His being in no other origin than the
   Father (vid. supr. Â§11, note 1), whom they themselves allow to be
   unoriginate, so that He too exists unoriginately in the Father, being
   His offspring not His creature.' We shall find that other Fathers say
   just the same. Again, we have already come to a passage where for His
   generation,' he substitutes making,' a word which Bull would not say
   that either the Nicene Council or S. Hippolytus would use; clearly
   shewing that the Arians were not quoting and denying a Catholic
   statement in the ouk en prin, &c., but laying down one of their own.
   Who is there in all mankind, Greek or Barbarian, who ventures to rank
   among creatures One whom he confesses the while to be God, and says
   that "He was not before He was made,' prin poiethe."' Orat. i. Â§10.
   Arius, who is surely the best explainer of his own words, says the
   same; that is, he interprets generation' by making,' or confesses that
   he is bringing forward an argument, not opposing a dogma; Before His
   generation,' he says, or creation, or destination (horisthe), Rom. i.
   4), or founding (vid. Prov. viii. 23), He was not; for He was not
   ingenerate.' Theod., Hist. i. 4. Eusebius of Nicomedia also, in a
   passage which has already come before us, says distinctly, "It is plain
   to any one," that what has been made was not before its generation; but
   what came to be has an origin of being.' De Syn. Â§17.

   6. If there are passages in Athanasius which seem to favour the
   opposite interpretation, that is, to imply that the Catholics held or
   allowed, as Bp. Bull considers, that before His generation, He was,'
   they admit of an explanation. E.g. "How is He not in the number of the
   creatures, if, as they say, He was not before His generation? for it is
   proper to the creatures and works, not to be before their generation.'
   Orat. ii. Â§22. This might be taken to imply that the Arians said, He
   was not,' and Catholics He was.' But the real meaning is this, How is
   He not a creature, if the formula be true, which they use, "He was not
   before His generation?" for it may indeed properly be said of creatures
   that "they were not before their generation."' And so again when he
   says, if the Son was not before His generation, Truth was not always in
   God,' supr. Â§20, he does not thereby imply that the Son was before His
   generation, but he means, if it be true that, &c.,' if the formula
   holds,' if it can be said of the Son, "He was not, &c."' Accordingly,
   shortly afterwards, in a passage already cited, he says the same of the
   Almighty Father in the way of parallel; God who is, hath He so become,
   whereas He was not, or "is He too before His generation?"' (Â§25), not
   implying here any generation at all, but urging that the question is
   idle and irrelevant, that the formula is unmeaning and does not apply
   to, cannot be said of, Father or Son.

   7. Such an explanation of these passages, as well as the view here
   taken of the formula itself, receive abundant confirmation from S.
   Gregory Nazianzen and S. Hilary. What has been maintained is, that when
   S. Athanasius says, if the Son is not before His generation, then,
   &c.,' he does but mean, if it can be said,' if the words can be used or
   applied in this case.' Now the two Fathers just mentioned both decide
   that it is not true, either that the Son was before His generation, or
   that He was not; in other words, that the question is unmeaning and
   irrelevant, which is just the interpretation which has been here given
   to Athanasius. But again, in thus speaking, they thereby assert also
   that they did not hold, that they do not allow, that formula which Bull
   considers the Nicene Fathers defended and sanctioned, as being Catholic
   and in use both before the Council and after, viz. He was before His
   generation.' Thus S. Gregory in the passage in which he speaks of did
   He that is make Him that is not, &c.,' and before His generation, &c.,'
   as one and the same, expressly says, In His case, to be begotten is
   concurrent with existence and is from the beginning,' and that in
   contrast to the instance of men; who he says, do fulfil in a manner He
   who is, &c.' (Levi being in the loins of Abraham), i.e. fulfil Bull's
   proposition, He was before generation.' He proceeds, I say that the
   question is irrelevant, not the answer difficult.' And presently after,
   mentioning some idle inquiries by way of parallel, he adds, more
   ill-instructed, be sure, is it to decide whether what was generated
   from the beginning was or was not before generation, pro tes
   genneseos.' Orat. 29. 9.

   8. S. Hilary, on the other hand, is so full on the subject in his de
   Trin. xii., and so entirely to the point for which I would adduce him,
   that but a few extracts of what might be made are either necessary or
   practicable. He states and argues on the formula expressly as an
   objection; Adjiciant hÃ¦c arguta satis atque auditu placentia; Si,
   inquit, natus est, coepit; et cum coepit, non fuit; et cum non fuit,
   non patitur ut fuerit. Atque idcirco piÃ¦ intelligentiÃ¦, sermonem esse
   contendant, Non fuit ante quam nasceretur, quia ut esset, qui non erat,
   natus est.' n. 18. He answers the objection in the same way. Unigenitus
   Deus neque non fuit aliquando non filius, neque fuit aliquid ante quam
   filius, neque quidquam aliquid ipse nisi filius,' n. 15, which is in
   express words to deny, He was before His generation.' Again, as
   Gregory, Ubi pater auctor est, ibi et nativitas est; et vero ubi auctor
   Ã¦ternus est, ibi et nativitatis Ã¦ternitas est,' n. 21. And he
   substitutes being always born' for being before birth;' Numquid ante
   tempora Ã¦terna esse, id ipsum sit quod est, eum qui erat nasci? quia
   nasci quod erat, jam non nasci est, sed se ipsum demutare
   nascendo....Non est itaque id ipsum, natum ante tempora Ã¦terna semper
   esse, et esse antequam nasci.' n. 30. And he concludes, in accordance
   with the above explanation of the passages of Athanasius which I
   brought as if objections, thus: Cum itaque natum semper esse, nihil
   aliud sit confitendum esse, quam natum, id sensui, antequam nascitur
   vel fuisse, vel non fuisse non subjacet. n. 31.'

   9. It may seem superfluous to proceed, but as Bishop Bull is an
   authority not lightly to be set aside, a passage from S. Basil shall be
   added. Eunomius objects, God begat the Son either being or not being,
   &c....to him that is, there needs not generation.' He replies that
   Eunomius, because animals first are not, and then are generated, and he
   who is born to-day, yesterday did not exist, transfers this conception
   to the subsistence of the Only-begotten; and says, since He has been
   generated, He was not before His generation, pro tes genneseos,' contr.
   Eunom. ii. 14. And he solves the objection as the other Fathers, by
   saying that our Lord is from everlasting, speaking of S. John, in the
   first words of his Gospel, as te a& 187;dioteti tou patros tou
   monogenous sunapton ten gennesin. Â§15.

   These then being the explanations which the contemporary and next
   following Fathers give of the Arian formula which was anathematized at
   NicÃ¦a, it must be observed that the line of argument which Bishop Bull
   is pursuing, does not lead him to assign any direct reasons for the
   substitution of a different interpretation in their place. He is
   engaged, not in commenting on the Nicene Anathema, but in proving that
   the Post-Nicene Fathers admitted that view or statement of doctrine
   which he conceives also implied in that anathema; and thus the sense of
   the anathema, instead of being the subject of proof, is, as he
   believes, one of the proofs of the point which he is establishing.
   However, since these other collateral evidences which he adduces, may
   be taken to be some sort of indirect comment upon the words of the
   Anathema, the principal of them in point of authority, and that which
   most concerns us, shall here be noticed: it is a passage from the
   second Oration of Athanasius.

   While commenting on the words, arche hodon eis ta erga in the text, The
   Lord has created me the beginning of His ways unto the works,' S.
   Athanasius is led to consider the text first born of every creature,'
   prototokos pases ktiseos: and he says that He who was monogenes from
   eternity, became by a sunkatabasis at the creation of the world
   prototokos. This doctrine Bp. Bull considers declaratory of a going
   forth, proeleusis, or figurative birth from the Father, at the
   beginning of all things.

   It will be observed that the very point to be proved is this, viz. not
   that there was a sunkatabasis merely, but that according to Athanasius
   there was a gennesis or proceeding from the Father, and that the word
   prototokos marks it. Bull's words are, that Catholici quidam Doctores,
   qui post exortam controversiam Arianam vixerunt,...illam tou
   logou....ex Patre progressionem (quod et sunkatabasin, hoc est,
   condescensionem eorum nonnulli appellarunt), ad condendum hÃ¦c universa
   agnovere; atque ejus etiam progressionis respectu ipsum ton logon a Deo
   Patre quasi natum fuisse et omnis creaturÃ¦ primogenitum in Scripturis
   dici confessi sunt.' D. F. N. iii. 9. Â§1. Now I consider that S.
   Athanasius does not, as this sentence says, understand by primogenitus
   that our Lord was progressionis respectu a Deo Patre quasi natus.' He
   does not seem to me to speak of a generation or birth of the Son at
   all, though figurative, but of the birth of all things, and that in
   Him.

   That Athanasius does not call the sunkatabasis of the Word a birth, as
   denoted by the term prototokos, is plain from his own avowal in the
   passage to which Bull refers. Nowhere in the Scriptures,' he says, is
   He called prototokos tou Theou, first-born of God, nor creature of God,
   but Only-begotten, Word, Wisdom, have their relation to the Father, and
   are proper to Him.' ii. 62. Here surely he expressly denies Bull's
   statement that first-born' means a Deo natus,' born of God.' Such
   additions as para tou patros, he says, are reserved for monogenes and
   logos.

   He goes on to say what the term prototokos does mean; viz. instead of
   having any reference to a proeleusis from the Father, it refers solely
   to the creatures; our Lord is not called prototokos, because His
   proeleusis is a type of His eternal generation,' but because by that
   proeleusis He became the Prototype of all creation.' He, as it were,
   stamped His image, His Sonship, upon creation, and became the
   first-born in the sense of being the Archetypal Son. If this is borne
   out by the passage, Athanasius, it is plain, does not speak of any
   gennesis whatever at the era of creation, though figurative; prototokos
   does but mean monogenes proteuon en te ktisei, or arche tes ktiseos, or
   prototupon gennema, or monos gennetos en tois genetois; and no warrant
   is given, however indirect, to the idea that in the Nicene Anathema,
   the Fathers implied an allowance of the proposition, He was before His
   generation.'

   As the whole passage occurs in the Discourse which immediately follows,
   it is not necessary to enter formally into the proof of this view of
   it, when the reader will soon be able to judge of it for himself. But
   it may be well to add two passages, one from Athenagoras, the other
   from S. Cyril, not in elucidation of the words of Athanasius, but of
   the meaning which I would put upon them.

   The passage from Athenagoras is quoted by Bull himself, who of course
   is far from denying the doctrine of our Lord's Archetypal office; and
   does but wish in addition to find in Athanasius the doctrine of a
   gennesis. Athenagoras says that the Son is the first offspring, proton
   gennema, of the Father, not as come to be, genomenon (for God being
   Eternal Mind had from the beginning in Himself the Word, as having
   Reason eternally, logikos on), but that while as regards matter heavy
   and light were mixed together' (the passage is corrupt here), He went
   forth, proelthon, as an idea and energy', i.e. as an Agent to create,
   and a Form and Rule to create by. And then he goes on to quote the very
   text on which Athanasius is employed when he explains prototokos. And
   the Prophetic Spirit confirms this doctrine, saying, The Lord hath
   created me a beginning (origin) of His ways, for His works.' Leg. 10.

   And so S. Cyril, He is Only-begotten according to nature, as being
   alone from the Father, God from God, Light kindled from Light; and He
   is First-born for our sakes, that, as if to some immortal root the
   whole creation might be ingrafted and might bud forth from the
   Everlasting. For all things were made by Him, and consist for ever and
   are preserved in Him.' Thesaur. 25 p. 238.

   In conclusion it may be suggested whether the same explanation which
   has here been given of Athanasius's use of prototokos does not avail
   more exactly to the defence of two of the five writers from the charge
   of inaccurate doctrine, than that which Bull has preferred.

   As to Athenagoras, we have already seen that he does not speak of a
   gennesis at all in his account of creation, but simply calls the Son
   proton gennema, i.e. prototupon gennema.

   Nor does Tatian approach nearer to the doctrine of a gennesis. He says
   that at the creation the Word ergon prototokon tou patros ginetai.
   touton ismen tou kosmou ten archen. ad GrÃ¦c. 5. Here the word ergon,
   which at first sight promises a difficulty, does in fact explain both
   himself and Athenagoras. He says that at creation the Word became,
   ginetai, not a Son (figuratively), as Bull would grant to the parties
   whom he is opposing, but a work. It was His great condescension,
   sunkatabasis, to be accounted the first of the works, as being their
   type; that as they were to be raised to an adoption and called sons, so
   He for that purpose might stoop to creation, and be called a work. As
   Tatian uses the word arche in the concluding clause, there is great
   reason to think that he is alluding to the very text which Athanasius
   and Athenagoras expressly quote, in which Wisdom is said to be created
   a beginning, arche, of ways, unto the works, eis ta erga.'

   As to Novatian, Bishop Bull himself observes that it is a question
   whether he need be understood to speak of any generation but that which
   is eternal; nor does Pamelius otherwise explain him.

   Discourse II.

   ------------------------

   Chapter XIV.--Texts explained; Fourthly, Hebrews iii. 2 Introduction;
   the Regula Fidei counter to an Arian sense of the text; which is not
   supported by the word servant,' nor by made' which occurs in it; (how
   can the Judge be among the works' which God will bring into judgment?')
   nor by faithful;' and is confuted by the immediate context, which is
   about Priesthood; and by the foregoing passage, which explains the word
   faithful' as meaning trustworthy, as do 1 Pet. iv. fin. and other
   texts. On the whole made may safely be understood either of the divine
   generation or the human creation.

   1. I did indeed think that enough had been said already against the
   hollow professors of Arius's madness, whether for their refutation or
   in the truth's behalf, to insure a cessation and repentance of their
   evil thoughts and words about the Saviour. They, however, for whatever
   reason, still do not succumb; but, as swine and dogs wallow [2210] in
   their own vomit and their own mire, rather invent new expedients for
   their irreligion. Thus they misunderstand the passage in the Proverbs,
   The Lord hath created me a beginning of His ways for His works [2211]
   ,' and the words of the Apostle, Who was faithful to Him that made Him
   [2212] ,' and straightway argue, that the Son of God is a work and a
   creature. But although they might have learned from what is said above,
   had they not utterly lost their power of apprehension, that the Son is
   not from nothing nor in the number of things originate at all, the
   Truth witnessing [2213] it (for, being God, He cannot be a work, and it
   is impious to call Him a creature, and it is of creatures and works
   that we say, out of nothing,' and it was not before its generation'),
   yet since, as if dreading to desert their own fiction, they are
   accustomed to allege the aforesaid passages of divine Scripture, which
   have a good meaning, but are by them practised on, let us proceed
   afresh to take up the question of the sense of these, to remind the
   faithful, and to shew from each of these passages that they have no
   knowledge at all of Christianity. Were it otherwise, they would not
   have shut themselves up in the unbelief [2214] of the present Jews
   [2215] , but would have inquired and learned [2216] that, whereas In
   the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
   God,' in consequence, it was when at the good pleasure of the Father
   the Word became man, that it was said of Him, as by John, The Word
   became flesh [2217] ;' so by Peter, He hath made Him Lord and Christ
   [2218] ';--as by means of Solomon in the Person of the Lord Himself,
   The Lord created me a beginning of His ways for His works [2219] ;' so
   by Paul, Become so much better than the Angels [2220] ;' and again, He
   emptied Himself, and took upon Him the form of a servant [2221] ;' and
   again, Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling,
   consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Jesus, who was
   faithful to Him that made Him [2222] .' For all these texts have the
   same force and meaning, a religious one, declarative of the divinity of
   the Word, even those of them which speak humanly concerning Him, as
   having become the Son of man. But, though this distinction is
   sufficient for their refutation, still, since from a misconception of
   the Apostle's words (to mention them first), they consider the Word of
   God to be one of the works, because of its being written, Who was
   faithful to Him that made Him,' I have thought it needful to silence
   this further argument of theirs, taking in hand [2223] , as before,
   their statement.

   2. If then He be not a Son, let Him be called a work, and let all that
   is said of works be said of Him, nor let Him and Him alone be called
   Son, nor Word, nor Wisdom; neither let God be called Father, but only
   Framer and Creator of things which by Him come to be; and let the
   creature be Image and Expression of His framing will, and let Him, as
   they would have it, be without generative nature, so that there be
   neither Word, nor Wisdom, no, nor Image, of His proper substance. For
   if He be not Son [2224] , neither is He Image [2225] . But if there be
   not a Son, how then say you that God is a Creator? since all things
   that come to be are through the Word and in Wisdom, and without This
   nothing can be, whereas you say He hath not That in and through which
   He makes all things. For if the Divine Essence be not fruitful itself
   [2226] , but barren, as they hold, as a light that lightens not, and a
   dry fountain, are they not ashamed to speak of His possessing framing
   energy? and whereas they deny what is by nature, do they not blush to
   place before it what is by will [2227] ? But if He frames things that
   are external to Him and before were not, by willing them to be, and
   becomes their Maker, much more will He first be Father of an Offspring
   from His proper Essence. For if they attribute to God the willing about
   things which are not, why recognise they not that in God which lies
   above the will? now it is a something that surpasses will, that He
   should be by nature, and should be Father of His proper Word. If then
   that which comes first, which is according to nature, did not exist, as
   they would have it in their folly, how could that which is second come
   to be, which is according to will? for the Word is first, and then the
   creation. On the contrary the Word exists, whatever they affirm, those
   irreligious ones; for through Him did creation come to be, and God, as
   being Maker, plainly has also His framing Word, not external, but
   proper to Him;--for this must be repeated. If He has the power of will,
   and His will is effective, and suffices for the consistence of the
   things that come to be, and His Word is effective, and a Framer, that
   Word must surely be the living Will [2228] of the Father, and an
   essential [2229] energy, and a real Word, in whom all things both
   consist and are excellently governed. No one can even doubt, that He
   who disposes is prior to the disposition and the things disposed. And
   thus, as I said, God's creating is second to His begetting; for Son
   implies something proper to Him and truly from that blessed and
   everlasting Essence; but what is from His will, comes into consistence
   from without, and is framed through His proper Offspring who is from
   It.

   3. As we have shewn then they are guilty of great extravagance who say
   that the Lord is not Son of God, but a work, and it follows that we all
   of necessity confess that He is Son. And if He be Son, as indeed He is,
   and a son is confessed to be not external to his father but from him,
   let them not question about the terms, as I said before, which the
   sacred writers use of the Word Himself, viz. not to Him that begat
   Him,' but to Him that made Him;' for while it is confessed what His
   nature is, what word is used in such instances need raise no question
   [2230] . For terms do not disparage His Nature; rather that Nature
   draws to Itself those terms and changes them. For terms are not prior
   to essences, but essences are first, and terms second. Wherefore also
   when the essence is a work or creature, then the words He made,' and He
   became,' and He created,' are used of it properly, and designate the
   work. But when the Essence is an Offspring and Son, then He made,' and
   He became,' and He created,' no longer properly belong to it, nor
   designate a work; but He made' we use without question for He begat.'
   Thus fathers often call the sons born of them their servants, yet
   without denying the genuineness of their nature; and often they
   affectionately call their own servants children, yet without putting
   out of sight their purchase of them originally; for they use the one
   appellation from their authority as being fathers, but in the other
   they speak from affection. Thus Sara called Abraham lord, though not a
   servant but a wife; and while to Philemon the master the Apostle joined
   Onesimus the servant as a brother, Bathsheba, although mother, called
   her son servant, saying to his father, Thy servant Solomon [2231]
   ;'--afterwards also Nathan the Prophet came in and repeated her words
   to David, Solomon thy servant [2232] .' Nor did they mind calling the
   son a servant, for while David heard it, he recognised the nature,' and
   while they spoke it, they forgot not the genuineness,' praying that he
   might be made his father's heir, to whom they gave the name of servant;
   for to David he was son by nature.

   4. As then, when we read this, we interpret it fairly, without
   accounting Solomon a servant because we hear him so called, but a son
   natural and genuine, so also, if, concerning the Saviour, who is
   confessed to be in truth the Son, and to be the Word by nature, the
   saints say, Who was faithful to Him that made Him,' or if He say of
   Himself, The Lord created me,' and, I am Thy servant and the Son of
   Thine handmaid [2233] ,' and the like, let not any on this account deny
   that He is proper to the Father and from Him; but, as in the case of
   Solomon and David, let them have a right idea of the Father and the
   Son. For if, though they hear Solomon called a servant, they
   acknowledge him to be a son, are they not deserving of many deaths
   [2234] , who, instead of preserving the same explanation in the
   instance of the Lord, whenever they hear Offspring,' and Word,' and
   Wisdom,' forcibly misinterpret and deny the generation, natural and
   genuine, of the Son from the Father; but on hearing words and terms
   proper to a work, forthwith drop down to the notion of His being by
   nature a work, and deny the Word; and this, though it is possible, from
   His having been made man, to refer all these terms to His humanity? And
   are they not proved to be an abomination' also unto the Lord,' as
   having diverse weights [2235] ' with them, and with this estimating
   those other instances, and with that blaspheming the Lord? But perhaps
   they grant that the word servant' is used under a certain
   understanding, but lay stress upon Who made' as some great support of
   their heresy. But this stay of theirs also is but a broken reed; for if
   they are aware of the style of Scripture, they must at once give
   sentence against [2236] themselves. For as Solomon, though a son, is
   called a servant, so, to repeat what was said above, although parents
   call the sons springing from themselves made' and created' and
   becoming,' for all this they do not deny their nature. Thus Hezekiah,
   as it is written in Isaiah, said in his prayer, From this day I will
   make children, who shall declare Thy righteousness, O God of my
   salvation [2237] .' He then said, I will make;' but the Prophet in that
   very book and the Fourth of Kings, thus speaks, And the sons who shall
   come forth of thee [2238] .' He uses then make' for beget,' and he
   calls them who were to spring from him, made,' and no one questions
   whether the term has reference to a natural offspring. Again, Eve on
   bearing Cain said, I have gotten a man from the Lord [2239] ;' thus she
   too used gotten' for brought forth.' For, first she saw the child, yet
   next she said, I have gotten.' Nor would any one consider, because of I
   have gotten,' that Cain was purchased from without, instead of being
   born of her. Again, the Patriarch Jacob said to Joseph, And now thy two
   sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which became thine in Egypt, before I came
   unto thee into Egypt, are mine [2240] .' And Scripture says about Job,
   And there came to him seven sons and three daughters [2241] .' As Moses
   too has said in the Law, If sons become to any one,' and If he make a
   son [2242] .' Here again they speak of those who are begotten, as
   become' and made,' knowing that, while they are acknowledged to be
   sons, we need not make a question of they became,' or I have gotten,'
   or I made [2243] .' For nature and truth draw the meaning to
   themselves.

   5. This being so [2244] , when persons ask whether the Lord is a
   creature or work, it is proper to ask of them this first, whether He is
   Son and Word and Wisdom. For if this is shewn, the surmise about work
   and creation falls to the ground at once and is ended. For a work could
   never be Son and Word; nor could the Son be a work. And again, this
   being the state of the case, the proof is plain to all, that the
   phrase, To Him who made Him' does not serve their heresy, but rather
   condemns it. For it has been shewn that the expression He made' is
   applied in divine Scripture even to children genuine and natural;
   whence, the Lord being proved to be the Father's Son naturally and
   genuinely, and Word, and Wisdom, though He made' be used concerning
   Him, or He became,' this is not said of Him as if a work, but the
   saints make no question about using the expression,--for instance in
   the case of Solomon, and Hezekiah's children. For though the fathers
   had begotten them from themselves, still it is written, I have made,'
   and I have gotten,' and He became.' Therefore God's enemies, in spite
   of their repeated allegation of such phrases [2245] , ought now, though
   late in the day, after what has been said, to disown their irreligious
   thoughts, and think of the Lord as of a true Son, Word, and Wisdom of
   the Father, not a work, not a creature. For if the Son be a creature,
   by what word then and by what wisdom was He made Himself [2246] ? for
   all the works were made through the Word and the Wisdom, as it is
   written, In wisdom hast Thou made them all,' and, All things were made
   by Him, and without Him was not anything made [2247] .' But if it be He
   who is the Word and the Wisdom, by which all things come to be, it
   follows that He is not in the number of works, nor in short of things
   originate, but the Offspring of the Father.

   6. For consider how grave an error it is, to call God's Word a work.
   Solomon says in one place in Ecclesiastes, that God shall bring every
   work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good or
   whether it be evil [2248] .' If then the Word be a work, do you mean
   that He as well as others will be brought into judgment? and what room
   is there for judgment, when the Judge is on trial? who will give to the
   just their blessing, who to the unworthy their punishment, the Lord, as
   you must suppose, standing on trial with the rest? by what law shall
   He, the Lawgiver, Himself be judged? These things are proper to the
   works, to be on trial, to be blessed and to be punished by the Son. Now
   then fear the Judge, and let Solomon's words convince you. For if God
   shall bring the works one and all into judgment, but the Son is not in
   the number of things put on trial, but rather is Himself the Judge of
   works one and all, is not the proof clearer than the sun, that the Son
   is not a work but the Father's Word, in whom all the works both come to
   be and come into judgment? Further, if the expression, Who was
   faithful,' is a difficulty to them, from the thought that faithful' is
   used of Him as of others, as if He exercises faith and so receives the
   reward of faith, they must proceed at this rate to find fault with
   Moses for saying, God faithful and true [2249] ,' and with St. Paul for
   writing, God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above
   that ye are able [2250] .' But when the saints spoke thus, they were
   not thinking of God in a human way, but they acknowledged two senses of
   the word faithful' in Scripture, first believing,' then trustworthy,'
   of which the former belongs to man, the latter to God. Thus Abraham was
   faithful, because He believed God's word; and God faithful, for, as
   David says in the Psalm, The Lord is faithful in all His words [2251]
   ,' or is trustworthy, and cannot lie. Again, If any faithful woman have
   widows [2252] ,' she is so called for her right faith; but, It is a
   faithful saying [2253] ,' because what He hath spoken has a claim on
   our faith, for it is true, and is not otherwise. Accordingly the words,
   Who is faithful to Him that made Him,' implies no parallel with others,
   nor means that by having faith He became well-pleasing; but that, being
   Son of the True God, He too is faithful, and ought to be believed in
   all He says and does, Himself remaining unalterable and not changed
   [2254] in His human Economy and fleshly presence.

   7. Thus then we may meet these men who are shameless, and from the
   single expression He made,' may shew that they err in thinking that the
   Word of God is a work. But further, since the drift also of the context
   is orthodox, shewing the time and the relation to which this expression
   points, I ought to shew from it also how the heretics lack reason; viz.
   by considering, as we have done above, the occasion when it was used
   and for what purpose. Now the Apostle is not discussing things before
   the creation when he thus speaks, but when the Word became flesh;' for
   thus it is written, Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly
   calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession Jesus,
   who was faithful to Him that made Him.' Now when became He Apostle,'
   but when He put on our flesh? and when became He High Priest of our
   profession,' but when, after offering Himself for us, He raised His
   Body from the dead, and, as now, Himself brings near and offers to the
   Father those who in faith approach Him, redeeming all, and for all
   propitiating God? Not then as wishing to signify the Essence of the
   Word nor His natural generation from the Father, did the Apostle say,
   Who was faithful to Him that made Him'--(perish the thought! for the
   Word is not made, but makes)--but as signifying His descent to mankind
   and High-priesthood which did become'--as one may easily see from the
   account given of the Law and of Aaron. I mean, Aaron was not born a
   high-priest, but a man; and in process of time, when God willed, he
   became a high-priest; yet became so, not simply, nor as betokened by
   his ordinary garments, but putting over them the ephod, the breastplate
   [2255] , the robe, which the women wrought at God's command, and going
   in them into the holy place, he offered the sacrifice for the people;
   and in them, as it were, mediated between the vision of God and the
   sacrifices of men. Thus then the Lord also, In the beginning was the
   Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God;' but when the
   Father willed that ransoms should be paid for all and to all, grace
   should be given, then truly the Word, as Aaron his robe, so did He take
   earthly flesh, having Mary for the Mother of His Body as if virgin
   earth [2256] , that, as a High Priest, having He as others an offering,
   He might offer Himself to the Father, and cleanse us all from sins in
   His own blood, and might rise from the dead.

   8. For what happened of old was a shadow of this; and what the Saviour
   did on His coming, this Aaron shadowed out according to the Law. As
   then Aaron was the same and did not change by putting on the
   high-priestly dress [2257] , but remaining the same was only robed, so
   that, had any one seen him offering, and had said, Lo, Aaron has this
   day become high-priest,' he had not implied that he then had been born
   man, for man he was even before he became high-priest, but that he had
   been made high-priest in his ministry, on putting on the garments made
   and prepared for the high-priesthood; in the same way it is possible in
   the Lord's instance also to understand aright, that He did not become
   other than Himself on taking the flesh, but, being the same as before,
   He was robed in it; and the expressions He became' and He was made,'
   must not be understood as if the Word, considered as the Word [2258] ,
   were made, but that the Word, being Framer of all, afterwards [2259]
   was made High Priest, by putting on a body which was originate and
   made, and such as He can offer for us; wherefore He is said to be made.
   If then indeed the Lord did not become man [2260] , that is a point for
   the Arians to battle; but if the Word became flesh,' what ought to have
   been said concerning Him when become man, but Who was faithful to Him
   that made Him?' for as it is proper to the Word to have it said of Him,
   In the beginning was the Word,' so it is proper to man to become' and
   to be made.' Who then, on seeing the Lord as a man walking about, and
   yet appearing to be God from His works, would not have asked, Who made
   Him man? and who again, on such a question, would not have answered,
   that the Father made Him man, and sent Him to us as High Priest? And
   this meaning, and time, and character, the Apostle himself, the writer
   of the words, Who is faithful to Him that made Him,' will best make
   plain to us, if we attend to what goes before them. For there is one
   train of thought, and the lection is all about One and the Same. He
   writes then in the Epistle to the Hebrews thus; Forasmuch then as the
   children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise
   took part of the same; that through death He might destroy him that had
   the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through
   fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. For verily He
   took not on Him the nature of Angels; but He took on Him the seed of
   Abraham. Wherefore in all things it behoved Him to be made like unto
   His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in
   things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the
   people. For in that He Himself hath suffered being tempted, He is able
   to succour them that are tempted. Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers
   of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our
   profession, Jesus; who was faithful to Him that made Him [2261] .'

   9. Who can read this whole passage without condemning the Arians, and
   admiring the blessed Apostle, who has spoken well? for when was Christ
   made,' when became He Apostle,' except when, like us, He took part in
   flesh and blood?' And when became He a merciful and faithful High
   Priest,' except when in all things He was made like unto His brethren?'
   And then was He made like,' when He became man, having put upon Him our
   flesh. Wherefore Paul was writing concerning the Word's human Economy,
   when he said, Who was faithful to Him that made Him,' and not
   concerning His Essence. Have not therefore any more the madness to say
   that the Word of God is a work; whereas He is Son by nature
   Only-begotten, and then had brethren,' when He took on Him flesh like
   ours; which moreover, by Himself offering Himself, He was named and
   became merciful and faithful,'--merciful, because in mercy to us He
   offered Himself for us, and faithful, not as sharing faith with us, nor
   as having faith in any one as we have, but as deserving to receive
   faith in all He says and does, and as offering a faithful sacrifice,
   one which remains and does not come to nought. For those which were
   offered according to the Law, had not this faithfulness, passing away
   with the day and needing a further cleansing; but the Saviour's
   sacrifice, taking place once, has perfected everything, and is become
   faithful as remaining for ever. And Aaron had successors, and in a word
   the priesthood under the Law exchanged its first ministers as time and
   death went on; but the Lord having a high priesthood without transition
   and without succession, has become a faithful High Priest,' as
   continuing for ever; and faithful too by promise, that He may hear
   [2262] and not mislead those who come to Him. This may be also learned
   from the Epistle of the great Peter, who says, Let them that suffer
   according to the will of God, commit their souls to a faithful Creator
   [2263] .' For He is faithful as not changing, but abiding ever, and
   rendering what He has promised.

   10. Now the so-called gods of the Greeks, unworthy the name, are
   faithful neither in their essence nor in their promises; for the same
   are not everywhere, nay, the local deities come to nought in course of
   time, and undergo a natural dissolution; wherefore the Word cries out
   against them, that faith is not strong in them,' but they are waters
   that fail,' and there is no faith in them.' But the God of all, being
   one really and indeed and true, is faithful, who is ever the same, and
   says, See now, that I, even I am He,' and I change not [2264] ;' and
   therefore His Son is faithful,' being ever the same and unchanging,
   deceiving neither in His essence nor in His promise;--as again says the
   Apostle writing to the Thessalonians, Faithful is He who calleth you,
   who also will do it [2265] ;' for in doing what He promises, He is
   faithful to His words.' And he thus writes to the Hebrews as to the
   word's meaning unchangeable;' If we believe not, yet He abideth
   faithful; He cannot deny Himself [2266] .' Therefore reasonably the
   Apostle, discoursing concerning the bodily presence of the Word, says,
   an Apostle and faithful to Him that made Him,' shewing us that, even
   when made man, Jesus Christ' is the same yesterday, and to-day, and for
   ever [2267] ' is unchangeable. And as the Apostle makes mention in his
   Epistle of His being made man when mentioning His High Priesthood, so
   too he kept no long silence about His Godhead, but rather mentions it
   forthwith, furnishing to us a safeguard on every side, and most of all
   when he speaks of His humility, that we may forthwith know His
   loftiness and His majesty which is the Father's. For instance, he says,
   Moses as a servant, but Christ as a Son [2268] ;' and the former
   faithful in his house,' and the latter over the house,' as having
   Himself built it, and being its Lord and Framer, and as God sanctifying
   it. For Moses, a man by nature, became faithful, in believing God who
   spoke to Him by His Word; but [2269] the Word was not as one of things
   originate in a body, nor as creature in creature, but as God in flesh
   [2270] , and Framer of all and Builder in that which was built by Him.
   And men are clothed in flesh in order to be and to subsist; but the
   Word of God was made man in order to sanctify the flesh, and, though He
   was Lord, was in the form of a servant; for the whole creature is the
   Word's servant, which by Him came to be, and was made.

   11. Hence it holds that the Apostle's expression, He made,' does not
   prove that the Word is made, but that body, which He took like ours;
   and in consequence He is called our brother, as having become man. But
   if it has been shewn, that, even though the word made' be referred to
   the Very Word, it is used for begat,' what further perverse expedient
   will they be able to fall upon, now that the present discussion has
   cleared up the word in every point of view, and shewn that the Son is
   not a work, but in Essence indeed the Father's offspring, while in the
   Economy, according to the good pleasure [2271] of the Father, He was on
   our behalf made, and consists as man? For this reason then it is said
   by the Apostle, Who was faithful to Him that made Him;' and in the
   Proverbs, even creation is spoken of. For so long as we are confessing
   that He became man, there is no question about saying, as was observed
   before, whether He became,' or He has been made,' or created,' or
   formed,' or servant,' or son of an handmaid,' or son of man,' or was
   constituted,' or took His journey,' or bridegroom,' or brother's son,'
   or brother.' All these terms happen to be proper to man's constitution;
   and such as these do not designate the Essence of the Word, but that He
   has become man.

   [2254] atreptos kai me alloioumenos; vid. supr. de Decr. 14. it was the
   tendency of Arianism to consider that in the Incarnation some such
   change actually was undergone by the Word, as they had from the first
   maintained in the abstract was possible; that whereas He was in nature
   treptos, He was in fact alloioumenos. This was implied in the doctrine
   that His superhuman nature supplied the place of a soul in His manhood.
   Hence the semi-Arian Sirmian Creed anathematizes those who said, ton
   logon tropen hupomemenekota, vid. De Syn. 27. 12). This doctrine
   connected them with the Apollinarian and Eutychian Schools, to the

   [2257] This is one of those distinct and luminous protests by
   anticipation against Nestorianism, which in consequence may be abused
   to the purpose of the opposite heresy. Such expressions as
   peritithemenos ten estheta, ekalupteto, endusamenos soma, were familiar
   with the Apollinarians, against whom S. Athanasius is, if possible,
   even more decided. Theodoret objects HÃ¦r. v. 11. p. 422. to the word

   [2259] The Arians considered that our Lord's Priesthood preceded His

   the token of an inferior divinity. The notice of it therefore in this
   text did but confirm them in their interpretation of the words made,
   &c. For the Arians, vid. Epiph. HÃ¦r. 69, 37. Eusebius too had

   Chapter XV.--Texts explained; Fifthly, Acts ii. 36. The Regula Fidei
   must be observed; madeapplies to our Lord's manhood; and to His
   manifestation; and to His office relative to us; and is relative to the
   Jews. Parallel instance in Gen. xxvii. 29, 37. The context contradicts
   the Arian interpretation.

   11 (continued). The same is the meaning of the passage in the Acts
   which they also allege, that in which Peter says, that He hath made
   both Lord and Christ that same Jesus whom ye have crucified.' For here
   too it is not written, He made for Himself a Son,' or He made Himself a
   Word,' that they should have such notions. If then it has not escaped
   their memory, that they speak concerning the Son of God, let them make
   search whether it is anywhere written, God made Himself a Son,' or He
   created for Himself a Word;' or again, whether it is anywhere written
   in plain terms, The Word is a work or creation;' and then let them
   proceed to make their case, the insensate men, that here too they may
   receive their answer. But if they can produce nothing of the kind, and
   only catch at such stray expressions as He made' and He has been made,'
   I fear lest, from hearing, In the beginning God made the heaven and the
   earth,' and He made the sun and the moon,' and He made the sea,' they
   should come in time to call the Word the heaven, and the Light which
   took place on the first day, and the earth, and each particular thing
   that has been made, so as to end in resembling the Stoics, as they are
   called, the one drawing out their God into all things [2272] , the
   other ranking God's Word with each work in particular; which they have
   well nigh done already, saying that He is one of His works.

   12. But here they must have the same answer as before, and first be
   told that the Word is a Son, as has been said above [2273] , and not a
   work, and that such terms are not to be understood of His Godhead, but
   the reason and manner of them investigated. To persons who so inquire,
   the human Economy will plainly present itself, which He undertook for
   our sake. For Peter, after saying, He hath made Lord and Christ,'
   straightway added, this Jesus whom ye crucified;' which makes it plain
   to any one, even, if so be, to them, provided they attend to the
   context, that not the Essence of the Word, but He according to His
   manhood is said to have been made. For what was crucified but the body?
   and how could be signified what was bodily in the Word, except by
   saying He made?' Especially has that phrase, He made,' a meaning
   consistent with orthodoxy; in that he has not said, as I observed
   before, He made Him Word,' but He made Him Lord,' nor that in general
   terms [2274] , but towards' us, and in the midst of' us, as much as to
   say, He manifested Him.' And this Peter himself, when he began this
   primary teaching, carefully [2275] expressed, when he said to them, Ye
   men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man manifested of
   God towards you by miracles, and wonders, and signs, which God did by
   Him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves know [2276] .' Consequently
   the term which he uses in the end, made', this He has explained in the
   beginning by manifested,' for by the signs and wonders which the Lord
   did, He was manifested to be not merely man, but God in a body and Lord
   also, the Christ. Such also is the passage in the Gospel according to
   John, Therefore the more did the Jews persecute Him, because He not
   only broke the Sabbath, but said also that God was His own Father,
   making Himself equal with God [2277] .' For the Lord did not then
   fashion Himself to be God, nor indeed is a made God conceivable, but He
   manifested it by the works, saying, Though ye believe not Me, believe
   My works, that ye may know that I am in the Father, and the Father in
   Me [2278] .' Thus then the Father has made' Him Lord and King in the
   midst of us, and towards us who were once disobedient; and it is plain
   that He who is now displayed as Lord and King, does not then begin to
   be King and Lord, but begins to shew His Lordship, and to extend it
   even over the disobedient.

   13. If then they suppose that the Saviour was not Lord and King, even
   before He became man and endured the Cross, but then began to be Lord,
   let them know that they are openly reviving the statements of the
   Samosatene. But if, as we have quoted and declared above, He is Lord
   and King everlasting, seeing that Abraham worships Him as Lord, and
   Moses says, Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone
   and fire from the Lord out of heaven [2279] ;' and David in the Psalms,
   The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on My right hand [2280] ;' and,
   Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a sceptre of righteousness is
   the sceptre of Thy Kingdom [2281] ;' and, Thy Kingdom is an everlasting
   Kingdom [2282] ;' it is plain that even before He became man, He was
   King and Lord everlasting, being Image and Word of the Father. And the
   Word being everlasting Lord and King, it is very plain again that Peter
   said not that the Essence of the Son was made, but spoke of His
   Lordship over us, which became' when He became man, and, redeeming all
   by the Cross, became Lord of all and King. But if they continue the
   argument on the ground of its being written, He made,' not willing that
   He made' should be taken in the sense of He manifested,' either from
   want of apprehension, or from their Christ-opposing purpose, let them
   attend to another sound exposition of Peter's words. For he who becomes
   Lord of others, comes into the possession of beings already in
   existence; but if the Lord is Framer of all and everlasting King, and
   when He became man, then gained possession of us, here too is a way in
   which Peter's language evidently does not signify that the Essence of
   the Word is a work, but the after-subjection of all things, and the
   Saviour's Lordship which came to be over all. And this coincides with
   what we said before [2283] ; for as we then introduced the words,
   Become my God and defence,' and the Lord became a refuge for the
   oppressed [2284] ,' and it stood to reason that these expressions do
   not shew that God is originate, but that His beneficence becomes'
   towards each individual, the same sense has the expression of Peter
   also.

   14. For the Son of God indeed, being Himself the Word, is Lord of all;
   but we once were subject from the first to the slavery of corruption
   and the curse of the Law, then by degrees fashioning for ourselves
   things that were not, we served, as says the blessed Apostle, them
   which by nature are no Gods [2285] ,' and, ignorant of the true God, we
   preferred things that were not to the truth; but afterwards, as the
   ancient people when oppressed in Egypt groaned, so, when we too had the
   Law engrafted [2286] ' in us, and according to the unutterable sighings
   [2287] of the Spirit made our intercession, O Lord our God, take
   possession of us [2288] ,' then, as He became for a house of refuge'
   and a God and defence,' so also He became our Lord. Nor did He then
   begin to be, but we began to have Him for our Lord. For upon this, God
   being good and Father of the Lord, in pity, and desiring to be known by
   all, makes His own Son put on Him a human body and become man, and be
   called Jesus, that in this body offering Himself for all, He might
   deliver all from false worship and corruption, and might Himself become
   of all Lord and King. His becoming therefore in this way Lord and King,
   this it is that Peter means by, He hath made Him Lord,' and hath sent
   Christ;' as much as to say, that the Father in making Him man (for to
   be made belongs to man), did not simply make Him man, but has made Him
   in order to His being Lord of all men, and to His hallowing all through
   the Anointing. For though the Word existing in the form of God took a
   servant's form, yet the assumption of the flesh did not make a servant
   [2289] of the Word, who was by nature Lord; but rather, not only was it
   that emancipation of all humanity which takes place by the Word, but
   that very Word who was by nature Lord, and was then made man, hath by
   means of a servant's form been made Lord of all and Christ, that is, in
   order to hallow all by the Spirit. And as God, when becoming a God and
   defence,' and saying, I will be a God to them,' does not then become
   God more than before, nor then begins to become God, but, what He ever
   is, that He then becomes to those who need Him, when it pleaseth Him,
   so Christ also being by nature Lord and King everlasting, does not
   become Lord more than He was at the time He is sent forth, nor then
   begins to be Lord and King, but what He is ever, that He then is made
   according to the flesh; and, having redeemed all, He becomes thereby
   again Lord of quick and dead. For Him henceforth do all things serve,
   and this is David's meaning in the Psalm, The Lord said unto my Lord,
   Sit Thou on My right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool
   [2290] .' For it was fitting that the redemption should take place
   through none other than Him who is the Lord by nature, lest, though
   created by the Son, we should name another Lord, and fall into the
   Arian and Greek folly, serving the creature beyond the all-creating God
   [2291] .

   15. This, at least according to my nothingness, is the meaning of this
   passage; moreover, a true and a good meaning have these words of Peter
   as regards the Jews. For Jews, astray from the truth, expect indeed the
   Christ as coming, but do not reckon that He undergoes a passion, saying
   what they understand not; We know that, when the Christ cometh, He
   abideth for ever, and how sayest Thou, that He must be lifted up [2292]
   ?' Next they suppose Him, not the Word coming in flesh, but a mere man,
   as were all the kings. The Lord then, admonishing Cleopas and the
   other, taught them that the Christ must first suffer; and the rest of
   the Jews that God was come among them, saying, If He called them gods
   to whom the word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken, say
   ye of Him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, Thou
   blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God [2293] ?'

   16. Peter then, having learned this from the Saviour, in both points
   set the Jews right, saying, "O Jews, the divine Scriptures announce
   that Christ cometh, and you consider Him a mere man as one of David's
   descendants, whereas what is written of Him shews Him to be not such as
   you say, but rather announces Him as Lord and God, and immortal, and
   dispenser of life. For Moses has said, Ye shall see your Life hanging
   before your eyes [2294] .' And David in the hundred and ninth Psalm,
   The Lord said unto My Lord, Sit Thou on My right hand, till I make
   Thine enemies Thy footstool [2295] ;' and in the fifteenth, Thou shalt
   not leave my soul in hades, neither shalt Thou suffer Thy Holy One to
   see corruption [2296] .' Now that these passages have not David for
   their scope he himself witnesses, avowing that He who was coming was
   His own Lord. Nay you yourselves know that He is dead, and His remains
   are with you. That the Christ then must be such as the Scriptures say,
   you will plainly confess yourselves. For those announcements come from
   God, and in them falsehood cannot be. If then ye can state that such a
   one has come before, and can prove him God from the signs and wonders
   which he did, ye have reason for maintaining the contest, but if ye are
   not able to prove His coming, but are expecting such an one still,
   recognise the true season from Daniel, for his words relate to the
   present time. But if this present season be that which was of old,
   afore-announced, and ye have seen what has taken place among us, be
   sure that this Jesus, whom ye crucified, this is the expected Christ.
   For David and all the Prophets died, and the sepulchres of all are with
   you, but that Resurrection which has now taken place, has shewn that
   the scope of these passages is Jesus. For the crucifixion is denoted by
   Ye shall see your Life hanging,' and the wound in the side by the spear
   answers to He was led as a sheep to the slaughter [2297] ,' and the
   resurrection, nay more, the rising of the ancient dead from out their
   sepulchres (for these most of you have seen), this is, Thou shalt not
   leave My soul in hades,' and He swallowed up death in strength [2298]
   ,' and again, God will wipe away.' For the signs which actually took
   place shew that He who was in a body was God, and also the Life and
   Lord of death. For it became the Christ, when giving life to others,
   Himself not to be detained by death; but this could not have happened,
   had He, as you suppose, been a mere man. But in truth He is the Son of
   God, for men are all subject to death. Let no one therefore doubt, but
   the whole house of Israel know assuredly that this Jesus, whom ye saw
   in shape a man, doing signs and such works, as no one ever yet had
   done, is Himself the Christ and Lord of all. For though made man, and
   called Jesus, as we said before, He received no loss by that human
   passion, but rather, in being made man, He is manifested as Lord of
   quick and dead. For since, as the Apostle said, in the wisdom of God
   the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of
   preaching to save them that believe [2299] .' And so, since we men
   would not acknowledge God through His Word, nor serve the Word of God
   our natural Master, it pleased God to shew in man His own Lordship, and
   so to draw all men to Himself. But to do this by a mere man beseemed
   not [2300] ; lest, having man for our Lord, we should become
   worshippers of man [2301] . Therefore the Word Himself became flesh,
   and the Father called His Name Jesus, and so made' Him Lord and Christ,
   as much as to say, He made Him to rule and to reign;' that while in the
   Name of Jesus, whom ye crucified, every knee bows, we may acknowledge
   as Lord and King both the Son and through Him the Father."

   17. The Jews then, most of them [2302] , hearing this, came to
   themselves and forthwith acknowledged the Christ, as it is written in
   the Acts. But, the Ario-maniacs on the contrary choose to remain Jews,
   and to contend with Peter; so let us proceed to place before them some
   parallel phrases; perhaps it may have some effect upon them, to find
   what the usage is of divine Scripture. Now that Christ is everlasting
   Lord and King, has become plain by what has gone before, nor is there a
   man to doubt about it; for being Son of God, He must be like Him [2303]
   , and being like, He is certainly both Lord and King, for He says
   Himself, He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father.' On the other
   hand, that Peter's mere words, He hath made Him both Lord and Christ,'
   do not imply the Son to be a creature, may be seen from Isaac's
   blessing, though this illustration is but a faint one for our subject.
   Now he said to Jacob, Become thou lord over thy brother;' and to Esau,
   Behold, I have made him thy lord [2304] .' Now though the word made'
   had implied Jacob's essence and the coming into being, even then it
   would not be right in them as much as to imagine the same of the Word
   of God, for the Son of God is no creature as Jacob was; besides, they
   might inquire and so rid themselves of that extravagance. But if they
   do not understand it of his essence nor of his coming into being,
   though Jacob was by nature creature and work, is not their madness
   worse than the Devil's [2305] , if what they dare not ascribe in
   consequence of a like phrase even to things by nature originate, that
   they attach to the Son of God, saying that He is a creature? For Isaac
   said Become' and I have made,' signifying neither the coming into being
   nor the essence of Jacob (for after thirty years and more from his
   birth he said this); but his authority over his brother, which came to
   pass subsequently.

   18. Much more then did Peter say this without meaning that the Essence
   of the Word was a work; for he knew Him to be God's Son, confessing,
   Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God [2306] ;' but he meant
   His Kingdom and Lordship which was formed and came to be according to
   grace, and was relatively to us. For while saying this, he was not
   silent about the Son of God's everlasting Godhead which is the
   Father's; but He had said already, that He had poured the Spirit on us;
   now to give the Spirit with authority, is not in the power of creature
   or work, but the Spirit is God's Gift [2307] . For the creatures are
   hallowed by the Holy Spirit; but the Son, in that He is not hallowed by
   the Spirit, but on the contrary Himself the Giver of it to all [2308] ,
   is therefore no creature, but true Son of the Father. And yet He who
   gives the Spirit, the same is said also to be made; that is, to be made
   among us Lord because of His manhood, while giving the Spirit because
   He is God's Word. For He ever was and is, as Son, so also Lord and
   Sovereign of all, being like in all things [2309] to the Father, and
   having all that is the Father's [2310] as He Himself has said [2311] .

   Chapter XVI.--Introductory to Proverbs viii. 22, that the Son is not a
   Creature. Arian formula, a creature but not as one of the creatures;
   but each creature is unlike all other creatures; and no creature can
   create. The Word then differs from all creatures in that in which they,
   though otherwise differing, all agree together, as creatures; viz. in
   being an efficient cause; in being the one medium or instrumental agent
   in creation; moreover in being the revealer of the Father; and in being
   the object of worship.

   18. (continued). Now in the next place let us consider the passage in
   the Proverbs, The Lord created me a beginning of His ways for His works
   [2312] ;' although in shewing that the Word is no work, it has been
   also shewn that He is no creature. For it is the same to say work or
   creature, so that the proof that He is no work is a proof also that He
   is no creature. Whereas one may marvel at these men, thus devising
   excuses to be irreligious, and nothing daunted at the refutations which
   meet them upon every point. For first they set about deceiving the
   simple by their questions, [2313] Did He who is make from that which
   was not one that was not or one that was [2314] ?' and, Had you a son
   before begetting him [2315] ?' And when this had been proved worthless,
   next they invented the question, Is the Unoriginate one or two [2316]
   ?' Then, when in this they had been confuted, straightway they formed
   another, Has He free-will and an alterable nature [2317] ?' But being
   forced to give up this, next they set about saying, Being made so much
   better than the Angels [2318] ;' and when the truth exposed this
   pretence, now again, collecting them all together, they think to
   recommend their heresy by work' and creature [2319] .' For they mean
   those very things over again, and are true to their own perverseness,
   putting into various shapes and turning to and fro the same errors, if
   so be to deceive some by that variousness. Although then abundant proof
   has been given above of this their reckless expedient, yet, since they
   make all places sound with this passage from the Proverbs, and to many
   who are ignorant of the faith of Christians, seem to say somewhat, it
   is necessary to examine separately, He created' as well as Who was
   faithful to Him that made Him [2320] ;' that, as in all others, so in
   this text also, they may be proved to have got no further than a
   fantasy.

   19. And first let us see the answers, which they returned to Alexander
   of blessed memory, in the outset, while their heresy was in course of
   formation. They wrote thus: He is a creature, but not as one of the
   creatures; a work, but not as one of the works; an offspring, but not
   as one of the offsprings [2321] .' Let every one consider the
   profligacy and craft of this heresy; for knowing the bitterness of its
   own malignity, it makes an effort to trick itself out with fair words,
   and says, what indeed it means, that He is a creature, yet thinks to be
   able to screen itself by adding, but not as one of the creatures.'
   However, in thus writing, they rather convict themselves of irreligion;
   for if, in your opinion, He is simply a creature, why add the pretence
   [2322] , but not as one of the creatures?' And if He is simply a work,
   how not as one of the works?' In which we may see the poison of the
   heresy. For by saying, offspring, but not as one of the offsprings,'
   they reckon many sons, and one of these they pronounce to be the Lord;
   so that according to them He is no more Only begotten, but one out of
   many brethren, and is called [2323] offspring and son. What use then is
   this pretence of saying that He is a creature and not a creature? for
   though ye shall say, Not as one of the creatures,' I will prove this
   sophism of yours to be foolish. For still ye pronounce Him to be one of
   the creatures; and whatever a man might say of the other creatures,
   such ye hold concerning the Son, ye truly fools and blind [2324] .' For
   is any one of the creatures just what another is [2325] , that ye
   should predicate this of the Son as some prerogative [2326] ? And all
   the visible creation was made in six days:--in the first, the light
   which He called day; in the second the firmament; in the third,
   gathering together the waters, He bared the dry land, and brought out
   the various fruits that are in it; and in the fourth, He made the sun
   and the moon and all the host of the stars; and on the fifth, He
   created the race of living things in the sea, and of birds in the air;
   and on the sixth, He made the quadrupeds on the earth, and at length
   man. And the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are
   clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made [2327] ;'
   and neither the light is as the night, nor the sun as the moon; nor the
   irrational as rational man; nor the Angels as the Thrones, nor the
   Thrones as the Authorities, yet they are all creatures, but each of the
   things made according to its kind exists and remains in its own
   essence, as it was made.

   20. Let the Word then be excepted from the works, and as Creator be
   restored to the Father, and be confessed to be Son by nature; or if
   simply He be a creature, then let Him be assigned the same condition as
   the rest one with another, and let them as well as He be said every one
   of them to be a creature but not as one of the creatures, offspring or
   work, but not as one of the works or offsprings.' For ye say that an
   offspring is the same as a work, writing generated or made [2328] .'
   For though the Son excel the rest on a comparison, still a creature He
   is nevertheless, as they are; since in those which are by nature
   creatures one may find some excelling others. Star, for instance,
   differs from star in glory, and the rest have all of them their mutual
   differences when compared together; yet it follows not for all this
   that some are lords, and others servants to the superior, nor that some
   are efficient causes [2329] , others by them come into being, but all
   have a nature which comes to be and is created, confessing in their own
   selves their Framer: as David says in the Psalms, The heavens declare
   the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth His handy work [2330] ;'
   and as Zorobabel the wise says, All the earth calleth upon the Truth,
   and the heaven blesseth it: all works shake and tremble at it [2331] .'
   But if the whole earth hymns the Framer and the Truth, and blesses, and
   fears it, and its Framer is the Word, and He Himself says, I am the
   Truth [2332] ,' it follows that the Word is not a creature, but alone
   proper to the Father, in whom all things are disposed, and He is
   celebrated by all, as Framer; for I was by Him disposing [2333] ;' and
   My Father worketh hitherto, and I work [2334] .' And the word hitherto'
   shews His eternal existence in the Father as the Word; for it is proper
   to the Word to work the Father's works and not to be external to Him.

   21. But if what the Father worketh, that the Son worketh also [2335] ,
   and what the Son createth, that is the creation of the Father, and yet
   the Son be the Father's work or creature, then either He will work His
   own self, and will be His own creator (since what the Father worketh is
   the Son's work also), which is absurd and impossible; or, in that He
   creates and worketh the things of the Father, He Himself is not a work
   nor a creature; for else being Himself an efficient cause [2336] , He
   may cause that to be in the case of things caused, which He Himself has
   become, or rather He may have no power to cause at all.

   For how, if, as you hold, He is come of nothing, is He able to frame
   things that are nothing into being? or if He, a creature, withal frames
   a creature, the same will be conceivable in the case of every creature,
   viz. the power to frame others. And if this pleases you, what is the
   need of the Word, seeing that things inferior can be brought to be by
   things superior? or at all events, every thing that is brought to be
   could have heard in the beginning God's words, Become' and be made,'
   and so would have been framed. But this is not so written, nor could it
   be. For none of things which are brought to be is an efficient cause,
   but all things were made through the Word: who would not have wrought
   all things, were He Himself in the number of the creatures. For neither
   would the Angels be able to frame, since they too are creatures, though
   Valentinus, and Marcion, and Basilides think so, and you are their
   copyists; nor will the sun, as being a creature, ever make what is not
   into what is; nor will man fashion man, nor stone devise stone, nor
   wood give growth to wood. But God is He who fashions man in the womb,
   and fixes the mountains, and makes wood grow; whereas man, as being
   capable of science, puts together and arranges that material, and works
   things that are, as he has learned; and is satisfied if they are but
   brought to be, and being conscious of what his nature is, if he needs
   aught, knows to ask [2337] it of God.

   22. If then God also wrought and compounded out of materials, this
   indeed is a gentile thought, according to which God is an artificer and
   not a Maker, but yet even in that case let the Word work the materials,
   at the bidding and in the service of God [2338] . But if He calls into
   existence things which existed not by His proper Word, then the Word is
   not in the number of things non-existing and called; or we have to seek
   another Word [2339] , through whom He too was called; for by the Word
   the things which were not have come to be. And if through Him He
   creates and makes, He is not Himself of things created and made; but
   rather He is the Word of the Creator God and is known from the Father's
   works which He Himself worketh, to be in the Father and the Father in
   Him,' and He that hath seen Him hath seen the Father [2340] ,' because
   the Son's Essence is proper to the Father, and He in all points like
   Him [2341] . How then does He create through Him, unless it be His Word
   and His Wisdom? and how can He be Word and Wisdom, unless He be the
   proper offspring of His Essence [2342] , and did not come to be, as
   others, out of nothing? And whereas all things are from nothing, and
   are creatures, and the Son, as they say, is one of the creatures too
   and of things which once were not, how does He alone reveal the Father,
   and none else but He know the Father? For could He, a work, possibly
   know the Father, then must the Father be also known by all according to
   the proportion of the measures of each: for all of them are works as He
   is. But if it be impossible for things originate either to see or to
   know, for the sight and the knowledge of Him surpasses all (since God
   Himself says, No one shall see My face and live [2343] '), yet the Son
   has declared, No one knoweth the Father, save the Son [2344] ,'
   therefore the Word is different from all things originate, in that He
   alone knows and alone sees the Father, as He says, Not that any one
   hath seen the Father, save He that is from the Father,' and no one
   knoweth the Father save the Son [2345] ,' though Arius think otherwise.
   How then did He alone know, except that He alone was proper to Him? and
   how proper, if He were a creature, and not a true Son from Him? (For
   one must not mind saying often the same thing for religion's sake.)
   Therefore it is irreligious to think that the Son is one of all things;
   and blasphemous and unmeaning to call Him a creature, but not as one of
   the creatures, and a work, but not as one of the works, an offspring,
   but not as one of the offsprings;' for how not as one of these, if, as
   they say, He was not before His generation [2346] ? for it is proper to
   the creatures and works not to be before their origination, and to
   subsist out of nothing, even though they excel other creatures in
   glory; for this difference of one with another will be found in all
   creatures, which appears in those which are visible [2347] .

   23. Moreover if, as the heretics hold, the Son were creature or work,
   but not as one of the creatures, because of His excelling them in
   glory, it were natural that Scripture should describe and display Him
   by a comparison in His favour with the other works; for instance, that
   it should say that He is greater than Archangels, and more honourable
   than the Thrones, and both brighter than sun and moon, and greater than
   the heavens. But he is not in fact thus referred to; but the Father
   shews Him to be His own proper and only Son, saying, Thou art My Son,'
   and This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. [2348] '
   Accordingly the Angels ministered unto Him, as being one beyond
   themselves; and they worship Him, not as being greater in glory, but as
   being some one beyond all the creatures, and beyond themselves, and
   alone the Father's proper Son according to essence [2349] . For if He
   was worshipped as excelling them in glory, each of things subservient
   ought to worship what excels itself. But this is not the case [2350] ;
   for creature does not worship creature, but servant Lord, and creature
   God. Thus Peter the Apostle hinders Cornelius who would worship him,
   saying, I myself also am a man [2351] .' And an Angel, when John would
   worship him in the Apocalypse, hinders him, saying, See thou do it not;
   for I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren the Prophets, and of
   them that keep the sayings of this book: worship God [2352] .'
   Therefore to God alone appertains worship, and this the very Angels
   know, that though they excel other beings in glory, yet they are all
   creatures and not to be worshipped [2353] , but worship the Lord. Thus
   Manoah, the father of Samson, wishing to offer sacrifice to the Angel,
   was thereupon hindered by him, saying, Offer not to me, but to God
   [2354] .' On the other hand, the Lord is worshipped even by the Angels;
   for it is written, Let all the Angels of God worship Him [2355] ;' and
   by all the Gentiles, as Isaiah says, The labour of Egypt and
   merchandize of Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come
   over unto thee, and they shall be thy servants;' and then, they shall
   fall down unto thee, and shall make supplication unto thee, saying,
   Surely God is in thee, and there is none else, there is no God [2356]
   .' And He accepts His disciples' worship, and certifies them who He is,
   saying, Call ye Me not Lord and Master? and ye say well, for so I am.'
   And when Thomas said to Him, My Lord and my God [2357] ,' He allows his
   words, or rather accepts him instead of hindering him. For He is, as
   the other Prophets declare, and David says in the Psalm, the Lord of
   hosts, the Lord of Sabaoth,' which is interpreted, the Lord of Armies,'
   and God True and Almighty, though the Arians burst [2358] at the
   tidings.

   24. But He had not been thus worshipped, nor been thus spoken of, were
   He a creature merely. But now since He is not a creature, but the
   proper offspring of the Essence of that God who is worshipped, and His
   Son by nature, therefore He is worshipped and is believed to be God,
   and is Lord of armies, and in authority, and Almighty, as the Father
   is; for He has said Himself, All things that the Father hath, are Mine
   [2359] .' For it is proper to the Son, to have the things of the
   Father, and to be such that the Father is seen in Him, and that through
   Him all things were made, and that the salvation of all comes to pass
   and consists in Him.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XVII.--Introduction to Proverbs viii. 22 continued. Absurdity
   of supposing a Son or Word created in order to the creation of other
   creatures; as to the creation being unable to bear God's immediate
   hand, God condescends to the lowest. Moreover, if the Son a creature,
   He too could not bear God's hand, and an infinite series of media will
   be necessary. Objected, that, as Moses who led out the Israelites was a
   man, so our Lord; but Moses was not the Agent in creation:--again, that
   unity is found in created ministrations, but all such ministrations are
   defective and dependent:--again, that He learned to create, yet could
   God's Wisdom need teaching? and why should He learn, if the Father
   worketh hitherto? If the Son was created to create us, He is for our
   sake, not we for His.

   24 (continued). And here it were well to ask them also this question
   [2360] , for a still clearer refutation of their heresy;--Wherefore,
   when all things are creatures, and all are brought into consistence
   from nothing, and the Son Himself, according to you, is creature and
   work, and once was not, wherefore has He made all things through Him'
   alone, and without Him was made not one thing [2361] ?' or why is it,
   when all things' are spoken of, that no one thinks the Son is signified
   in the number, but only things originate; whereas when Scripture speaks
   of the Word, it does not understand Him as being in the number of all,'
   but places Him with the Father, as Him in whom Providence and salvation
   for all' are wrought and effected by the Father, though all things
   surely might at the same command have come to be, at which He was
   brought into being by God alone? For God is not wearied by commanding
   [2362] , nor is His strength unequal to the making of all things, that
   He should alone create the only Son [2363] , and need His ministry and
   aid for the framing of the rest. For He lets nothing stand over, which
   He wills to be done; but He willed only [2364] , and all things
   subsisted, and no one hath resisted His will [2365] .' Why then were
   not all things brought into being by God alone at that same command, at
   which the Son came into being? Or let them tell us, why did all things
   through Him come to be, who was Himself but originate? How void of
   reason! however, they say concerning Him, that God willing to create
   originate nature, when He saw that it could not endure the untempered
   hand of the Father, and to be created by Him, makes and creates first
   and alone one only, and calls Him Son and Word, that, through Him as a
   medium, all things might thereupon be brought to be [2366] .' This they
   not only have said, but they have dared to put it into writing, namely,
   Eusebius, Arius, and Asterius who sacrificed [2367] .

   25. Is not this a full proof of that irreligion, with which they have
   drugged themselves with much madness, till they blush not to be
   intoxicate against the truth? For if they shall assign the toil of
   making all things as the reason why God made the Son only, the whole
   creation will cry out against them as saying unworthy things of God;
   and Isaiah too who has said in Scripture, The Everlasting God, the
   Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is
   weary: there is no searching of His understanding [2368] .' And if God
   made the Son alone, as not deigning to make the rest, but committed
   them to the Son as an assistant, this on the other hand is unworthy of
   God, for in Him there is no pride. Nay the Lord reproves the thought,
   when He says, Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing?' and one of
   them shall not fall on the ground without your Father which is in
   heaven.' And again, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat,
   nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than
   meat, and the body than raiment? Behold the fowls of the air, for they
   sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly
   Father feedeth them; are ye not much better than they? Which of you by
   taking thought, can add one cubit unto his stature? And why take ye
   thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow;
   they toil not, neither do they spin: and yet I say unto you, that even
   Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. Wherefore
   if God so clothe the grass of the field which to-day is, and to-morrow
   is cast into the oven, shall He not much more clothe you, O ye of
   little faith [2369] ?' If then it be not unworthy of God to exercise
   His Providence, even down to things so small, a hair of the head, and a
   sparrow, and the grass of the field, also it was not unworthy of Him to
   make them. For what things are the subjects of His Providence, of those
   He is Maker through His proper Word. Nay a worse absurdity lies before
   the men who thus speak; for they distinguish [2370] between the
   creatures and the framing; and consider the latter the work of the
   Father, the creatures the work of the Son; whereas either all things
   must be brought to be by the Father with the Son, or if all that is
   originate comes to be through the Son, we must not call Him one of the
   originated things.

   26. Next, their folly may be exposed thus:--if even the Word be of
   originated nature, how, whereas this nature is too feeble to be God's
   own handywork, could He alone of all endure to be made by the
   unoriginate and unmitigated Essence of God, as ye say? for it follows
   either that, if He could endure it, all could endure it, or, it being
   endurable by none, it was not endurable by the Word, for you say that
   He is one of originate things. And again, if because originate nature
   could not endure to be God's own handywork, there arose need of a
   mediator [2371] , it must follow, that, the Word being originate and a
   creature, there is need of medium in His framing also, since He too is
   of that originate nature which endures not to be made of God, but needs
   a medium. But if some being as a medium be found for Him, then again a
   fresh mediator is needed for that second, and thus tracing back and
   following out, we shall invent a vast crowd of accumulating mediators;
   and thus it will be impossible that the creation should subsist, as
   ever wanting a mediator, and that medium not coming into being without
   another mediator; for all of them will be of that originate nature
   which endures not to be made of God alone, as ye say. How abundant is
   that folly, which obliges them to hold that what has already come into
   being, admits not of coming! Or perhaps they opine that they have not
   even come to be, as still seeking their mediator; for, on the ground of
   their so irreligious and futile notion [2372] , what is would not have
   subsistence, for want of the medium.

   27. But again they allege this:--Behold, through Moses too did He lead
   the people from Egypt, and through him He gave the Law, yet he was a
   man; so that it is possible for like to be brought into being by like.'
   They should veil their face when they say this, to save their much
   shame. For Moses was not sent to frame the world, nor to call into
   being things which were not, or to fashion men like himself, but only
   to be the minister of words to the people, and to King Pharaoh. And
   this is a very different thing, for to minister is of things originate
   as of servants, but to frame and to create is of God alone, and of His
   proper Word and His Wisdom. Wherefore, in the matter of framing, we
   shall find none but God's Word; for all things are made in Wisdom,' and
   without the Word was made not one thing.' But as regards ministrations
   there are, not one only, but man out of their whole number, whomever
   the Lord will send. For there are many Archangels, many Thrones, and
   Authorities, and Dominions, thousands of thousands, and myriads of
   myriads, standing before Him [2373] , ministering and ready to be sent.
   And many Prophets, and twelve Apostles, and Paul. And Moses himself was
   not alone, but Aaron with him, and next other seventy were filled with
   the Holy Ghost. And Moses was succeeded by Joshua the son of Nun, and
   he by the Judges, and they not by one, but by a number of Kings. If
   then the Son were a creature and one of things originate, there must
   have been many such sons, that God might have many such ministers, just
   as there is a multitude of those others. But if this is not to be seen,
   but while the creatures are many, the Word is one, any one will collect
   from this, that the Son differs from all, and is not on a level with
   the creatures, but proper to the Father. Hence there are not many
   Words, but one only Word of the one Father, and one Image of the one
   God [2374] . But behold,' they say, there is one sun only [2375] , and
   one earth.' Let them maintain, senseless as they are, that there is one
   water and one fire, and then they may be told that everything that is
   brought to be, is one in its own essence; but for the ministry and
   service committed to it, by itself it is not adequate nor sufficient
   alone. For God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven, to
   give light upon the earth and to divide the day from the night; and let
   them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years.' And then he
   says, And God made two great lights, the greater light to rule the day,
   and the lesser light to rule the night: He made the stars also. And God
   set them in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth,
   and to rule over the day and over the night [2376] .'

   28. Behold there are many lights, and not the sun only, nor the moon
   only, but each is one in essence, and yet the service of all is one and
   common; and what each lacks, is supplied by the other, and the office
   of lighting is performed by all [2377] . Thus the sun has authority to
   shine throughout the day and no more; and the moon through the night;
   and the stars together with them accomplish the seasons and years, and
   become for signs, each according to the need that calls for it. Thus
   too the earth is not for all things, but for the fruits only, and to be
   a ground to tread on for the living things that inhabit it. And the
   firmament is to divide between waters and waters, and to be a place to
   set the stars in. So also fire and water, with other things, have been
   brought into being to be the constituent parts of bodies; and in short
   no one thing is alone, but all things that are made, as if members of
   each other, make up as it were one body, namely, the world. If then
   they thus conceive of the Son, let all men throw stones [2378] at them,
   considering the Word to be a part of this universe, and a part
   insufficient without the rest for the service committed to Him. But if
   this be manifestly irreligious, let them acknowledge that the Word is
   not in the number of things originate, but the sole and proper Word of
   the Father, and their Framer. But,' say they, though He is a creature
   and of things originate; yet as from a master and artificer has He
   [2379] learned to frame, and thus ministered [2380] to God who taught
   Him.' For thus the Sophist Asterius, on the strength of having learned
   to deny the Lord, has dared to write, not observing the absurdity which
   follows. For if framing be a thing to be taught, let them beware lest
   they say that God Himself be a Framer not by nature but by science, so
   as to admit of His losing the power. Besides, if the Wisdom of God
   attained to frame by teaching, how is He still Wisdom, when He needs to
   learn? and what was He before He learned? For it was not Wisdom, if it
   needed teaching; it was surely but some empty thing, and not essential
   Wisdom [2381] , but from advancement it had the name of Wisdom, and
   will be only so long Wisdom as it can keep what it has learned. For
   what has accrued not by any nature, but from learning, admits of being
   one time unlearned. But to speak thus of the Word of God, is not the
   part of Christians but of Greeks.

   29. For if the power of framing accrues to anyone from teaching, these
   insensate men are ascribing jealousy and weakness [2382] to
   God;--jealousy, in that He has not taught many how to frame, so that
   there may be around Him, as Archangels and Angels many, so framers
   many; and weakness, in that He could not make by Himself, but needed a
   fellow-worker, or under-worker; and that, though it has been already
   shewn that created nature admits of being made by God alone, since they
   consider the Son to be of such a nature and so made. But God is
   deficient in nothing: perish the thought! for He has said Himself, I am
   full [2383] .' Nor did the Word become Framer of all from teaching; but
   being the Image and Wisdom of the Father, He does the things of the
   Father. Nor hath He made the Son for the making of things created; for
   behold, though the Son exists, still [2384] the Father is seen to work,
   as the Lord Himself says, My Father worketh hitherto and I work [2385]
   .' If however, as you say, the Son came into being for the purpose of
   making the things after Him, and yet the Father is seen to work even
   after the Son, you must hold even in this light the making of such a
   Son to be superfluous. Besides, why, when He would create us, does He
   seek for a mediator at all, as if His will did not suffice to
   constitute whatever seemed good to Him? Yet the Scriptures say, He hath
   done whatsoever pleased Him [2386] ,' and Who hath resisted His will
   [2387] ?' And if His mere will [2388] is sufficient for the framing of
   all things, you make the office of a mediator superfluous; for your
   instance of Moses, and the sun and the moon has been shewn not to hold.
   And here again is an argument to silence you. You say that God, willing
   the creation of originated nature, and deliberating concerning it,
   designs and creates the Son, that through Him He may frame us; now, if
   so, consider how great an irreligion [2389] you have dared to utter.

   30. First, the Son appears rather to have been for us brought to be,
   than we for Him; for we were not created for Him, but He is made for us
   [2390] ; so that He owes thanks to us, not we to Him, as the woman to
   the man. For the man,' says Scripture, was not created for the woman,
   but the woman for the man.' Therefore, as the man is the image and
   glory of God, and the woman the glory of the man [2391] ,' so we are
   made God's image and to His glory; but the Son is our image, and exists
   for our glory. And we were brought into being that we might be; but
   God's Word was made, as you must hold, not that He might be [2392] ;
   but as an instrument [2393] for our need, so that not we from Him, but
   He is constituted from our need. Are not men who even conceive such
   thoughts, more than insensate? For if for us the Word was made, He has
   not precedence [2394] of us with God; for He did not take counsel about
   us having Him within Him, but having us in Himself, counselled, as they
   say, concerning His own Word. But if so, perchance the Father had not
   even a will for the Son at all; for not as having a will for Him, did
   He create Him, but with a will for us, He formed Him for our sake; for
   He designed Him after designing us; so that, according to these
   irreligious men, henceforth the Son, who was made as an instrument, is
   superfluous, now that they are made for whom He was created. But if the
   Son alone was made by God alone, because He could endure it, but we,
   because we could not, were made by the Word, why does He not first take
   counsel about the Word, who could endure His making, instead of taking
   counsel about us? or why does He not make more of Him who was strong,
   than of us who were weak? or why making Him first, does He not counsel
   about Him first? or why counselling about us first, does He not make us
   first, His will being sufficient for the constitution of all things?
   But He creates Him first, yet counsels first about us; and He wills us
   before the Mediator; and when He wills to create us, and counsels about
   us, He calls us creatures; but Him, whom He frames for us, He calls Son
   and proper Heir. But we, for whose sake He made Him, ought rather to be
   called sons; or certainly He, who is His Son, is rather the object of
   His previous thoughts and of His will, for whom He makes all us. Such
   the sickness, such the vomit [2395] of the heretics.

   Chapter XVIII.--Introduction to Proverbs viii. 22 continued. Contrast
   between the Father's operations immediately and naturally in the Son,
   instrumentally by the creatures; Scripture terms illustrative of this.
   Explanation of these illustrations; which should be interpreted by the
   doctrine of the Church; perverse sense put on them by the Arians,
   refuted. Mystery of Divine Generation. Contrast between God's Word and
   man's word drawn out at length. Asterius betrayed into holding two
   Unoriginates; his inconsistency. Baptism how by the Son as well as by
   the Father. On the Baptism of heretics. Why Arian worse than other
   heresies.

   31. But the sentiment of Truth [2396] in this matter must not be
   hidden, but must have high utterance. For the Word of God was not made
   for us, but rather we for Him, and in Him all things were created
   [2397] .' Nor for that we were weak, was He strong and made by the
   Father alone, that He might frame us by means of Him as an instrument;
   perish the thought! it is not so. For though it had seemed good to God
   not to make things originate, still had the Word been no less with God,
   and the Father in Him. At the same time, things originate could not
   without the Word be brought to be; hence they were made through
   Him,--and reasonably. For since the Word is the Son of God by nature
   proper to His essence, and is from Him, and in Him [2398] , as He said
   Himself, the creatures could not have come to be, except through Him.
   For as the light enlightens all things by its radiance, and without its
   radiance nothing would be illuminated, so also the Father, as by a hand
   [2399] , in the Word wrought all things, and without Him makes nothing.
   For instance, God said, as Moses relates, Let there be light,' and Let
   the waters be gathered together,' and let the dry land appear,' and Let
   Us make man [2400] ;' as also Holy David in the Psalm, He spake and
   they were made; He commanded and they were created [2401] .' And He
   spoke [2402] , not that, as in the case of men, some under-worker might
   hear, and learning the will of Him who spoke might go away and do it;
   for this is what is proper to creatures, but it is unseemly so to think
   or speak of the Word. For the Word of God is Framer and Maker, and He
   is the Father's Will [2403] . Hence it is that divine Scripture says
   not that one heard and answered, as to the manner or nature of the
   things which He wished made; but God only said, Let it become,' and he
   adds, And it became;' for what He thought good and counselled, that
   forthwith the Word began to do and to finish. For when God commands
   others, whether the Angels, or converses with Moses, or commands
   Abraham, then the hearer answers; and the one says, Whereby shall I
   know [2404] ?' and the other, Send some one else [2405] ;' and again,
   If they ask me, what is His Name, what shall I say to them [2406] ?'
   and the Angel said to Zacharias, Thus saith the Lord [2407] ;' and he
   asked the Lord, O Lord of hosts, how long wilt Thou not have mercy on
   Jerusalem?' and waits to hear good words and comfortable. For each of
   these has the Mediator [2408] Word, and the Wisdom of God which makes
   known the will of the Father. But when that Word Himself works and
   creates, then there is no questioning and answer, for the Father is in
   Him and the Word in the Father; but it suffices to will, and the work
   is done; so that the word He said' is a token of the will for our sake,
   and It was so,' denotes the work which is done through the Word and the
   Wisdom, in which Wisdom also is the Will of the Father. And God said'
   is explained in the Word,' for, he says, Thou hast made all things in
   Wisdom;' and By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made fast;' and
   There is one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by Him
   [2409] .'

   32. It is plain from this that the Arians are not fighting with us
   about their heresy; but while they pretend us, their real fight is
   against the Godhead Itself. For if the voice were ours which says, This
   it My Son [2410] ,' small were our complaint of them; but if it is the
   Father's voice, and the disciples heard it, and the Son too says of
   Himself, Before all the mountains He begat me [2411] ,' are they not
   fighting against God, as the giants [2412] in story, having their
   tongue, as the Psalmist says, a sharp sword [2413] for irreligion? For
   they neither feared the voice of the Father, nor reverenced the
   Saviour's words, nor trusted the Saints, one of whom writes, Who being
   the Brightness of His glory and the Expression of His subsistence,' and
   Christ the power of God and the Wisdom of God [2414] ;' and another
   says in the Psalm, With Thee is the well of life, and in Thy Light
   shall we see light,' and Thou madest all things in Wisdom [2415] ;' and
   the Prophets say, And the Word of the Lord came to me [2416] ;' and
   John, In the beginning was the Word;' and Luke, As they delivered them
   unto us which from the beginning were eye-witnesses and ministers of
   the Word [2417] ;' and as David again says, He sent His Word and healed
   them [2418] .' All these passages proscribe in every light the Arian
   heresy, and signify the eternity of the Word, and that He is not
   foreign but proper to the Father's Essence. For when saw any one light
   without radiance? or who dares to say that the expression can be
   different from the subsistence? or has not a man himself lost his mind
   [2419] who even entertains the thought that God was ever without Reason
   and without Wisdom? For such illustrations and such images has
   Scripture proposed, that, considering the inability of human nature to
   comprehend God, we might be able to form ideas even from these however
   poorly and dimly, and as far as is attainable [2420] . And as the
   creation contains abundant matter for the knowledge of the being of a
   God and a Providence (for by the greatness and beauty of the creatures
   proportionably the Maker of them is seen [2421] '), and we learn from
   them without asking for voices, but hearing the Scriptures we believe,
   and surveying the very order and the harmony of all things, we
   acknowledge that He is Maker and Lord and God of all, and apprehend His
   marvellous Providence and governance over all things; so in like manner
   about the Son's Godhead, what has been above said is sufficient, and it
   becomes superfluous, or rather it is very mad to dispute about it, or
   to ask in an heretical way, How can the Son be from eternity? or how
   can He be from the Father's Essence, yet not a part? since what is said
   to be of another, is a part of him; and what is divided, is not whole.

   33. These are the evil sophistries of the heterodox; yet, though we
   have already shewn their shallowness, the exact sense of these passages
   themselves and the force of these illustrations will serve to shew the
   baseless nature of their loathsome tenet. For we see that reason is
   ever, and is from him and proper to his essence, whose reason it is,
   and does not admit a before and an after. So again we see that the
   radiance from the sun is proper to it, and the sun's essence is not
   divided or impaired; but its essence is whole and its radiance perfect
   and whole [2422] , yet without impairing the essence of light, but as a
   true offspring from it. We understand in like manner that the Son is
   begotten not from without but from the Father, and while the Father
   remains whole, the Expression of His Subsistence is ever, and preserves
   the Father's likeness and unvarying Image, so that he who sees Him,
   sees in Him the Subsistence too, of which He is the Expression. And
   from the operation of the Expression we understand the true Godhead of
   the Subsistence, as the Saviour Himself teaches when He says, The
   Father who dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works [2423] ' which I do; and
   I and the Father are one,' and I in the Father and the Father in Me
   [2424] .' Therefore let this Christ--opposing heresy attempt first to
   divide [2425] the examples found in things originate, and say, Once the
   sun was without his radiance,' or, Radiance is not proper to the
   essence of light,' or It is indeed proper, but it is a part of light by
   division; and then let it divide Reason, and pronounce that it is
   foreign to mind, or that once it was not, or that it was not proper to
   its essence, or that it is by division a part of mind.' And so of His
   Expression and the Light and the Power, let it do violence to these as
   in the case of Reason and Radiance; and instead let it imagine what it
   will [2426] . But if such extravagance be impossible for them, are they
   not greatly beside themselves, presumptuously intruding into what is
   higher than things originate and their own nature, and essaying
   impossibilities [2427] ?

   34. For if in the case of these originate and irrational things
   offsprings are found which are not parts of the essences from which
   they are, nor subsist with passion, nor impair the essences of their
   originals, are they not mad again in seeking and conjecturing parts and
   passions in the instance of the immaterial and true God, and ascribing
   divisions to Him who is beyond passion and change, thereby to perplex
   the ears of the simple [2428] and to pervert them from the Truth? for
   who hears of a son but conceives of that which is proper to the
   father's essence? who heard, in his first catechising [2429] , that God
   has a Son and has made all things by His proper Word, but understood it
   in that sense in which we now mean it? who on the rise of this odious
   heresy of the Arians, was not at once startled at what he heard, as
   strange [2430] , and a second sowing, besides that Word which had been
   sown from the beginning? For what is sown in every soul from the
   beginning is that God has a Son, the Word, the Wisdom, the Power, that
   is, His Image and Radiance; from which it at once follows that He is
   always; that He is from the Father; that He is like; that He is the
   eternal offspring of His essence; and there is no idea involved in
   these of creature or work. But when the man who is an enemy, while men
   slept, made a second sowing [2431] , of He is a creature,' and There
   was once when He was not,' and How can it be?' thenceforth the wicked
   heresy of Christ's enemies rose as tares, and forthwith, as bereft of
   every right thought, they meddle [2432] like robbers, and venture to
   say, How can the Son always exist with the Father?' for men come of men
   and are sons, after a time; and the father is thirty years old, when
   the son begins to be, being begotten; and in short of every son of man,
   it is true that he was not before his generation. And again they
   whisper, How can the Son be Word, or the Word be God's Image? for the
   word of men is composed of syllables [2433] , and only signifies the
   speaker's will, and then is over [2434] and is lost.'

   35. They then afresh, as if forgetting the proofs which have been
   already urged against them, pierce themselves through [2435] ' with
   these bonds of irreligion, and thus argue. But the word of truth [2436]
   confutes them as follows:--if they were disputing concerning any man,
   then let them exercise reason in this human way, both concerning His
   Word and His Son; but if of God who created man, no longer let them
   entertain human thoughts, but others which are above human nature. For
   such as he that begets, such of necessity is the offspring; and such as
   is the Word's Father, such must be also His Word. Now man, begotten in
   time, in time [2437] also himself begets the child; and whereas from
   nothing he came to be, therefore his word [2438] also is over and
   continues not. But God is not as man, as Scripture has said; but is
   existing and is ever; therefore also His Word is existing [2439] and is
   everlastingly with the Father, as radiance of light. And man's word is
   composed of syllables, and neither lives nor operates anything, but is
   only significant of the speaker's intention, and does but go forth and
   go by, no more to appear, since it was not at all before it was spoken;
   wherefore the word of man neither lives nor operates anything, nor in
   short is man. And this happens to it, as I said before, because man who
   begets it, has his nature out of nothing. But God's Word is not merely
   pronounced, as one may say, nor a sound of accents, nor by His Son is
   meant His command [2440] ; but as radiance of light, so is He perfect
   offspring from perfect [2441] . Hence He is God also, as being God's
   Image; for the Word was God [2442] ' says Scripture. And man's words
   avail not for operation; hence man works not by means of words but of
   hands, for they have being, and man's word subsists not. But the Word
   of God,' as the Apostle says, is living and powerful and sharper than
   any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and
   spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the
   thoughts and intents of the heart. Neither is there any creature that
   is not manifest in His sight; but all things are naked and opened unto
   the eyes of Him with whom we have to do. [2443] ' He is then Framer of
   all, and without Him was made not one thing [2444] ,' nor can anything
   be made without Him.

   36. Nor must we ask why the Word of God is not such as our word,
   considering God is not such as we, as has been before said; nor again
   is it right to seek how the word is from God, or how He is God's
   radiance, or how God begets, and what is the manner of His begetting
   [2445] . For a man must be beside himself to venture on such points;
   since a thing ineffable and proper to God's nature, and known to Him
   alone and to the Son, this he demands to be explained in words. It is
   all one as if they sought where God is, and how God is, and of what
   nature the Father is. But as to ask such questions is irreligious, and
   argues an ignorance of God, so it is not holy to venture such questions
   concerning the generation of the Son of God, nor to measure God and His
   Wisdom by our own nature and infirmity. Nor is a person at liberty on
   that account to swerve in his thoughts from the truth, nor, if any one
   is perplexed in such inquiries, ought he to disbelieve what is written.
   For it is better in perplexity to be silent and believe, than to
   disbelieve on account of the perplexity: for he who is perplexed may in
   some way obtain mercy [2446] , because, though he has questioned, he
   has yet kept quiet; but when a man is led by his perplexity into
   forming for himself doctrines which beseem not, and utters what is
   unworthy of God, such daring recurs a sentence without mercy. For in
   such perplexities divine Scripture is able to afford him some relief,
   so as to take rightly what is written, and to dwell upon our word as an
   illustration; that as it is proper to us and is from us, and not a work
   external to us, so also God's Word is proper to Him and from Him, and
   is not a work; and yet is not like the word of man, or else we must
   suppose God to be man. For observe, many and various are men's words
   which pass away day by day; because those that come before others
   continue not, but vanish. Now this happens because their authors are
   men, and have seasons which pass away, and ideas which are successive;
   and what strikes them first and second, that they utter; so that they
   have many words, and yet after them all nothing at all remaining; for
   the speaker ceases, and his word forthwith is spent. But God's Word is
   one and the same, and, as it is written, The Word of God endureth for
   ever [2447] ,' not changed, not before or after other, but existing the
   same always. For it was fitting, whereas God is One, that His Image
   should be One also, and His Word One and One His Wisdom [2448] .

   37. Wherefore I am in wonder how, whereas God is One, these men
   introduce, after their private notions, many images and wisdoms and
   words [2449] , and say that the Father's proper and natural Word is
   other than the Son, by whom He even made the Son [2450] and that He who
   is really Son is but notionally [2451] called Word, as vine, and way,
   and door, and tree of life; and that He is called Wisdom also in name,
   the proper and true Wisdom of the Father, which coexist ingenerately
   [2452] with Him, being other than the Son, by which He even made the
   Son, and named Him Wisdom as partaking of it. This they have not
   confined to words, but Arius composed in his Thalia, and the Sophist
   Asterius wrote, what we have stated above, as follows: Blessed Paul
   said not that he preached Christ, the Power of God or the Wisdom of
   God,' but without the addition of the article, God's power' and God's
   wisdom [2453] ,' thus preaching that the proper Power of God Himself
   which is natural to Him, and co-existent in Him ingenerately, is
   something besides, generative indeed of Christ, and creative of the
   whole world, concerning which he teaches in his Epistle to the Romans
   thus,--The invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are
   clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His
   eternal Power and Godhead [2454] .' For as no one would say that the
   Godhead there mentioned was Christ, but the Father Himself, so, as I
   think, His eternal Power and Godhead also is not the Only Begotten Son,
   but the Father who begat Him [2455] .' And he teaches that there is
   another power and wisdom of God, manifested through Christ. And shortly
   after the same Asterius says, However His eternal power and wisdom,
   which truth argues to be without beginning and ingenerate, the same
   must surely be one. For there are many wisdoms which are one by one
   created by Him, of whom Christ is the first-born and only-begotten; all
   however equally depend on their Possessor. And all the powers are
   rightly called His who created and uses them:--as the Prophet says that
   the locust, which came to be a divine punishment of human sins, was
   called by God Himself not only a power, but a great power; and blessed
   David in most of the Psalms invites, not the Angels alone, but the
   Powers to praise God.'

   38. Now are they not worthy of all hatred for merely uttering this? for
   if, as they hold, He is Son, not because He is begotten of the Father
   and proper to His Essence, but that He is called Word only because of
   things rational [2456] , and Wisdom because of things gifted with
   wisdom, and Power because of things gifted with power, surely He must
   be named a Son because of those who are made sons: and perhaps because
   there are things existing, He has even His existence [2457] , in our
   notions only [2458] . And then after all what is He? for He is none of
   these Himself, if they are but His names [2459] : and He has but a
   semblance of being, and is decorated with these names from us. Rather
   this is some recklessness of the devil, or worse, if they are not
   unwilling that they should truly subsist themselves, but think that
   God's Word is but in name. Is not this portentous, to say that Wisdom
   coexists with the Father, yet not to say that this is the Christ, but
   that there are many created powers and wisdoms, of which one is the
   Lord whom they go on to compare to the caterpillar and locust? and are
   they not profligate, who, when they hear us say that the Word coexists
   with the Father, forthwith murmur out, Are you not speaking of two
   Unoriginates?' yet in speaking themselves of His Unoriginate Wisdom,'
   do not see that they have already incurred themselves the charge which
   they so rashly urge against us [2460] ? Moreover, what folly is there
   in that thought of theirs, that the Unoriginate Wisdom coexisting with
   God is God Himself! for what coexists does not coexist with itself, but
   with some one else, as the Evangelists say of the Lord, that He was
   together with His disciples; for He was not together with Himself, but
   with His disciples;--unless indeed they would say that God is of a
   compound nature, having wisdom a constituent or complement of His
   Essence, unoriginate as well as Himself [2461] , which moreover they
   pretend to be the framer of the world, that so they may deprive the Son
   of the framing of it. For there is nothing they would not maintain,
   sooner than hold the truth concerning the Lord.

   39. For where at all have they found in divine Scripture, or from whom
   have they heard, that there is another Word and another Wisdom besides
   this Son, that they should frame to themselves such a doctrine? True,
   indeed, it is written, Are not My words like fire, and like a hammer
   that breaketh the rock in pieces [2462] ?' and in the Proverbs, I will
   make known My words unto you [2463] ;' but these are precepts and
   commands, which God has spoken to the saints through His proper and
   only true Word, concerning which the Psalmist said, I have refrained my
   feet from every evil way, that I may keep Thy words [2464] .' Such
   words accordingly the Saviour signifies to be distinct from Himself,
   when He says in His own person, The words which I have spoken unto you
   [2465] .' For certainly such words are not offsprings or sons, nor are
   there so many words that frame the world, nor so many images of the One
   God, nor so many who have become men for us, nor as if from many such
   there were one who has become flesh, as John says; but as being the
   only Word of God was He preached by John, The Word was made flesh,' and
   all things were made by Him [2466] .' Wherefore of Him alone, our Lord
   Jesus Christ, and of His oneness with the Father, are written and set
   forth the testimonies, both of the Father signifying that the Son is
   One, and of the saints, aware of this and saying that the Word is One,
   and that He is Only-Begotten. And His works also are set forth; for all
   things, visible and invisible, have been brought to be through Him, and
   without Him was made not one thing [2467] .' But concerning another or
   any one else they have not a thought, nor frame to themselves words or
   wisdoms, of which neither name nor deed are signified by Scripture, but
   are named by these only. For it is their invention and Christ-opposing
   surmise, and they make the most [2468] of the name of the Word and the
   Wisdom; and framing to themselves others, they deny the true Word of
   God, and the real and only Wisdom of the Father, and thereby, miserable
   men, rival the Manichees. For they too, when they behold the works of
   God, deny Him the only and true God, and frame to themselves another,
   whom they can shew neither by work, nor in any testimony drawn from the
   divine oracles.

   40. Therefore, if neither in the divine oracles is found another wisdom
   besides this Son, nor from the fathers [2469] have we heard of any
   such, yet they have confessed and written of the Wisdom coexisting with
   the Father unoriginately, proper to Him, and the Framer of the world,
   this must be the Son who even according to them is eternally coexistent
   with the Father. For He is Framer of all, as it is written, In Wisdom
   hast Thou made them all [2470] .' Nay, Asterius himself, as if
   forgetting what he wrote before, afterwards, in Caiaphas's [2471]
   fashion, involuntarily, when urging the Greeks, instead of naming many
   wisdoms, or the caterpillar, confesses but one, in these words;--God
   the Word is one, but many are the things rational; and one is the
   essence and nature of Wisdom, but many are the things wise and
   beautiful.' And soon afterwards he says again:--Who are they whom they
   honour with the title of God's children? for they will not say that
   they too are words, nor maintain that there are many wisdoms. For it is
   not possible, whereas the Word is one, and Wisdom has been set forth as
   one, to dispense to the multitude of children the Essence of the Word,
   and to bestow on them the appellation of Wisdom.' It is not then at all
   wonderful, that the Arians should battle with the truth, when they have
   collisions with their own principles and conflict with each other, at
   one time saying that there are many wisdoms, at another maintaining
   one; at one time classing wisdom with the caterpillar, at another
   saying that it coexists with the Father and is proper to Him; now that
   the Father alone is unoriginate, and then again that His Wisdom and His
   Power are unoriginate also. And they battle with us for saying that the
   Word of God is ever, yet forget their own doctrines, and say themselves
   that Wisdom coexists with God unoriginately [2472] . So dizzied [2473]
   are they in all these matters, denying the true Wisdom, and inventing
   one which is not, as the Manichees who make to themselves another God,
   after denying Him that is.

   41. But let the other heresies and the Manichees also know that the
   Father of the Christ is One, and is Lord and Maker of the creation
   through His proper Word. And let the Ario-maniacs know in particular,
   that the Word of God is One, being the only Son proper and genuine from
   His Essence, and having with His Father the oneness of Godhead
   indivisible, as we said many times, being taught it by the Saviour
   Himself. Since, were it not so, wherefore through Him does the Father
   create, and in Him reveal Himself to whom He will, and illuminate them?
   or why too in the baptismal consecration is the Son named together with
   the Father? For if they say that the Father is not all-sufficient, then
   their answer is irreligious [2474] , but if He be, for this it is right
   to say, what is the need of the Son for framing the worlds, or for the
   holy laver? For what fellowship is there between creature and Creator?
   or why is a thing made classed with the Maker in the consecration of
   all of us? or why, as you hold, is faith in one Creator and in one
   creature delivered to us? for if it was that we might be joined to the
   Godhead, what need of the creature? but if that we might be united to
   the Son a creature, superfluous, according to you, is this naming of
   the Son in Baptism, for God who made Him a Son is able to make us sons
   also. Besides, if the Son be a creature, the nature of rational
   creatures being one, no help will come to creatures from a creature
   [2475] , since all [2476] need grace from God. We said a few words just
   now on the fitness that all things should be made by Him; but since the
   course of the discussion has led us also to mention holy Baptism, it is
   necessary to state, as I think and believe, that the Son is named with
   the Father, not as if the Father were not all-sufficient, not without
   meaning, and by accident; but, since He is God's Word and own Wisdom,
   and being His Radiance, is ever with the Father, therefore it is
   impossible, if the Father bestows grace, that He should not give it in
   the Son, for the Son is in the Father as the radiance in the light.
   For, not as if in need, but as a Father in His own Wisdom hath God
   founded the earth, and made all things in the Word which is from Him,
   and in the Son confirms the Holy Laver. For where the Father is, there
   is the Son, and where the light, there the radiance; and as what the
   Father worketh, He worketh through the Son [2477] , and the Lord
   Himself says, What I see the Father do, that do I also;' so also when
   baptism is given, whom the Father baptizes, him the Son baptizes; and
   whom the Son baptizes, he is consecrated in the Holy Ghost [2478] . And
   again as when the sun shines, one might say that the radiance
   illuminates, for the light is one and indivisible, nor can be detached,
   so where the Father is or is named, there plainly is the Son also; and
   is the Father named in Baptism? then must the Son be named with Him
   [2479] .

   42. Therefore, when He made His promise to the saints, He thus spoke; I
   and the Father will come, and make Our abode in him;' and again, that,
   as I and Thou are One, so they may be one in Us.' And the grace given
   is one, given from the Father in the Son, as Paul writes in every
   Epistle, Grace unto you, and peace from God our Father and the Lord
   Jesus Christ [2480] .' For the light must be with the ray, and the
   radiance must be contemplated together with its own light. Whence the
   Jews, as denying the Son as well as they, have not the Father either;
   for, as having left the Fountain of Wisdom [2481] ,' as Baruch
   reproaches them, they put from them the Wisdom springing from it, our
   Lord Jesus Christ (for Christ,' says the Apostle, is God's power and
   God's wisdom [2482] ),' when they said, We have no king but CÃ¦sar
   [2483] .' The Jews then have the penal award of their denial; for their
   city as well as their reasoning came to nought. And these too hazard
   the fulness of the mystery, I mean Baptism; for if the consecration is
   given to us into the Name of Father and Son, and they do not confess a
   true Father, because they deny what is from Him and like His Essence,
   and deny also the true Son, and name another of their own framing as
   created out of nothing, is not the rite administered by them altogether
   empty and unprofitable, making a show, but in reality being no help
   towards religion? For the Arians do not baptize into Father and Son,
   but into Creator and creature, and into Maker and work [2484] . And as
   a creature is other than the Son, so the Baptism, which is supposed to
   be given by them, is other than the truth, though they pretend to name
   the Name of the Father and the Son, because of the words of Scripture,
   For not he who simply says, O Lord,' gives Baptism; but he who with the
   Name has also the right faith [2485] . On this account therefore our
   Saviour also did not simply command to baptize, but first says, Teach;'
   then thus: Baptize into the Name of Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost;'
   that the right faith might follow upon learning, and together with
   faith might come the consecration of Baptism.

   43. There are many other heresies too, which use the words only, but
   not in a right sense, as I have said, nor with sound faith [2486] , and
   in consequence the water which they administer is unprofitable, as
   deficient in piety, so that he who is sprinkled [2487] by them is
   rather polluted [2488] by irreligion than redeemed. So Gentiles also,
   though the name of God is on their lips, incur the charge of Atheism
   [2489] , because they know not the real and very God, the Father of our
   Lord Jesus Christ. So Manichees and Phrygians [2490] , and the
   disciples of the Samosatene, though using the Names, nevertheless are
   heretics, and the Arians follow in the same course, though they read
   the words of Scripture, and use the Names, yet they too mock those who
   receive the rite from them, being more irreligious than the other
   heresies, and advancing beyond them, and making them seem innocent by
   their own recklessness of speech. For these other heresies lie against
   the truth in some certain respect, either erring concerning the Lord's
   Body, as if He did not take flesh of Mary, or as if He has not died at
   all, nor become man, but only appeared, and was not truly, and seemed
   to have a body when He had not, and seemed to have the shape of man, as
   visions in a dream; but the Arians are without disguise irreligious
   against the Father Himself. For hearing from the Scriptures that His
   Godhead is represented in the Son as in an image, they blaspheme,
   saying, that it is a creature, and everywhere concerning that Image,
   they carry about [2491] with them the phrase, He was not,' as mud in a
   wallet [2492] , and spit it forth as serpents [2493] their venom. Then,
   whereas their doctrine is nauseous to all men, forthwith, as a support
   against its fall, they prop up the heresy with human [2494] patronage,
   that the simple, at the sight or even by the fear may overlook the
   mischief of their perversity. Right indeed is it to pity their dupes;
   well is it to weep over them, for that they sacrifice their own
   interest for that immediate phantasy which pleasures furnish, and
   forfeit their future hope. In thinking to be baptized into the name of
   one who exists not, they will receive nothing; and ranking themselves
   with a creature, from the creation they will have no help, and
   believing in one unlike [2495] and foreign to the Father in essence, to
   the Father they will not be joined, not having His own Son by nature,
   who is from Him, who is in the Father, and in whom the Father is, as He
   Himself has said; but being led astray by them, the wretched men
   henceforth remain destitute and stripped of the Godhead. For this
   phantasy of earthly goods will not follow them upon their death; nor
   when they see the Lord whom they have denied, sitting on His Father's
   throne, and judging quick and dead, will they be able to call to their
   help any one of those who have now deceived them; for they shall see
   them also at the judgment-seat, repenting for their deeds of sin and
   irreligion.

   [2422] The Second Person in the Holy Trinity is not a quality of

   First Person, but whole or entire God; nor does the generation impair
   the Father's Substance, which is, antecedently to it, whole and entire
   God. Thus there are two Persons, in Each Other ineffably, Each being
   wholly one and the same Divine Substance, yet not being merely separate
   aspects of the Same, Each being God as absolutely as if there were no
   other Divine Person but Himself. Such a statement indeed is not only a
   contradiction in the terms used, but in our ideas, yet not therefore a

   [2457] Of course this line of thought consistently followed, leads to a
   kind of Pantheism; for what is the Supreme Being, according to it, but
   an ideal standard of perfection, the sum total of all that we see
   excellent in the world in the highest degree, a creation of our minds,
   without real objective existence? The true view of our Lord's titles,
   on the other hand, is that He is That properly and in perfection, of
   which in measure and degree the creatures partake from and in Him. Vid.
   supr. de Decr. 17, n. 5.

   [2458] kat' epinoian, in idea or notion. This is a phrase of very
   frequent occurrence, both in Athan. and other writers. We have found it
   already just above, and de Syn. 15. Or. i. 9, also Orat. iv. 2, 3. de
   Sent. D. 2, Ep. Ã†g 12, 13, 14. It denotes our idea or conception of a
   thing in contrast to the thing itself. Thus, the sun is to a savage a
   bright circle in the sky; a man is a rational animal,' according to a
   certain process of abstraction; a herb may be medicine upon one
   division, food in another; virtue may be called a mean; and faith is to
   one man an argumentative conclusion, to another a moral peculiarity,
   good or bad. In like manner, the Almighty is in reality most simple and
   uncompounded, without parts, passions, attributes, or properties; yet
   we speak of Him as good or holy, or as angry or pleased, denoting some
   particular aspect in which our infirmity views, in which also it can
   view, what is infinite and incomprehensible. That is, He is kat'
   epinoian holy or merciful, being in reality a Unity which is all
   mercifulness and also all holiness, not in the way of qualities but as
   one indivisible perfection; which is too great for us to conceive as It
   is.

   [2459] Â§19.

   [2460] The Anomoean in Max. Dial. i. a. urges against the Catholic
   that, if the Son exists in the Father, God is compound. Athan. here
   retorts that Asterius speaks of Wisdom as a really existing thing in
   the Divine Mind. Vid. next note.

   [2461] On this subject vid. Orat. iv. n. 2. Nothing is more remarkable
   than the confident tone in which Athan. accuses Arians as here, and
   [Marcellus] in Orat. iv. 2. of considering the Divine Nature as
   compound, as if the Catholics were in no respect open to such a charge.
   Nor are they; though in avoiding it, they are led to enunciate the most
   profound and ineffable mystery. Vid. supr. Â§33, n. 1. The Father is the
   One Simple Entire Divine Being, and so is the Son; They do in no sense
   share divinity between Them; Each is holos Theos. This is not ditheism
   or tritheism, for they are the same God; nor is it Sabellianism, for
   They are eternally distinct and substantive Persons; but it is a depth
   and height beyond our intellect, how what is Two in so full a sense can
   also in so full a sense be One, or how the Divine Nature does not come
   under number. vid. notes on Orat. iii. 27 and 36. Thus, being
   uncompounded in nature,' says Athan. He is Father of One Only Son.' de
   Decr. 11. In truth the distinction into Persons, as Petavius remarks,

   that the Son was created by and called after that Attribute; or 1. that
   Wisdom was ingenerate and eternal, 2. that there were created wisdoms,
   words, powers many, of which the Son was one.

   [2473] skotodiniosi, Orat. iii. 42. init.

   [2474] He says that it is contrary to all our notions of religion that
   Almighty God cannot create, enlighten, address, and unite Himself to
   His creatures immediately. This seems to be implied in saying that the
   Son was created for creation, illumination, &c.; whereas in the
   Catholic view the Son is but that Divine Person who in the Economy of
   grace is creator, enlightener, &c. God is represented all-perfect but

   Chapter XIX.--Texts explained; Sixthly, Proverbs viii. 22. Proverbs are
   of a figurative nature, and must be interpreted as such. We must
   interpret them, and in particular this passage, by the Regula Fidei. He
   created me' not equivalent to I am a creature.' Wisdom a creature so
   far forth as Its human body. Again, if He is a creature, it is as a
   beginning of ways,' an office which, though not an attribute, is a
   consequence, of a higher and divine nature. And it is for the works,'
   which implied the works existed, and therefore much more He, before He
   was created. Also the Lord' not the Father created' Him, which implies
   the creation was that of a servant.

   44. We have gone through thus much before the passage in the Proverbs,
   resisting the insensate fables which their hearts have invented, that
   they may know that the Son of God ought not to be called a creature,
   and may learn lightly to read what admits in truth of a right [2496]
   explanation. For it is written, The Lord created me a beginning of His
   ways, for His works [2497] ;' since, however, these are proverbs, and
   it is expressed in the way of proverbs, we must not expound them
   nakedly in their first sense, but we must inquire into the person, and
   thus religiously put the sense on it. For what is said in proverbs, is
   not said plainly, but is put forth latently [2498] , as the Lord
   Himself has taught us in the Gospel according to John, saying, These
   things have I spoken unto you in proverbs, but the time cometh when I
   shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but openly [2499] .'
   Therefore it is necessary to unfold the sense [2500] of what is said,
   and to seek it as something hidden, and not nakedly to expound as if
   the meaning were spoken plainly,' lest by a false interpretation we
   wander from the truth. If then what is written be about Angel, or any
   other of things originate, as concerning one of us who are works, let
   it be said, created me;' but if it be the Wisdom of God, in whom all
   things originate have been framed, that speaks concerning Itself, what
   ought we to understand but that He created' means nothing contrary to
   He begat?' Nor, as forgetting that It is Creator and Framer, or
   ignorant of the difference between the Creator and the creatures, does
   It number Itself among the creatures; but It signifies a certain sense,
   as in proverbs, not plainly,' but latent; which It inspired the saints
   to use in prophecy, while soon after It doth Itself give the meaning of
   He created' in other but parallel expressions, saying, Wisdom made
   herself a house [2501] .' Now it is plain that our body is Wisdom's
   house [2502] , which It took on Itself to become man; hence
   consistently does John say, The Word was made flesh [2503] ;' and by
   Solomon Wisdom says of Itself with cautious exactness [2504] , not I am
   a creature,' but only The Lord created me a beginning of His ways for
   His works [2505] ,' yet not created me that I might have being,' nor
   because I have a creature's beginning and origin.'

   45. For in this passage, not as signifying the Essence of His Godhead,
   nor His own everlasting and genuine generation from the Father, has the
   Word spoken by Solomon, but on the other hand His manhood and Economy
   towards us. And, as I said before, He has not said I am a creature,' or
   I became a creature,' but only He created [2506] .' For the creatures,
   having a created essence, are originate, and are said to be created,
   and of course the creature is created: but this mere term He created'
   does not necessarily signify the essence or the generation, but
   indicates something else as coming to pass in Him of whom it speaks,
   and not simply that He who is said to be created, is at once in His
   Nature and Essence a creature [2507] . And this difference divine
   Scripture recognises, saying concerning the creatures, The earth is
   full of Thy creation,' and the creation itself groaneth together and
   travaileth together [2508] ;' and in the Apocalypse it says, And the
   third part of the creatures in the sea died which had life;' as also
   Paul says, Every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be refused
   if it be received with thanksgiving [2509] ;' and in the book of Wisdom
   it is written, Having ordained man through Thy wisdom, that he should
   have dominion over the creatures which Thou hast made [2510] .' And
   these, being creatures, are also said to be created, as we may further
   hear from the Lord, who says, He who created them, made them male and
   female [2511] ;' and from Moses in the Song, who writes, Ask now of the
   days that are past, which were before thee since the day that God
   created man upon the earth, and from the one side of heaven unto the
   other [2512] .' And Paul in Colossians, Who is the Image of the
   Invisible God, the Firstborn of every creature, for in Him were all
   things created that are in heaven, and that are on earth, visible and
   invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or
   powers; all things were created through Him, and for Him, and He is
   before all [2513] .'

   46. That to be called creatures, then, and to be created belongs to
   things which have by nature a created essence, these passages are
   sufficient to remind us, though Scripture is full of the like; on the
   other hand that the single word He created' does not simply denote the
   essence and mode of generation, David shews in the Psalm, This shall be
   written for another generation, and the people that is created shall
   praise the Lord [2514] ;' and again, Create in me a clean heart, O God
   [2515] ;' and Paul in Ephesians says, Having abolished the law of
   commandments contained in ordinances, for to create in Himself of two
   one new man [2516] ;' and again, Put ye on the new man, which after God
   is created in righteousness and true holiness [2517] .' For neither
   David spoke of any people created in essence, nor prayed to have
   another heart than that he had, but meant renovation according to God
   and renewal; nor did Paul signify two persons created in essence in the
   Lord, nor again did he counsel us to put on any other man; but he
   called the life according to virtue the man after God,' and by the
   created' in Christ he meant the two people who are renewed in Him. Such
   too is the language of the book of Jeremiah; The Lord created a new
   salvation for a planting, in which salvation men shall walk to and fro
   [2518] ;' and in thus speaking, he does not mean any essence of a
   creature, but prophesies of the renewal of salvation among men, which
   has taken place in Christ for us. Such then being the difference
   between the creatures' and the single word He created,' if you find
   anywhere in divine Scripture the Lord called creature,' produce it and
   fight; but if it is nowhere written that He is a creature, only He
   Himself says about Himself in the Proverbs, The Lord created me,' shame
   upon you, both on the ground of the distinction aforesaid and for that
   the diction is like that of proverbs; and accordingly let He created'
   be understood, not of His being a creature, but of that human nature
   which became His, for to this belongs creation. Indeed is it not
   evidently unfair in you, when David and Paul say He created,' then
   indeed not to understand it of the essence and the generation, but the
   renewal; yet, when the Lord says He created' to number His essence with
   the creatures? and again when Scripture says, Wisdom built her an
   house, she set it upon seven pillars [2519] ,' to understand house'
   allegorically, but to take He created' as it stands, and to fasten on
   it the idea of creature? and neither His being Framer of all has had
   any weight with you, nor have you feared His being the sole and proper
   Offspring of the Father, but recklessly, as if you had enlisted against
   Him, do ye fight, and think less of Him than of men.

   47. For the very passage proves that it is only an invention of your
   own to call the Lord creature. For the Lord, knowing His own Essence to
   be the Only-begotten Wisdom and Offspring of the Father, and other than
   things originate and natural creatures, says in love to man, The Lord
   created me a beginning of His ways,' as if to say, My Father hath
   prepared for Me a body, and has created Me for men in behalf of their
   salvation.' For, as when John says, The Word was made flesh [2520] ,'
   we do not conceive the whole Word Himself to be flesh [2521] , but to
   have put on flesh and become man, and on hearing, Christ hath become a
   curse for us,' and He hath made Him sin for us who knew no sin [2522]
   ,' we do not simply conceive this, that whole Christ has become curse
   and sin, but that He has taken on Him the curse which lay against us
   (as the Apostle has said, Has redeemed us from the curse,' and has
   carried,' as Isaiah has said, our sins,' and as Peter has written, has
   borne them in the body on the wood [2523] '); so, if it is said in the
   Proverbs He created,' we must not conceive that the whole Word is in
   nature a creature, but that He put on the created body [2524] and that
   God created Him for our sakes, preparing for Him the created body, as
   it is written, for us, that in Him we might be capable of being renewed
   and deified. What then deceived you, O senseless, to call the Creator a
   creature? or whence did you purchase for you this new thought, to
   parade it [2525] ? For the Proverbs say He created,' but they call not
   the Son creature, but Offspring; and, according to the distinction in
   Scripture aforesaid of He created' and creature,' they acknowledge,
   what is by nature proper to the Son, that He is the Only-begotten
   Wisdom and Framer of the creatures, and when they say He created,' they
   say it not in respect of His Essence, but signify that He was becoming
   a beginning of many ways; so that He created' is in contrast to
   Offspring,' and His being called the Beginning of ways [2526] ' to His
   being the Only-begotten Word.

   48. For if He is Offspring, how call ye Him creature? for no one says
   that He begets what He creates, nor calls His proper offspring
   creatures; and again, if He is Only-begotten, how becomes He beginning
   of the ways?' for of necessity, if He was created a beginning of all
   things, He is no longer alone, as having those who came into being
   after Him. For Reuben, when he became a beginning of the children
   [2527] , was not only-begotten, but in time indeed first, but in nature
   and relationship one among those who came after him. Therefore if the
   Word also is a beginning of the ways,' He must be such as the ways are,
   and the ways must be such as the Word, though in point of time He be
   created first of them. For the beginning or initiative of a city is
   such as the other parts of the city are, and the members too being
   joined to it, make the city whole and one, as the many members of one
   body; nor does one part of it make, and another come to be, and is
   subject to the former, but all the city equally has its government and
   constitution from its maker. If then the Lord is in such sense created
   as a beginning' of all things, it would follow that He and all other
   things together make up the unity of the creation, and He neither
   differs from all others, though He become the beginning' of all, nor is
   He Lord of them, though older in point of time; but He has the same
   manner of framing and the same Lord as the rest. Nay, if He be a
   creature, as you hold, how can He be created sole and first at all, so
   as to be beginning of all? when it is plain from what has been said,
   that among the creatures not any is of a constant [2528] nature and of
   prior formation, but each has its origination with all the rest,
   however it may excel others in glory. For as to the separate stars or
   the great lights, not this appeared first, and that second, but in one
   day and by the same command, they were all called into being. And such
   was the original formation of the quadrupeds, and of birds, and fishes,
   and cattle, and plants; thus too has the race made after God's Image
   come to be, namely men; for though Adam only was formed out of earth,
   yet in him was involved the succession of the whole race.

   49. And from the visible creation, we clearly discern that His
   invisible things also, being perceived by the things that are made
   [2529] ,' are not independent of each other; for it was not first one
   and then another, but all at once were constituted after their kind.
   For the Apostle did not number individually, so as to say whether
   Angel, or Throne, or Dominion, or Authority,' but he mentions together
   all according to their kind, whether Angels, or Archangels, or
   Principalities [2530] :' for in this way is the origination of the
   creatures. If then, as I have said, the Word were creature He must have
   been brought into being, not first of them, but with all the other
   Powers, though in glory He excel the rest ever so much. For so we find
   it to be in their case, that at once they came to be, with neither
   first nor second, and they differ from each other in glory, some on the
   right of the throne, some all around, and some on the left, but one and
   all praising and standing in service before the Lord [2531] . Therefore
   if the Word be creature He would not be first or beginning of the rest;
   yet if He be before all, as indeed He is, and is Himself alone First
   and Son, it does not follow that He is beginning of all things as to
   His Essence [2532] , for what is the beginning of all is in the number
   of all. And if He is not such a beginning, then neither is He a
   creature, but it is very plain that He differs in essence and nature
   from the creatures, and is other than they, and is Likeness and Image
   of the sole and true God, being Himself sole also. Hence He is not
   classed with creatures in Scripture, but David rebukes those who dare
   even to think of Him as such, saying, Who among the gods is like unto
   the Lord [2533] ?' and Who is like unto the Lord among the sons of
   God?' and Baruch, This is our God, and another shall not be reckoned
   with Him [2534] .' For the One creates, and the rest are created; and
   the One is the own Word and Wisdom of the Father's Essence, and through
   this Word things which came to be, which before existed not, were made.

   50. Your famous assertion then, that the Son is a creature, is not
   true, but is your fantasy only; nay Solomon convicts you of having many
   times slandered him. For he has not called Him creature, but God's
   Offspring and Wisdom, saying, God in Wisdom established the earth,' and
   Wisdom built her an house [2535] .' And the very passage in question
   proves your irreligious spirit; for it is written, The Lord created me
   a beginning of His ways for His works.' Therefore if He is before all
   things, yet says He created me' (not that I might make the works,' but)
   for the works,' unless He created' relates to something later than
   Himself, He will seem later than the works, finding them on His
   creation already in existence before Him, for the sake of which He is
   also brought into being. And if so, how is He before all things
   notwithstanding? and how were all things made through Him and consist
   in Him? for behold, you say that the works consisted before Him, for
   which He is created and sent. But it is not so; perish the thought!
   false is the supposition of the heretics. For the Word of God is not
   creature but Creator; and says in the manner of proverbs, He created
   me' when He put on created flesh. And something besides may be
   understood from the passage itself; for, being Son and having God for
   His Father, for He is His proper Offspring, yet here He names the
   Father Lord; not that He was servant, but because He took the servant's
   form. For it became Him, on the one hand being the Word from the
   Father, to call God Father: for this is proper to son towards father;
   on the other, having come to finish the work, and taken a servant's
   form, to name the Father Lord. And this difference He Himself has
   taught by an apt distinction, saying in the Gospels, I thank Thee, O
   Father,' and then, Lord of heaven and earth [2536] .' For He calls God
   His Father, but of the creatures He names Him Lord; as shewing clearly
   from these words, that, when He put on the creature [2537] , then it
   was He called the Father Lord. For in the prayer of David the Holy
   Spirit marks the same distinction, saying in the Psalms, Give Thy
   strength unto Thy Child, and help the Son of Thine handmaid [2538] .'
   For the natural and true child of God is one, and the sons of the
   handmaid, that is, of the nature of things originate, are other.
   Wherefore the One, as Son, has the Father's might; but the rest are in
   need of salvation.

   51. (But if, because He was called child, they idly talk, let them know
   that both Isaac was named Abraham's child, and the son of the Shunamite
   was called young child.) Reasonably then, we being servants, when He
   became as we, He too calls the Father Lord, as we do; and this He has
   so done from love to man, that we too, being servants by nature, and
   receiving the Spirit of the Son, might have confidence to call Him by
   grace Father, who is by nature our Lord. But as we, in calling the Lord
   Father, do not deny our servitude by nature (for we are His works, and
   it is He that hath made us, and not we ourselves [2539] '), so when the
   Son, on taking the servant's form, says, The Lord created me a
   beginning of His ways,' let them not deny the eternity of His Godhead,
   and that in the beginning was the Word,' and all things were made by
   Him,' and in Him all things were created [2540] .'

   [2506] He seems here to say that it is both true that The Lord
   created,' and yet that the Son was not created. Creatures alone are
   created, and He was not a creature. Rather something belonging or
   relating to Him, something short of His substance or nature, was
   created. However, it is a question in controversy whether even His
   Manhood can be called a creature, though many of the Fathers (including
   Athan. in several places) seem so to call it. On the whole it would
   appear, (1.) that if creature,' like Son,' be a personal term, He is
   not a creature; but if it be a word of nature, He is a creature; (2.)
   that our Lord is a creature in respect to the flesh (vid. infr. 47);
   (3.) that since the flesh is infinitely beneath His divinity, it is
   neither natural nor safe to call Him a creature (cf. Thom. Aq. Sum. Th.
   iii. xvi. 8, non dicimus, quod Ã†thiops est albus, sed quod est albus
   secundum dentes') and (4.) that, if the flesh is worshipped, still it
   is worshipped as in the Person of the Son, not by a separate act of
   worship. Cf. infr. Letter 60. ad Adelph. 3. Epiph. has imitated this
   passage, Ancor. 51. introducing the illustration of a king and his
   robe, &c.

   [2507] to legomenon ktizesthai te phusei kai te ousi& 139; ktisma. also
   infr. 60. Without meaning that the respective terms are synonymous, is
   it not plain that in a later phraseology this would have been, not
   simply that He is in His Person a creature,' or that His Person is
   created?' Athan.'s use of the phrase ousia tou logou has already been
   noticed, supr. i. 45, and passages from this Oration are given in
   another connexion, supr. p. 70, note 15. The term is synonymous with
   the Divine Nature as existing in the Person of the Word. [Cf. Prolegg.
   ch. ii. Â§3 (2) b.] In the passage in the text the ousia of the Word is
   contrasted to the ousia of creatures; and it is observable that it is
   implied that our Lord has not taken on Him a created ousia. He said
   not, Athan. remarks, I became a creature, for the creatures have a
   created essence;' he adds that He created' signifies, not essence, but
   something taking place in Him peri ekeinon, i.e. some adjunct or
   accident (e.g. notes on de Decr. 22), or as he says supr. Â§8,
   envelopment or dress. And infr. Â§51, he contrasts the ousia and the
   anthropinon of the Word; as in Orat. i. 41. ousia and he anthropotes;

   He speaks of the Son taking on Him the economy,' infr. 76, and of the

   observed, Â§8, note, how this line of teaching might be wrested to the
   purposes of the Apollinarian and Eutychian heresies; and, considering
   Athan.'s most emphatic protests against their errors in his later
   works, as well as his strong statements in Orat. iii. there is no
   hazard in this admission. His ordinary use of anthropos for the manhood
   might quite as plausibly be perverted on the other hand into a defence
   of Nestorianism. Vid. also the Ed. Ben. on S. Hilary, prÃ¦f. p. xliii.

   [2524] Here he says that, though our Lord's flesh is created or He is
   created as to the flesh, it is not right to call Him a creature. This
   is very much what S. Thomas says, as referred to in Â§45, note 1, in the
   words of the Schools, that Ã†thiops, albus secundum dentes, non est
   albus. But why may not our Lord be so called upon the principle of the
   communicatio Idiomatum (infr. note on iii. 31.) as He is said to be
   born of a Virgin, to have suffered, &c.? The reason is this:--birth,
   passion, &c., confessedly belong to His human nature, without adding
   according to the flesh;' but creature' not implying humanity, might
   appear a simple attribute of His Person, if used without limitation.
   Thus, as S. Thomas adds, though we may not absolutely say Ã†thiops est
   albus, we may say crispus est,' or in like manner, calvus est.' Since
   crispus, or calvus, can but refer to the hair. Still more does this
   remark apply in the case of Sonship,' which is a personal attribute
   altogether; as is proved, says Petav. de Incarn. vii. 6 fin. by the
   instance of Adam, who was in all respects a man like Seth, yet not a
   son. Accordingly, we may not call our Lord, even according to the
   manhood, an adopted Son.

   was a creature, yet still that such a title belongs not to His essence.
   It is the name of an office which the Eternal Word alone can fill. His
   Divine Sonship is both superior and necessary to that office of a
   Beginning.' Hence it is both true (as he says) that if the Word is a
   creature, He is not a beginning;' and yet that that beginning' is in
   the number of the creatures.' Though He becomes the beginning,' He is
   not a beginning as to His essence,' vid. supr. i. 49, and infr. Â§60.

   Chapter XX.--Texts Explained; Sixthly, Proverbs viii. 22 Continued. Our
   Lord is said to be created for the works,' i.e. with a particular
   purpose, which no mere creatures are ever said to be. Parallel of Isai.
   xlix. 5, &c. When His manhood is spoken of, a reason for it is added;
   not so when His Divine Nature; Texts in proof.

   51 (continued). For the passage in the Proverbs, as I have said before,
   signifies, not the Essence, but the manhood of the Word; for if He says
   that He was created for the works,' He shews His intention of
   signifying, not His Essence, but the Economy which took place for His
   works,' which comes second to being. For things which are in formation
   and creation are made specially that they may be and exist [2541] , and
   next they have to do whatever the Word bids them, as may be seen in the
   case of all things. For Adam was created, not that He might work, but
   that first he might be man; for it was after this that he received the
   command to work. And Noah was created, not because of the ark, but that
   first he might exist and be a man; for after this he received
   commandment to prepare the ark. And the like will be found in every
   case on inquiring into it;--thus the great Moses first was made a man,
   and next was entrusted with the government of the people. Therefore
   here too we must suppose the like; for thou seest, that the Word is not
   created into existence, but, In the beginning was the Word,' and He is
   afterwards sent for the works' and the Economy towards them. For before
   the works were made, the Son was ever, nor was there yet need that He
   should be created; but when the works were created and need arose
   afterwards of the Economy for their restoration, then it was that the
   Word took upon Himself this condescension and assimilation to the
   works; which He has shewn us by the word He created.' And through the
   Prophet Isaiah willing to signify the like, He says again: And now thus
   saith the Lord, who formed me from the womb to be His servant, to
   gather together Jacob unto Him and Israel, I shall be brought together
   and be glorified before the Lord [2542] .'

   52. See here too, He is formed, not into existence, but in order to
   gather together the tribes, which were in existence before He was
   formed. For as in the former passage stands He created,' so in this He
   formed;' and as there for the works,' so here to gather together;' so
   that in every point of view it appears that He created' and He formed'
   are said after the Word was.' For as before His forming the tribes
   existed, for whose sake He was formed, so does it appear that the works
   exist, for which He was created. And when in the beginning was the
   Word,' not yet were the works, as I have said before; but when the
   works were made and the need required, then He created' was said; and
   as if some son, when the servants were lost, and in the hands of the
   enemy by their own carelessness, and need was urgent, were sent by his
   father to succour and recover them, and on setting out were to put over
   him the like dress [2543] with them, and should fashion himself as
   they, lest the capturers, recognising him [2544] as the master, should
   take to flight and prevent his descending to those who were hidden
   under the earth by them; and then were any one to inquire of him, why
   he did so, were to make answer, My Father thus formed and prepared me
   for his works,' while in thus speaking, he neither implies that he is a
   servant nor one of the works, nor speaks of the beginning of His
   origination, but of the subsequent charge given him over the works,--in
   the same way the Lord also, having put over Him our flesh, and being
   found in fashion as a man,' if He were questioned by those who saw Him
   thus and marvelled, would say, The Lord created Me the beginning of His
   ways for His works,' and He formed Me to gather together Israel.' This
   again the Spirit [2545] foretells in the Psalms, saying, Thou didst set
   Him over the works of Thine hands [2546] ;' which elsewhere the Lord
   signified of Himself, I am set as King by Him upon His holy hill of
   Sion [2547] .' And as, when He shone [2548] in the body upon Sion, He
   had not His beginning of existence or of reign, but being God's Word
   and everlasting King, He vouchsafed that His kingdom should shine in a
   human way in Sion, that redeeming them and us from the sin which
   reigned in them, He might bring them under His Father's Kingdom, so, on
   being set for the works,' He is not set for things which did not yet
   exist, but for such as already were and needed restoration.

   53. He created' then and He formed' and He set,' having the same
   meaning, do not denote the beginning of His being, or of His essence as
   created, but His beneficent renovation which came to pass for us.
   Accordingly, though He thus speaks, yet He taught also that He Himself
   existed before this, when He said, Before Abraham came to be, I am
   [2549] ;' and when He prepared the heavens, I was present with Him;'
   and I was with Him disposing things [2550] .' And as He Himself was
   before Abraham came to be, and Israel had come into being after
   Abraham, and plainly He exists first and is formed afterwards, and His
   forming signifies not His beginning of being but His taking manhood,
   wherein also He collects together the tribes of Israel; so, as being
   always with the Father,' He Himself is Framer of the creation, and His
   works are evidently later than Himself, and He created' signifies, not
   His beginning of being, but the Economy which took place for the works,
   which He effected in the flesh. For it became Him, being other than the
   works, nay rather their Framer, to take upon Himself their renovation
   [2551] , that, whereas He is created for us, all things may be now
   created in Him. For when He said He created,' He forthwith added the
   reason, naming the works,' that His creation for the works might
   signify His becoming man for their renovation. And this is usual with
   divine Scripture [2552] ; for when it signifies the fleshly origination
   of the Son, it adds also the cause [2553] for which He became man; but
   when he speaks or His servants declare anything of His Godhead, all is
   said in simple diction, and with an absolute sense, and without reason
   being added. For He is the Father's Radiance; and as the Father is, but
   not for any reason, neither must we seek the reason of that Radiance.
   Thus it is written, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was
   with God, and the Word was God [2554] ;' and the wherefore it assigns
   not [2555] ; but when the Word was made flesh [2556] ,' then it adds
   the reason why, saying, And dwelt among us.' And again the Apostle
   saying, Who being in the form of God,' has not introduced the reason,
   till He took on Him the form of a servant;' for then he continues, He
   humbled Himself unto death, even the death of the cross [2557] ;' for
   it was for this that He both became flesh and took the form of a
   servant.

   54. And the Lord Himself has spoken many things in proverbs; but when
   giving us notices about Himself, He has spoken absolutely [2558] ; I in
   the Father and the Father in Me,' and I and the Father are one,' and,
   He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father,' and I am the Light of the
   world,' and, I am the Truth [2559] ;' not setting down in every case
   the reason, nor the wherefore, lest He should seem second to those
   things for which He was made. For that reason would needs take
   precedence of Him, without which not even He Himself had come into
   being. Paul, for instance, separated an Apostle for the Gospel, which
   the Lord had promised afore by the Prophets [2560] ,' was thereby made
   subordinate to the Gospel, of which he was made minister, and John,
   being chosen to prepare the Lord's way, was made subordinate to the
   Lord; but the Lord, not being made subordinate to any reason why He
   should be Word, save only that He is the Father's Offspring and
   Only-begotten Wisdom, when He becomes man, then assigns the reason why
   He is about to take flesh. For the need of man preceded His becoming
   man, apart from which He had not put on flesh [2561] . And what the
   need was for which He became man, He Himself thus signifies, I came
   down from heaven, not to do Mine own will, but the will of Him that
   sent Me. And this is the will of Him which hath sent Me, that of all
   which He hath given Me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up
   again at the last day. And this is the will of My Father, that every
   one which seeth the Son and believeth on Him may have everlasting life,
   and I will raise him up at the last day [2562] .' And again; I am come
   a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on Me, should not
   abide in darkness [2563] .' And again he says; To this end was I born,
   and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness
   unto the truth [2564] .' And John has written: For this was manifested
   the Son of God, that He might destroy the works of the devil [2565] .'

   55. To give a witness then, and for our sakes to undergo death, to
   raise man up and destroy the works of the devil [2566] , the Saviour
   came, and this is the reason of His incarnate presence. For otherwise a
   resurrection had not been, unless there had been death; and how had
   death been, unless He had had a mortal body? This the Apostle, learning
   from Him, thus sets forth, Forasmuch then as the children are partakers
   of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same;
   that through death He might bring to nought him that had the power of
   death, that is, the devil, and deliver them who through fear of death
   were all their lifetime subject to bondage [2567] .' And, Since by man
   came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead [2568] .' And
   again, For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the
   flesh, God, sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and
   for sin, condemned sin in the flesh; that the ordinance of the Law
   might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh but after the
   Spirit [2569] .' And John says, For God sent not His Son into the world
   to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved
   [2570] .' And again, the Saviour has spoken in His own person, For
   judgment am I come into this world, that they who see not might see,
   and that they which see might become blind [2571] .' Not for Himself
   then, but for our salvation, and to abolish death, and to condemn sin,
   and to give sight to the blind, and to raise up all from the dead, has
   He come; but if not for Himself, but for us, by consequence not for
   Himself but for us is He created. But if not for Himself is He created,
   but for us, then He is not Himself a creature, but, as having put on
   our flesh, He uses such language. And that this is the sense of the
   Scriptures, we may learn from the Apostle, who says in Ephesians,
   Having broken down the middle wall of partition between us, having
   abolished in His flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments
   contained in ordinances, to create in Himself of twain one new man, so
   making peace [2572] .' But if in Him the twain are created, and these
   are in His body, reasonably then, bearing the twain in Himself, He is
   as if Himself created; for those who were created in Himself He made
   one, and He was in them, as they. And thus, the two being created in
   Him, He may say suitably, The Lord created me.' For as by receiving our
   infirmities, He is said to be infirm Himself, though not Himself
   infirm, for He is the Power of God, and He became sin for us and a
   curse, though not having sinned Himself, but because He Himself bare
   our sins and our curse, so [2573] , by creating us in Him, let Him say,
   He created me for the works,' though not Himself a creature.

   56. For if, as they hold, the Essence of the Word being of created
   nature, therefore He says, The Lord created me,' being a creature, He
   was not created for us; but if He was not created for us, we are not
   created in Him; and, if not created in Him, we have Him not in
   ourselves but externally; as, for instance, as receiving instruction
   from Him as from a teacher [2574] . And it being so with us, sin has
   not lost its reign over the flesh, being inherent and not cast out of
   it. But the Apostle opposes such a doctrine a little before, when he
   says, For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus [2575] ;' and
   if in Christ we are created, then it is not He who is created, but we
   in Him; and thus the words He created' are for our sake. For because of
   our need, the Word, though being Creator, endured words which are used
   of creatures; which are not proper to Him, as being the Word, but are
   ours who are created in Him. And as, since the Father is always, so is
   His Word, and always being, always says I was daily His delight,
   rejoicing always before Him [2576] ,' and I am in the Father and the
   Father in Me [2577] ;' so, when for our need He became man,
   consistently does He use language, as ourselves, The Lord hath created
   Me,' that, by His dwelling in the flesh, sin might perfectly be
   expelled from the flesh, and we might have a free mind [2578] . For
   what ought He, when made man, to say? In the beginning I was man?' this
   were neither suitable to Him nor true; and as it beseemed not to say
   this, so it is natural and proper in the case of man to say, He
   created' and He made' Him. On this account then the reason of He
   created' is added, namely, the need of the works; and where the reason
   is added, surely the reason rightly explains the lection. Thus here,
   when He says He created,' He sets down the cause, the works;' on the
   other hand, when He signifies absolutely the generation from the
   Father, straightway He adds, Before all the hills He begets me [2579]
   ;' but He does not add the wherefore,' as in the case of He created,'
   saying, for the works,' but absolutely, He begets me,' as in the text,
   In the beginning was the Word [2580] .' For, though no works had been
   created, still the Word' of God was,' and the Word was God.' And His
   becoming man would not have taken place, had not the need of men become
   a cause. The Son then is not a creature.

   [2566] Two ends of our Lord's Incarnation are here mentioned; that He
   might die for us, and that He might renew us, answering nearly to those
   specified in Rom. iv. 25. who was delivered for our offences and raised
   again for our justification.' The general object of His coming,
   including both of these, is treated of in Incarn. esp. Â§Â§4-20. and in
   the two books against Apollinaris. Vid. supr. Â§8. Â§9. Also infr. Orat.

   course of redemption, i.e. incarnation, atonement, regeneration,
   justification, &c., as one sacrament, not drawing the line distinctly
   between the several agents, elements, or stages in it, but considering
   it to lie in the intercommunion of Christ's and our persons. Serm. 63.
   14. He speaks of His fortifying us against our passions and

   [2573] The word autos, Himself,' is all along used, where a later
   writer would have said His Person;' vid. supr. Â§45, n. 2; still there
   is more to be explained in this passage, which, taken in the letter,
   would speak a language very different from Athan.'s, as if the
   infirmities or the created nature of the Word were not more real than
   His imputed sinfulness. (vid. on the other hand infr. iii. 31-35). But
   nothing is more common in theology than comparisons which are only
   parallel to a certain point as regards the matter in hand, especially
   since many doctrines do not admit of exact illustrations. Our Lord's
   real manhood and imputed sinfulness were alike adjuncts to His Divine
   Person, which was of an Eternal and Infinite Nature; and therefore His
   Manhood may be compared to an Attribute, or to an accident, without
   meaning that it really was either.

   redemption was necessary at all. Texts which contrast the Word and the
   works.

   57. For had He been a creature, He had not said, He begets me,' for the
   creatures are from without, and are works of the Maker; but the
   Offspring is not from without nor a work, but from the Father, and
   proper to His Essence. Wherefore they are creatures; this God's Word
   and Only-begotten Son. For instance, Moses did not say of the creation,
   In the beginning He begat,' nor In the beginning was,' but In the
   beginning God created the heaven and the earth [2581] .' Nor did David
   say in the Psalm, Thy hands have "begotten me,"' but made me and
   fashioned me [2582] ,' everywhere applying the word made' to the
   creatures. But to the Son contrariwise; for he has not said I made,'
   but I begat [2583] ,' and He begets me,' and My heart uttered a good
   Word [2584] .' And in the instance of the creation, In the beginning He
   made;' but in the instance of the Son, In the beginning was the Word
   [2585] .' And there is this difference, that the creatures are made
   upon the beginning, and have a beginning of existence connected with an
   interval; wherefore also what is said of them, In the beginning He
   made,' is as much as saying of them, From the beginning He made:'--as
   the Lord, knowing that which He had made, taught, when He silenced the
   Pharisees, with the words, He which made them from the beginning, made
   them male and female [2586] ;' for from some beginning, when they were
   not yet, were originate things brought into being and created. This too
   the Holy Spirit has signified in the Psalms, saying, Thou, Lord, at the
   beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth [2587] ;' and again, O
   think upon Thy congregation which Thou hast purchased from the
   beginning [2588] ;' now it is plain that what takes place at the
   beginning, has a beginning of creation, and that from some beginning
   God purchased His congregation. And that In the beginning He made,'
   from his saying made,' means began to make,' Moses himself shews by
   saying, after the completion of all things, And God blessed the seventh
   day and sanctified it, because that in it He had rested from all His
   work which God began to make [2589] .' Therefore the creatures began to
   be made; but the Word of God, not having beginning of being, certainly
   did not begin to be, nor begin to come to be, but was ever. And the
   works have their beginning in their making, and their beginning
   precedes their coming to be; but the Word, not being of things which
   come to be, rather comes to be Himself the Framer of those which have a
   beginning. And the being of things originate is measured by their
   becoming [2590] , and from some beginning does God begin to make them
   through the Word, that it may be known that they were not before their
   origination; but the Word has His being, in no other beginning [2591]
   than the Father, whom [2592] they allow to be without beginning, so
   that He too exists without beginning in the Father, being His
   Offspring, not His creature.

   58. Thus does divine Scripture recognise the difference between the
   Offspring and things made, and shew that the Offspring is a Son, not
   begun from any beginning, but eternal; but that the thing made, as an
   external work of the Maker, began to come into being. John therefore
   delivering divine doctrine [2593] about the Son, and knowing the
   difference of the phrases, said not, In the beginning has become' or
   been made,' but In the beginning was the Word;' that we might
   understand Offspring' by was,' and not account of Him by intervals, but
   believe the Son always and eternally to exist. And with these proofs,
   how, O Arians, misunderstanding the passage in Deuteronomy, did you
   venture a fresh act of irreligion [2594] against the Lord, saying that
   He is a work,' or creature,' or indeed offspring?' for offspring and
   work you take to mean the same thing; but here too you shall be shewn
   to be as unlearned as you are irreligious. Your first passage is this,
   Is not He thy Father that bought thee? did He not make thee and create
   thee [2595] ?' And shortly after in the same Song he says, God that
   begat thee thou didst desert, and forgattest God that nourished thee
   [2596] .' Now the meaning conveyed in these passages is very
   remarkable; for he says not first He begat,' lest that term should be
   taken as indiscriminate with He made,' and these men should have a
   pretence for saying, Moses tells us indeed that God said from the
   beginning, "Let Us make man [2597] ,"' but he soon after says himself,
   God that begat thee thou didst desert,' as if the terms were
   indifferent; for offspring and work are the same. But after the words
   bought' and made,' he has added last of all begat,' that the sentence
   might carry its own interpretation; for in the word made' he accurately
   denotes what belongs to men by nature, to be works and things made; but
   in the word begat' he shews God's lovingkindness exercised towards men
   after He had created them. And since they have proved ungrateful upon
   this, thereupon Moses reproaches them, saying first, Do ye thus requite
   the Lord?' and then adds, Is not He thy Father that bought thee? Did He
   not make thee and create thee [2598] ?' And next he says, They
   sacrificed unto devils, not to God, to gods whom they knew not. New
   gods and strange came up, whom your fathers knew not; the God that
   begat thee thou didst desert [2599] .'

   59. For God not only created them to be men, but called them to be
   sons, as having begotten them. For the term begat' is here as elsewhere
   expressive of a Son, as He says by the Prophet, I begat sons and
   exalted them;' and generally, when Scripture wishes to signify a son,
   it does so, not by the term created,' but undoubtedly by that of
   begat.' And this John seems to say, He gave to them power to become
   children of God, even to them that believe on His Name; which were
   begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of
   man, but of God [2600] .' And here too the cautious distinction [2601]
   is well kept up, for first he says become,' because they are not called
   sons by nature but by adoption; then he says were begotten,' because
   they too had received at any rate the name of son. But the People, as
   says the Prophet, despised' their Benefactor. But this is God's
   kindness to man, that of whom He is Maker, of them according to grace
   He afterwards becomes Father also; becomes, that is, when men, His
   creatures, receive into their hearts, as the Apostle says, the Spirit
   of His Son, crying, Abba, Father [2602] .' And these are they who,
   having received the Word, gained power from Him to become sons of God;
   for they could not become sons, being by nature creatures, otherwise
   than by receiving the Spirit of the natural and true Son. Wherefore,
   that this might be, The Word became flesh,' that He might make man
   capable of Godhead. This same meaning may be gained also from the
   Prophet Malachi, who says, Hath not One God created us? Have we not all
   one Father [2603] ?' for first he puts created,' next Father,' to shew,
   as the other writers, that from the beginning we were creatures by
   nature, and God is our Creator through the Word; but afterwards we were
   made sons, and thenceforward God the Creator becomes our Father also.
   Therefore Father' is proper to the Son; and not creature,' but Son' is
   proper to the Father. Accordingly this passage also proves, that we are
   not sons by nature, but the Son who is in us [2604] ; and again, that
   God is not our Father by nature, but of that Word in us, in whom and
   because of whom we cry, Abba, Father [2605] .' And so in like manner,
   the Father calls them sons in whomsoever He sees His own Son, and says,
   I begat;' since begetting is significant of a Son, and making is
   indicative of the works. And thus it is that we are not begotten first,
   but made; for it is written, Let Us make man [2606] ;' but afterwards,
   on receiving the grace of the Spirit, we are said thenceforth to be
   begotten also; just as the great Moses in his Song with an apposite
   meaning says first He bought,' and afterwards He begat;' lest, hearing
   He begat,' they might forget their own original nature; but that they
   might know that from the beginning they are creatures, but when
   according to grace they are said to be begotten, as sons, still no less
   than before are men works according to nature.

   60. And that creature and offspring are not the same, but differ from
   each other in nature and the signification of the words, the Lord
   Himself shews even in the Proverbs. For having said, The Lord created
   me a beginning of His ways;' He has added, But before all the hills He
   begat me.' If then the Word were by nature and in His Essence [2607] a
   creature, and there were no difference between offspring and creature,
   He would not have added, He begat me,' but had been satisfied with He
   created,' as if that term implied He begat;' but, as it is, after
   saying, He created me a beginning of His ways for His works,' He has
   added, not simply begat me,' but with the connection of the conjunction
   But,' as guarding thereby the term created,' when he says, But before
   all the hills He begat me.' For begat me' succeeding in such close
   connection to created me,' makes the meaning one, and shews that
   created' is said with an object [2608] , but that begat me' is prior to
   created me.' For as, if He had said the reverse, The Lord begat me,'
   and went on, But before the hills He created me,' created' would
   certainly precede begat,' so having said first created,' and then added
   But before all the hills He begat me,' He necessarily shews that begat'
   preceded created.' For in saying, Before all He begat me,' He intimates
   that He is other than all things; it having been shewn to be true
   [2609] in an earlier part of this book, that no one creature was made
   before another, but all things originate subsisted at once together
   upon one and the same command [2610] . Therefore neither do the words
   which follow created,' also follow begat me;' but in the case of
   created' is added beginning of ways,' but of begat me,' He says not, He
   begat me as a beginning,' but before all He begat me.' But He who is
   before all is not a beginning of all, but is other than all [2611] ;
   but if other than all (in which all' the beginning of all is included),
   it follows that He is other than the creatures; and it becomes a clear
   point, that the Word, being other than all things and before all,
   afterwards is created a beginning of the ways for works,' because He
   became man, that, as the Apostle has said, He who is the Beginning' and
   First-born from the dead, in all things might have the preeminence
   [2612] .'

   61. Such then being the difference between created' and begat me,' and
   between beginning of ways' and before all,' God, being first Creator,
   next, as has been said, becomes Father of men, because of His Word
   dwelling in them. But in the case of the Word the reverse; for God,
   being His Father by nature, becomes afterwards both His Creator and
   Maker, when the Word puts on that flesh which was created and made, and
   becomes man. For, as men, receiving the Spirit of the Son, become
   children through Him, so the Word of God, when He Himself puts on the
   flesh of man, then is said both to be created and to have been made. If
   then we are by nature sons, then is He by nature creature and work; but
   if we become sons by adoption and grace, then has the Word also, when
   in grace towards us He became man, said, The Lord created me.' And in
   the next place, when He put on a created nature and became like us in
   body, reasonably was He therefore called both our Brother and
   First-born [2613] .' For though it was after us [2614] that He was made
   man for us, and our brother by similitude of body, still He is
   therefore called and is the First-born' of us, because, all men being
   lost, according to the transgression of Adam, His flesh before all
   others was saved and liberated, as being the Word's body [2615] ; and
   henceforth we, becoming incorporate with It, are saved after Its
   pattern. For in It the Lord becomes our guide to the Kingdom of Heaven
   and to His own Father, saying, I am the way' and the door [2616] ,' and
   through Me all must enter.' Whence also is He said to be First-born
   from the dead [2617] ,' not that He died before us, for we had died
   first; but because having undergone death for us and abolished it, He
   was the first to rise, as man, for our sakes raising His own Body.
   Henceforth He having risen, we too from Him and because of Him rise in
   due course from the dead.

   62. But if He is also called First-born of the creation [2618] ,' still
   this is not as if He were levelled to the creatures, and only first of
   them in point of time (for how should that be, since He is
   Only-begotten?'), but it is because of the Word's condescension [2619]
   to the creatures, according to which He has become the Brother' of
   many.' For the term Only-begotten' is used where there are no brethren,
   but First-born [2620] ' because of brethren. Accordingly it is nowhere
   written in the Scriptures, the first-born of God,' nor the creature of
   God;' but Only-begotten' and Son' and Word' and Wisdom,' refer to Him
   as proper to the Father [2621] . Thus, We have seen His glory, the
   glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father [2622] ;' and God sent His
   Only-begotten Son [2623] ;' and O Lord, Thy Word endureth for ever
   [2624] ;' and In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
   God;' and Christ the Power of God and the Wisdom of God [2625] ;' and
   This is My beloved Son;' and Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living
   God [2626] .' But first-born' implied the descent to the creation
   [2627] ; for of it has He been called first-born; and He created'
   implies His grace towards the works, for for them is He created. If
   then He is Only-begotten, as indeed He is, First-born' needs some
   explanation; but if He be really First-born, then He is not
   Only-begotten [2628] . For the same cannot be both Only-begotten and
   First-born, except in different relations;--that is, Only-begotten,
   because of His generation from the Father, as has been said; and
   First-born, because of His condescension to the creation and His making
   the many His brethren. Certainly, those two terms being inconsistent
   with each other, one should say that the attribute of being
   Only-begotten has justly the preference in the instance of the Word, in
   that there is no other Word, or other Wisdom, but He alone is very Son
   of the Father. Moreover [2629] , as was before [2630] said, not in
   connection with any reason, but absolutely [2631] it is said of Him,
   The Only-begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father [2632] ;' but
   the word First-born' has again the creation as a reason in connection
   with it, which Paul proceeds to say, for in Him all things were created
   [2633] .' But if all the creatures were created in Him, He is other
   than the creatures, and is not a creature, but the Creator of the
   creatures.

   63. Not then because He was from the Father was He called First-born,'
   but because in Him the creation came to be; and as before the creation
   He was the Son, through whom was the creation, so also before He was
   called the First-born of the whole creation, not the less was the Word
   Himself with God and the Word was God. But this also not understanding,
   these irreligious men go about saying, If He is First-born of all
   creation, it is plain that He too is one of the creation.' Senseless
   men! if He is simply First-born [2634] of the whole creation,' then He
   is other than the whole creation; for he says not, He is First-born
   above the rest of the creatures,' lest He be reckoned to be as one of
   the creatures, but it is written, of the whole creation,' that He may
   appear other than the creation [2635] . Reuben, for instance, is not
   said to be first-born of all the children of Jacob [2636] , but of
   Jacob himself and his brethren; lest he should be thought to be some
   other beside the children of Jacob. Nay, even concerning the Lord
   Himself the Apostle says not, that He may become First-born of all,'
   lest He be thought to bear a body other than ours, but among many
   brethren [2637] ,' because of the likeness of the flesh. If then the
   Word also were one of the creatures, Scripture would have said of Him
   also that He was First-born of other creatures; but in fact, the saints
   saying that He is First-born of the whole creation [2638] ,' the Son of
   God is plainly shewn to be other than the whole creation and not a
   creature. For if He is a creature, He will be First-born of Himself.
   How then is it possible, O Arians, for Him to be before and after
   Himself? next, if He is a creature, and the whole creation through Him
   came to be, and in Him consists, how can He both create the creation
   and be one of the things which consist in Him? Since then such a notion
   is in itself unseemly, it is proved against them by the truth, that He
   is called First-born among many brethren' because of the relationship
   of the flesh, and First-born from the dead,' because the resurrection
   of the dead is from Him and after Him; and First-born of the whole
   creation,' because of the Father's love to man, which brought it to
   pass that in His Word not only all things consist [2639] ,' but the
   creation itself, of which the Apostle speaks, waiting for the
   manifestation of the sons of God, shall be delivered' one time from the
   bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God
   [2640] .' Of this creation thus delivered, the Lord will be First-born,
   both of it and of all those who are made children, that by His being
   called first, those that come after Him may abide [2641] , as depending
   on the Word as a beginning [2642] .

   64. And I think that the irreligious men themselves will be shamed from
   such a thought; for if the case stands not as we have said, but they
   will rule it that He is First-born of the whole creation' as in
   essence--a creature among creatures, let them reflect that they will be
   conceiving Him as brother and fellow of the things without reason and
   life. For of the whole creation these also are parts; and the
   First-born' must be first indeed in point of time but only thus, and in
   kind and similitude [2643] must be the same with all. How then can they
   say this without exceeding all measures of irreligion? or who will
   endure them, if this is their language? or who can but hate them even
   imagining such things? For it is evident to all, that neither for
   Himself, as being a creature, nor as having any connection according to
   essence with the whole creation, has He been called First-born' of it:
   but because the Word, when at the beginning He framed the creatures,
   condescended to things originate, that it might be possible for them to
   come to be. For they could not have endured His nature, which was
   untempered splendour, even that of the Father, unless condescending by
   the Father's love for man He had supported them and taken hold of them
   and brought them into existence [2644] ; and next, because, by this
   condescension of the Word, the creation too is made a son [2645]
   through Him, that He might be in all respects First-born' of it, as has
   been said, both in creating, and also in being brought for the sake of
   all into this very world. For so it is written, When He bringeth the
   First-born into the world, He saith, Let all the Angels of God worship
   Him [2646] .' Let Christ's enemies hear and tear themselves to pieces,
   because His coming into the world is what makes Him called First-born'
   of all; and thus the Son is the Father's Only-begotten,' because He
   alone is from Him, and He is the First-born of creation,' because of
   this adoption of all as sons [2647] . And as He is First-born among
   brethren and rose from the dead the first fruits of them that slept
   [2648] ;' so, since it became Him in all things to have the preeminence
   [2649] ,' therefore He is created a beginning of ways,' that we,
   walking along it and entering through Him who says, I am the Way' and
   the Door,' and partaking of the knowledge of the Father, may also hear
   the words, Blessed are the undefiled in the Way,' and Blessed are the
   pure in heart, for they shall see God [2650] .'

   65. And thus since the truth declares that the Word is not by nature a
   creature, it is fitting now to say, in what sense He is beginning of
   ways.' For when the first way, which was through Adam, was lost, and in
   place of paradise we deviated unto death, and heard the words, Dust
   thou art, and unto dust [2651] shalt thou return,' therefore the Word
   of God, who loves man, puts on Him created flesh at the Father's will
   [2652] , that whereas the first man had made it dead through the
   transgression, He Himself might quicken it in the blood of His own body
   [2653] , and might open for us a way new and living,' as the Apostle
   says, through the veil, that is to say, His flesh [2654] ;' which he
   signifies elsewhere thus, Wherefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a
   new creation; old things are passed away, behold all things are become
   new [2655] .' But if a new creation has come to pass, some one must be
   first of this creation; now a man, made of earth only, such as we are
   become from the transgression, he could not be. For in the first
   creation, men had become unfaithful, and through them that first
   creation had been lost; and there was need of some one else to renew
   the first creation, and preserve the new which had come to be.
   Therefore from love to man none other than the Lord, the beginning' of
   the new creation, is created as the Way,' and consistently says, The
   Lord created me a beginning of ways for His works;' that man might walk
   no longer according to that first creation, but there being as it were
   a beginning of a new creation, and with the Christ a beginning of its
   ways,' we might follow Him henceforth, who says to us, I am the
   Way:'--as the blessed Apostle teaches in Colossians, saying, He is the
   Head of the body, the Church, who is the Beginning, the First-born from
   the dead, that in all things He might have the preeminence.'

   66. For if, as has been said, because of the resurrection from the dead
   He is called a beginning, and then a resurrection took place when He,
   bearing our flesh, had given Himself to death for us, it is evident
   that His words, He created me a beginning of ways,' is indicative not
   of His essence [2656] , but of His bodily presence. For to the body
   death was proper [2657] ; and in like manner to the bodily presence are
   the words proper, The Lord created me a beginning of His ways.' For
   since the Saviour was thus created according to the flesh, and had
   become a beginning of things new created, and had our first fruits,
   viz. that human flesh which He took to Himself, therefore after Him, as
   is fit, is created also the people to come, David saying, Let this be
   written for another generation, and the people that shall be created
   shall praise the Lord [2658] .' And again in the twenty-first Psalm,
   The generation to come shall declare unto the Lord, and they shall
   declare His righteousness, unto a people that shall be born whom the
   Lord made [2659] .' For we shall no more hear, In the day that thou
   eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die [2660] ,' but Where I am, there
   ye' shall be also;' so that we may say, We are His workmanship, created
   unto good works [2661] .' And again, since God's work, that is, man,
   though created perfect, has become wanting through the transgression,
   and dead by sin, and it was unbecoming that the work of God should
   remain imperfect (wherefore all the saints were praying concerning
   this, for instance in the hundred and thirty-seventh Psalm, saying,
   Lord, Thou shalt requite for me; despise not then the works of Thine
   hands [2662] '); therefore the perfect [2663] Word of God puts around
   Him an imperfect body, and is said to be created for the works;' that,
   paying the debt [2664] in our stead, He might, by Himself, perfect what
   was wanting to man. Now immortality was wanting to him, and the way to
   paradise. This then is what the Saviour says, I glorified Thee on the
   earth, I perfected the work which Thou hast given Me to do [2665] ;'
   and again, The works which the Father hath given Me to perfect, the
   same works that I do, bear witness of Me;' but the works [2666] ' He
   here says that the Father had given Him to perfect, are those for which
   He is created, saying in the Proverbs, The Lord created me a beginning
   of His ways, for His works;' for it is all one to say, The Father hath
   given me the works,' and The Lord created me for the works.'

   67. When then received He the works to perfect, O God's enemies? for
   from this also He created' will be understood. If ye say, At the
   beginning when He brought them into being out of what was not,' it is
   an untruth; for they were not yet made; whereas He appears to speak as
   taking what was already in being. Nor is it pious to refer to the time
   which preceded the Word's becoming flesh, lest His coming should
   thereupon seem superfluous, since for the sake of these works that
   coming took place. Therefore it remains for us to say that when He has
   become man, then He took the works. For then He perfected them, by
   healing our wounds and vouchsafing to us the resurrection from the
   dead. But if, when the Word became flesh, then were given to Him the
   works, plainly when He became man, then also is He created for the
   works. Not of His essence then is He created' indicative, as has many
   times been said, but of His bodily generation. For then, because the
   works were become imperfect and mutilated from the transgression, He is
   said in respect to the body to be created; that by perfecting them and
   making them whole, He might present the Church unto the Father, as the
   Apostle says, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but holy
   and without blemish [2667] .' Mankind then is perfected in Him and
   restored, as it was made at the beginning, nay, with greater grace.
   For, on rising from the dead, we shall no longer fear death, but shall
   ever reign in Christ in the heavens. And this has been done, since the
   own Word of God Himself, who is from the Father, has put on the flesh,
   and become man. For if, being a creature, He had become man, man had
   remained just what he was, not joined to God; for how had a work been
   joined to the Creator by a work [2668] ? or what succour had come from
   like to like, when one as well as other needed it [2669] ? And how,
   were the Word a creature, had He power to undo God's sentence, and to
   remit sin, whereas it is written in the Prophets, that this is God's
   doing? For who is a God like unto Thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and
   passeth by transgression [2670] ?' For whereas God has said, Dust thou
   art, and unto dust shalt thou return [2671] ,' men have become mortal;
   how then could things originate undo sin? but the Lord is He who has
   undone it, as He says Himself, Unless the Son shall make you free
   [2672] ;' and the Son, who made free, has shewn in truth that He is no
   creature, nor one of things originate, but the proper Word and Image of
   the Father's Essence, who at the beginning sentenced, and alone
   remitteth sins. For since it is said in the Word, Dust thou art, and
   unto dust thou shalt return,' suitably through the Word Himself and in
   Him the freedom and the undoing of the condemnation has come to pass.

   68. Yet,' they say, though the Saviour were a creature, God was able to
   speak the word only and undo the curse.' And so another will tell them
   in like manner, Without His coming among us at all, God was able just
   to speak and undo the curse;' but we must consider what was expedient
   for mankind, and not what simply is possible with God [2673] . He could
   have destroyed, before the ark of Noah, the then transgressors; but He
   did it after the ark. He could too, without Moses, have spoken the word
   only and have brought the people out of Egypt; but it profited to do it
   through Moses. And God was able without the judges to save His people;
   but it was profitable for the people that for a season judges should be
   raised up to them. The Saviour too might have come among us from the
   beginning, or on His coming might not have been delivered to Pilate;
   but He came at the fulness of the ages [2674] ,' and when sought for
   said, I am He [2675] .' For what He does, that is profitable for men,
   and was not fitting in any other way; and what is profitable and
   fitting, for that He provides [2676] . Accordingly He came, not that He
   might be ministered unto, but that He might minister [2677] ,' and
   might work our salvation. Certainly He was able to speak the Law from
   heaven, but He saw that it was expedient to men for Him to speak from
   Sinai; and that He has done, that it might be possible for Moses to go
   up, and for them hearing the word near them the rather to believe.
   Moreover, the good reason of what He did may be seen thus; if God had
   but spoken, because it was in His power, and so the curse had been
   undone, the power had been shewn of Him who gave the word, but man had
   become such as Adam was before the transgression, having received grace
   from without [2678] , and not having it united to the body; (for he was
   such when he was placed in Paradise) nay, perhaps had become worse,
   because he had learned to transgress. Such then being his condition,
   had he been seduced by the serpent, there had been fresh need for God
   to give command and undo the curse; and thus the need had become
   interminable [2679] , and men had remained under guilt not less than
   before, as being enslaved to sin; and, ever sinning, would have ever
   needed one to pardon them, and had never become free, being in
   themselves flesh, and ever worsted by the Law because of the infirmity
   of the flesh.

   69. Again, if the Son were a creature, man had remained mortal as
   before, not being joined to God; for a creature had not joined
   creatures to God, as seeking itself one to join it [2680] ; nor would a
   portion of the creation have been the creation's salvation, as needing
   salvation itself. To provide against this also, He sends His own Son,
   and He becomes Son of Man, by taking created flesh; that, since all
   were under sentence of death, He, being other than them all, might
   Himself for all offer to death His own body; and that henceforth, as if
   all had died through Him, the word of that sentence might be
   accomplished (for all died [2681] ' in Christ), and all through Him
   might thereupon become free from sin and from the curse which came upon
   it, and might truly abide [2682] for ever, risen from the dead and
   clothed in immortality and incorruption. For the Word being clothed in
   the flesh, as has many times been explained, every bite of the serpent
   began to be utterly staunched from out it; and whatever evil sprung
   from the motions of the flesh, to be cut away, and with these death
   also was abolished, the companion of sin, as the Lord Himself says
   [2683] , The prince of this world cometh, and findeth nothing in Me;'
   and For this end was He manifested,' as John has written, that He might
   destroy the works of the devil [2684] .' And these being destroyed from
   the flesh, we all were thus liberated by the kinship of the flesh, and
   for the future were joined, even we, to the Word. And being joined to
   God, no longer do we abide upon earth; but, as He Himself has said,
   where He is, there shall we be also; and henceforward we shall fear no
   longer the serpent, for he was brought to nought when he was assailed
   by the Saviour in the flesh, and heard Him say, Get thee behind Me,
   Satan [2685] ,' and thus he is cast out of paradise into the eternal
   fire. Nor shall we have to watch against woman beguiling us, for in the
   resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as
   the Angels [2686] ;' and in Christ Jesus it shall be a new creation,'
   and neither male nor female, but all and in all Christ [2687] ;' and
   where Christ is, what fear, what danger can still happen?

   70. But this would not have come to pass, had the Word been a creature;
   for with a creature, the devil, himself a creature, would have ever
   continued the battle, and man, being between the two, had been ever in
   peril of death, having none in whom and through whom he might be joined
   to God and delivered from all fear. Whence the truth shews us that the
   Word is not of things originate, but rather Himself their Framer. For
   therefore did He assume the body originate and human, that having
   renewed it as its Framer, He might deify it [2688] in Himself, and thus
   might introduce us all into the kingdom of heaven after His likeness.
   For man had not been deified if joined to a creature, or unless the Son
   were very God; nor had man been brought into the Father's presence,
   unless He had been His natural and true Word who had put on the body.
   And as we had not been delivered from sin and the curse, unless it had
   been by nature human flesh, which the Word put on (for we should have
   had nothing common with what was foreign), so also the man had not been
   deified, unless the Word who became flesh had been by nature from the
   Father and true and proper to Him. For therefore the union was of this
   kind, that He might unite what is man by nature to Him who is in the
   nature of the Godhead, and his salvation and deification might be sure.
   Therefore let those who deny that the Son is from the Father by nature
   and proper to His Essence, deny also that He took true human flesh
   [2689] of Mary Ever-Virgin [2690] ; for in neither case had it been of
   profit to us men, whether the Word were not true and naturally Son of
   God, or the flesh not true which He assumed. But surely He took true
   flesh, though Valentinus rave; yea the Word was by nature Very God,
   though Ario-maniacs rave [2691] ; and in that flesh has come to pass
   the beginning [2692] of our new creation, He being created man for our
   sake, and having made for us that new way, as has been said.

   71. The Word then is neither creature nor work; for creature, thing
   made, work, are all one; and were He creature and thing made, He would
   also be work. Accordingly He has not said, He created Me a work,' nor
   He made Me with the works,' lest He should appear to be in nature and
   essence [2693] a creature; nor, He created Me to make works,' lest, on
   the other hand, according to the perverseness of the irreligious, He
   should seem as an instrument [2694] made for our sake. Nor again has He
   declared, He created Me before the works,' lest, as He really is before
   all, as an Offspring, so, if created also before the works, He should
   give Offspring' and He created' the same meaning. But He has said with
   exact discrimination [2695] , for the works;' as much as to say, The
   Father has made Me, into flesh, that I might be man,' which again shews
   that He is not a work but an offspring. For as he who comes into a
   house, is not part of the house, but is other than the house, so He who
   is created for the works, must be by nature other than the works. But
   if otherwise, as you hold, O Arians, the Word of God be a work, by what
   [2696] Hand and Wisdom did He Himself come into being? for all things
   that came to be, came by the Hand and Wisdom of God, who Himself says,
   My hand hath made all these things [2697] ;' and David says in the
   Psalm, And Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundations of
   the earth, and the heavens are the work of Thy hands [2698] ;' and
   again, in the hundred and forty-second Psalm, I do remember the time
   past, I muse upon all Thy works, yea I exercise myself in the works of
   Thy hands [2699] .' Therefore if by the Hand of God the works are
   wrought, and it is written that all things were made through the Word,'
   and without Him was not made one thing [2700] ,' and again, One Lord
   Jesus, through whom are all things [2701] ,' and in Him all things
   consist [2702] ,' it is very plain that the Son cannot be a work, but
   He is the Hand [2703] of God and the Wisdom. This knowing, the martyrs
   in Babylon, Ananias, Azarias, and Misael, arraign the Arian irreligion.
   For when they say, O all ye works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord,' they
   recount things in heaven, things on earth, and the whole creation, as
   works; but the Son they name not. For they say not, Bless, O Word, and
   praise, O Wisdom;' to shew that all other things are both praising and
   are works; but the Word is not a work nor of those that praise, but is
   praised with the Father and worshipped and confessed as God [2704] ,
   being His Word and Wisdom, and of the works the Framer. This too the
   Spirit has declared in the Psalms with a most apposite distinction, the
   Word of the Lord is true, and all His works are faithful [2705] ;' as
   in another Psalm too He says, O Lord, how manifold are Thy works! in
   Wisdom hast Thou made them all [2706] .'

   72. But if the Word were a work, then certainly He as others had been
   made in Wisdom; nor would Scripture distinguish Him from the works, nor
   while it named them works, preach Him as Word and own Wisdom of God.
   But, as it is, distinguishing Him from the works, He shews that Wisdom
   is Framer of the works, and not a work. This distinction Paul also
   observes, writing to the Hebrews, The Word of God is quick and
   powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, reaching even to the
   dividing of soul and spirit, joints and marrow, and a discerner of the
   thoughts and intents of the heart, neither is there any creature hidden
   before Him, but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of Him with
   whom is our account [2707] .' For behold he calls things originate
   creature;' but the Son he recognises as the Word of God, as if He were
   other than the creatures. And again saying, All things are naked and
   open to the eyes of Him with whom is our account,' he signifies that He
   is other than all of them. For hence it is that He judges, but each of
   all things originate is bound to give account to Him. And so also, when
   the whole creation is groaning together with us in order to be set free
   from the bondage of corruption, the Son is thereby shewn to be other
   than the creatures. For if He were creature, He too would be one of
   those who groan, and would need one who should bring adoption and
   deliverance to Himself as well as others. But if the whole creation
   groans together, for the sake of freedom from the bondage of
   corruption, whereas the Son is not of those that groan nor of those who
   need freedom, but He it is who gives sonship and freedom to all, saying
   to the Jews of His time [2708] , The servant remains not in the house
   for ever, but the Son remaineth for ever; if then the Son shall make
   you free, ye shall be free indeed [2709] ;' it is clearer than the
   light from these considerations also, that the Word of God is not a
   creature but true Son, and by nature genuine, of the Father. Concerning
   then The Lord hath created me a beginning of the ways,' this is
   sufficient, as I think, though in few words, to afford matter to the
   learned to frame more ample refutations of the Arian heresy.

   [2613] Rom. viii. 29. Bishop Bull's hypothesis about the sense of
   prototokos tes ktiseos has been commented on supr. p. 347. As far as
   Athan.'s discussion proceeds in this section, it only relates to
   prototokos of men (i.e. from the dead), and is equivalent to the
   beginning of ways.'

   [2614] Marcellus seems to have argued against Asterius from the same
   texts (Euseb. in Marc. p. 12), that, since Christ is called first-born
   from the dead,' though others had been recalled to life before Him,
   therefore He is called first-born of creation,' not in point of time,
   but of dignity. vid. Montacut. Not. p. 11. Yet Athan. argues
   contrariwise. Orat. iv. 29.

   [2617] Rev. i. 5.

   [2618] Here again, though speaking of the first-born of creation,'
   Athan. simply views the phrase as equivalent to first-born of the new
   creation or "brother" of many;' and so infr. first-born because of the
   brotherhood He has made with many.'

   [2619] Bp. Bull considers sunkatabasis as equivalent to a figurative
   gennesis, an idea which (vid. supr. p. 346 sq.) seems quite foreign
   from Athan.'s meaning. In Bull's sense of the word, Athan. could not
   have said that the senses of Only-begotten and First-born were contrary
   to each other, Or. i. 28. Sunkatabenai occurs supr. 51 fin. of the
   Incarnation. What is meant by it will be found infr. 78-81. viz. that
   our Lord came to implant in the creatures a type and semblance of His
   Image;' which is just what is here maintained against Bull. The whole
   passage referred to is a comment on the word sunkatabasis, and begins
   and ends with an introduction of that word. Vid. also c. Gent. 47.

   [2620] Vid. Rom. viii. 29.

   [2621] This passage has been urged against Bull supr. Exc. B. All the
   words (says Athan.) which are proper to the Son, and describe Him
   fitly, are expressive of what is internal' to the Divine Nature, as
   Begotten, Word, Wisdom, Glory, Hand, &c., but (as he adds presently)
   the first-born,' like beginning of ways,' is relative to creation; and
   therefore cannot denote our Lord's essence or Divine subsistence, but
   something temporal, an office, character, or the like.

   [2628] This passage is imitated by Theodoret. in Coloss. i. 15, but the
   passages from the Fathers referable to these Orations are too many to
   enumerate.

   [2629] We now come to a third and wider sense of prototokos, as found
   (not in Rom. viii. 29, and Col. i. 18, but) in Col. i. 15, where by
   creation' Athan. understands all things visible and invisible.' As then
   for the works' was just now taken to argue that created' was used in a
   relative and restricted sense, the same is shewn as regards first-born'
   by the words for in Him all things were created.'

   [2632] John i. 18.

   [2633] Col. i. 16.

   [2634] It would be perhaps better to translate first-born to the
   creature,' to give Athan.'s idea; tes ktiseos not being a partitive
   genitive, or prototokos a superlative (though he presently so considers
   it), but a simple appellative and tes kt. a common genitive of
   relation, as the king of a country,' the owner of a house.' First-born
   of creation' is like author, type, life of creation.' Hence S. Paul
   goes on at once to say, for in Him all things were made,' not simply by
   and for,' as at the end of the verse; or as Athan. says here, because
   in Him the creation came to be.' On the distinction of dia and en,
   referring respectively to the first and second creations, vid. In illud
   Omn. 2. (Supr. p. 88.)

   [2635] To understand this passage, the Greek idiom must be kept in
   view. Cf. Milton's imitation the fairest of her daughters Eve.' Vid. as
   regards the very word protos, John i. 15; and supr. Â§30, note 3, also
   pleisten e emprosthen 3 Maccab. 7, 21. Accordingly as in the
   comparative to obviate this exclusion, we put in the word other' (ante
   alios immanior omnes), so too in the Greek superlative, Socrates is
   wisest of "other" heathen.' Athanasius then says in this passage, that
   first-born of creatures' implies that our Lord was not a creature;
   whereas it is not said of Him first-born of brethren,' lest He should
   he excluded from men, but first-born "among" brethren,' where among' is
   equivalent to other.'

   [2640] Rom. viii. 19, 21. Thus there are two senses in which our Lord
   is first-born to the creation;' viz. in its first origin, and in its
   restoration after man's fall; as he says more clearly in the next
   section.

   [2644] He does not here say with Asterius that God could not create man
   immediately, for the Word is God, but that He did not create him
   without at the same time infusing a grace or presence from Himself into
   his created nature to enable it to endure His external plastic hand; in
   other words, that he was created in Him, not as something external to
   Him (in spite of the dia supr.63, n. 1. vid. supr. de Decr. 19. 3. and
   Gent. 47. where the sunkatabasis is spoken of.

   is He first-born, in that human nature is adopted in Him. Leo Serm. 63.

   [2646] Heb. i. 6.

   [2647] Thus he considers that first-born' is mainly a title, connected
   with the Incarnation, and also connected with our Lord's office at the
   creation (vid. parallel of Priesthood, Â§8, n. 4). In each economy it
   has the same meaning; it belongs to Him as the type, idea, or rule on
   which the creature was made or new-made, and the life by which it is
   sustained. Both economies are mentioned Incarn. 13, 14. Orat. i. 51.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XXII.--Texts Explained; Sixthly, the Context of Proverbs viii.
   22 Vz. 22-30 It is right to interpret this passage by the Regula Fidei.
   Founded' is used in contrast to superstructure; and it implies, as in
   the case of stones in building, previous existence. Before the world'
   signifies the divine intention and purpose. Recurrence to Prov. viii.
   22, and application of it to created Wisdom as seen in the works. The
   Son reveals the Father, first by the works, then by the Incarnation.

   But since the heretics, reading the next verse, take a perverse view of
   that also, because it is written, He founded me before the world [2710]
   ,' namely, that this is said of the Godhead of the Word and not of His
   incarnate Presence [2711] , it is necessary, explaining this verse
   also, to shew their error.

   73. It is written, The Lord in Wisdom founded the earth [2712] ;' if
   then by Wisdom the earth is founded, how can He who founds be founded?
   nay, this too is said after the manner of proverbs [2713] , and we must
   in like manner investigate its sense; that we may know that, while by
   Wisdom the Father frames and founds the earth to be firm and steadfast
   [2714] , Wisdom Itself is founded for us, that It may become beginning
   and foundation of our new creation and renewal. Accordingly here as
   before, He says not, Before the world He hath made me Word or Son,'
   lest there should be as it were a beginning of His making. For this we
   must seek before all things, whether He is Son [2715] , and on this
   point specially search the Scriptures [2716] ;' for this it was, when
   the Apostles were questioned, that Peter answered, saying, Thou art the
   Christ, the Son of the Living God [2717] .' This also the father [2718]
   of the Arian heresy asked as one of his first questions; If Thou be the
   Son of God [2719] ;' for he knew that this is the truth and the
   sovereign principle of our faith; and that, if He were Himself the Son,
   the tyranny of the devil would have its end; but if He were a creature,
   He too was one of those descended from that Adam whom he deceived, and
   he had no cause for anxiety. For the same reason the Jews of the day
   [2720] were angered, because the Lord said that He was Son of God, and
   that God was His proper Father. For had He called Himself one of the
   creatures, or said, I am a work,' they had not been startled at the
   intelligence, nor thought such words blasphemy, knowing, as they did,
   that even Angels had come among their fathers; but since He called
   Himself Son, they perceived that such was not the note of a creature,
   but of Godhead and of the Father's nature [2721] . The Arians then
   ought, even in imitation of their own father the devil, to take some
   special pains [2722] on this point; and if He has said, He founded me
   to be Word or Son,' then to think as they do; but if He has not so
   spoken, not to invent for themselves what is not.

   74. For He says not, Before the world He founded me as Word or Son,'
   but simply, He founded me,' to shew again, as I have said, that not for
   His own sake [2723] but for those who are built upon Him does He here
   also speak, after the way of proverbs. For this knowing, the Apostle
   also writes, Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which
   is Jesus Christ; but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon
   [2724] .' And it must be that the foundation should be such as the
   things built on it, that they may admit of being well compacted
   together. Being then the Word, He has not, as Word [2725] , any such as
   Himself, who may be compacted with Him; for He is Only-begotten; but
   having become man, He has the like of Him, those namely the likeness of
   whose flesh He has put on. Therefore according to His manhood He is
   founded, that we, as precious stones, may admit of building upon Him,
   and may become a temple of the Holy Ghost who dwelleth in us. And as He
   is a foundation, and we stones built upon Him, so again He is a Vine
   and we knit to Him as branches,--not according to the Essence of the
   Godhead; for this surely is impossible; but according to His manhood,
   for the branches must be like the vine, since we are like Him according
   to the flesh. Moreover, since the heretics have such human notions, we
   may suitably confute them with human resemblances contained in the very
   matter they urge. Thus He saith not, He made me a foundation,' lest He
   might seem to be made and to have a beginning of being, and they might
   thence find a shameless occasion of irreligion; but, He founded me.'
   Now what is founded is founded for the sake of the stones which are
   raised upon it; it is not a random process, but a stone is first
   transported from the mountain and set down in the depth of the earth.
   And while a stone is in the mountain, it is not yet founded; but when
   need demands, and it is transported, and laid in the depth of the
   earth, then forthwith if the stone could speak, it would say, He now
   founded me, who brought me hither from the mountain.' Therefore the
   Lord also did not when founded take a beginning of existence; for He
   was the Word before that; but when He put on our body, which He severed
   and took from Mary, then He says He hath founded me;' as much as to
   say, Me, being the Word, He hath enveloped in a body of earth.' For so
   He is founded for our sakes, taking on Him what is ours [2726] , that
   we, as incorporated and compacted and bound together in Him through the
   likeness of the flesh, may attain unto a perfect man, and abide [2727]
   immortal and incorruptible.

   75. Nor let the words before the world' and before He made the earth'
   and before the mountains were settled' disturb any one; for they very
   well accord with founded' and created;' for here again allusion is made
   to the Economy according to the flesh. For though the grace which came
   to us from the Saviour appeared, as the Apostle says, just now, and has
   come when He sojourned among us; yet this grace had been prepared even
   before we came into being, nay, before the foundation of the world, and
   the reason why is kindly and wonderful. It beseemed not that God should
   counsel concerning us afterwards, lest He should appear ignorant of our
   fate. The God of all then,--creating us by His own Word, and knowing
   our destinies better than we, and foreseeing that, being made good
   [2728] ,' we should in the event be transgressors of the commandment,
   and be thrust out of paradise for disobedience,--being loving and kind,
   prepared beforehand in His own Word, by whom also He created us [2729]
   , the Economy of our salvation; that though by the serpent's deceit we
   fell from Him, we might not remain quite dead, but having in the Word
   the redemption and salvation which was afore prepared for us, we might
   rise again and abide immortal, what time He should have been created
   for us a beginning of the ways,' and He who was the First-born of
   creation' should become first-born' of the brethren,' and again should
   rise first-fruits of the dead.' This Paul the blessed Apostle teaches
   in his writings; for, as interpreting the words of the Proverbs before
   the world' and before the earth was,' he thus speaks to Timothy [2730]
   ; Be partaker of the afflictions of the Gospel according to the power
   of God, who hath saved us and called us with a holy calling, not
   according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace,
   which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began, but is now
   made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath
   abolished death, and brought to light life [2731] .' And to the
   Ephesians; Blessed be God even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
   hath blessed us with all spiritual blessing in heavenly places in
   Christ Jesus, according as He hath chosen us in Him before the
   foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame
   before Him in love, having predestinated us to the adoption of children
   by Jesus Christ to Himself [2732] .'

   76. How then has He chosen us, before we came into existence, but that,
   as he says himself, in Him we were represented [2733] beforehand? and
   how at all, before men were created, did He predestinate us unto
   adoption, but that the Son Himself was founded before the world,'
   taking on Him that economy which was for our sake? or how, as the
   Apostle goes on to say, have we an inheritance being predestinated,'
   but that the Lord Himself was founded before the world,' inasmuch as He
   had a purpose, for our sakes, to take on Him through the flesh all that
   inheritance of judgment which lay against us, and we henceforth were
   made sons in Him? and how did we receive it before the world was,' when
   we were not yet in being, but afterwards in time, but that in Christ
   was stored the grace which has reached us? Wherefore also in the
   Judgment, when every one shall receive according to his conduct, He
   says, Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for
   you from the foundation of the world [2734] .' How then, or in whom,
   was it prepared before we came to be, save in the Lord who before the
   world' was founded for this purpose; that we, as built upon Him, might
   partake, as well-compacted stones, the life and grace which is from
   Him? And this took place, as naturally suggests itself to the religious
   mind, that, as I said, we, rising after our brief death, may be capable
   of an eternal life, of which we had not been capable [2735] , men as we
   are, formed of earth, but that before the world' there had been
   prepared for us in Christ the hope of life and salvation. Therefore
   reason is there that the Word, on coming into our flesh, and being
   created in it as a beginning of ways for His works,' is laid as a
   foundation according as the Father's will [2736] was in Him before the
   world, as has been said, and before land was, and before the mountains
   were settled, and before the fountains burst forth; that, though the
   earth and the mountains and the shapes of visible nature pass away in
   the fulness of the present age, we on the contrary may not grow old
   after their pattern, but may be able to live after them, having the
   spiritual life and blessing which before these things have been
   prepared for us in the Word Himself according to election. For thus we
   shall be capable of a life not temporary, but ever afterwards abide
   [2737] and live in Christ; since even before this our life had been
   founded and prepared in Christ Jesus.

   77. Nor in any other way was it fitting that our life should be
   founded, but in the Lord who is before the ages, and through whom the
   ages were brought to be; that, since it was in Him, we too might be
   able to inherit that everlasting life. For God is good; and being good
   always, He willed this, as knowing that our weak nature needed the
   succour and salvation which is from Him. And as a wise architect,
   proposing to build a house, consults also about repairing it, should it
   at any time become dilapidated after building, and, as counselling
   about this, makes preparation and gives to the workmen materials for a
   repair; and thus the means of the repair are provided before the house;
   in the same way prior to us is the repair of our salvation founded in
   Christ, that in Him we might even be new-created. And the will and the
   purpose were made ready before the world,' but have taken effect when
   the need required, and the Saviour came among us. For the Lord Himself
   will stand us in place of all things in the heavens, when He receives
   us into everlasting life. This then suffices to prove that the Word of
   God is not a creature, but that the sense of the passage is right
   [2738] . But since that passage, when scrutinized, has a right sense in
   every point of view, it may be well to state what it is; perhaps many
   words may bring these senseless men to shame. Now here I must recur to
   what has been said before, for what I have to say relates to the same
   proverb and the same Wisdom. The Word has not called Himself a creature
   by nature, but has said in proverbs, The Lord created me;' and He
   plainly indicates a sense not spoken plainly' but latent [2739] , such
   as we shall be able to find by taking away the veil from the proverb.
   For who, on hearing from the Framing Wisdom, The Lord created me a
   beginning of His ways,' does not at once question the meaning,
   reflecting how that creative Wisdom can be created? who on hearing the
   Only-begotten Son of God say, that He was created a beginning of ways,'
   does not investigate the sense, wondering how the Only-begotten Son can
   become a Beginning of many others? for it is a dark saying [2740] ; but
   a man of understanding,' says he, shall understand a proverb and the
   interpretation, the words of the wise and their dark sayings [2741] .'

   78. Now the Only-begotten and very Wisdom [2742] of God is Creator and
   Framer of all things; for in Wisdom hast Thou made them all [2743] ,'
   he says, and the earth is full of Thy creation.' But that what came
   into being might not only be, but be good [2744] , it pleased God that
   His own Wisdom should condescend [2745] to the creatures, so as to
   introduce an impress and semblance of Its Image on all in common and on
   each, that what was made might be manifestly wise works and worthy of
   God [2746] . For as of the Son of God, considered as the Word, our word
   is an image, so of the same Son considered as Wisdom is the wisdom
   which is implanted in us an image; in which wisdom we, having the power
   of knowledge and thought, become recipients of the All-framing Wisdom;
   and through It we are able to know Its Father. For he who hath the
   Son,' saith He, hath the Father also;' and he that receiveth Me,
   receiveth Him that sent Me [2747] .' Such an impress then of Wisdom
   being created in us, and being in all the works, with reason does the
   true and framing Wisdom take to Itself what belongs to its own impress,
   and say, The Lord created me for His works;' for what the wisdom in us
   says, that the Lord Himself speaks as if it were His own; and, whereas
   He is not Himself created, being Creator, yet because of the image of
   Him created in the works [2748] , He says this as if of Himself. And as
   the Lord Himself has said, He that receiveth you, receiveth Me [2749]
   ,' because His impress is in us, so, though He be not among the
   creatures, yet because His image and impress is created in the works,
   He says, as if in His own person, The Lord created me a beginning of
   His ways for His works.' And therefore has this impress of Wisdom in
   the works been brought into being, that, as I said before, the world
   might recognise in it its own Creator the Word, and through Him the
   Father. And this is what Paul said, Because that which may be known of
   God is manifest in them, for God has shewed it unto them: for the
   invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly
   seen, being understood by the things that are made [2750] .' But if so,
   the Word is not a creature in essence [2751] ; but the wisdom which is
   in us and so called, is spoken of in this passage in the Proverbs.

   79. But if this too fails to persuade them, let them tell us
   themselves, whether there is any wisdom in the creatures or not [2752]
   ? If not how is it that the Apostle complains, For after that in the
   Wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God [2753] ?' or how is it
   if there is no wisdom, that a multitude of wise men [2754] ' are found
   in Scripture? for a wise man feareth and departeth from evil [2755] ;'
   and through wisdom is a house builded [2756] ;' and the Preacher says,
   A man's wisdom maketh his face to shine;' and he blames those who are
   headstrong thus, Say not thou, what is the cause that the former days
   were better than these? for thou dost not inquire in wisdom concerning
   this [2757] .' But if, as the Son of Sirach says, He poured her out
   upon all His works; she is with all flesh according to His gift, and He
   hath given her to them that love Him [2758] ,' and this outpouring is a
   note, not of the Essence of the Very [2759] Wisdom and Only-begotten,
   but of that wisdom which is imaged in the world, how is it incredible
   that the All-framing and true Wisdom Itself, whose impress is the
   wisdom and knowledge poured out in the world, should say, as I have
   already explained, as if of Itself, The Lord created me for His works?'
   For the wisdom in the world is not creative, but is that which is
   created in the works, according to which the heavens declare the glory
   of God, and the firmament sheweth His handywork [2760] .' This if men
   have within them [2761] , they will acknowledge the true Wisdom of God;
   and will know that they are made really [2762] after God's Image. And,
   as some son of a king, when the father wished to build a city [2763] ,
   might cause his own name to be printed upon each of the works that were
   rising, both to give security to them of the works remaining, by reason
   of the show of his name on everything, and also to make them remember
   him and his father from the name, and having finished the city might be
   asked concerning it, how it was made, and then would answer, It is made
   securely, for according to the will of my father, I am imaged in each
   work, for my name was made in the works;' but saying this, he does not
   signify that his own essence is created, but the impress of himself by
   means of his name; in the same manner, to apply the illustration, to
   those who admire the wisdom in the creatures, the true Wisdom makes
   answer, The Lord created me for the works,' for my impress is in them;
   and I have thus condescended for the framing of all things.

   80. Moreover, that the Son should be speaking of the impress that is
   within us as if it were Himself, should not startle any one,
   considering (for we must not shrink from repetition [2764] ) that, when
   Saul was persecuting the Church, in which was His impress and image, He
   said, as if He were Himself under persecution, Saul, why persecutest
   thou Me [2765] ?' Therefore (as has been said), as, supposing the
   impress itself of Wisdom which is in the works had said, The Lord
   created me for the works,' no one would have been startled, so, if He,
   the True and Framing Wisdom, the Only-begotten Word of God, should use
   what belongs to His image as about Himself, namely, The Lord created me
   for the works,' let no one, overlooking the wisdom created in the world
   and in the works, think that He created' is said of the Substance of
   the Very [2766] Wisdom, lest, diluting the wine with water [2767] , he
   be judged a defrauder of the truth. For It is Creative and Framer; but
   Its impress is created in the works, as the copy of the image. And He
   says, Beginning of ways,' since such wisdom becomes a sort of
   beginning. and, as it were, rudiments of the knowledge of God; for a
   man entering, as it were, upon this way first, and keeping it in the
   fear of God (as Solomon says [2768] , The fear of the Lord is the
   beginning of wisdom'), then advancing upwards in his thoughts and
   perceiving the Framing Wisdom which is in the creation, will perceive
   in It also Its Father [2769] , as the Lord Himself has said, He that
   hath seen Me, hath seen the Father,' and as John writes, He who
   acknowledgeth the Son, hath the Father also [2770] .' And He says,
   Before the world He founded me [2771] ,' since in Its impress the works
   remain settled and eternal. Then, lest any, hearing concerning the
   wisdom thus created in the works, should think the true Wisdom, God's
   Son, to be by nature a creature, He has found it necessary to add,
   Before the mountains, and before the earth, and before the waters, and
   before all hills He begets me,' that in saying, before every creature'
   (for He includes all the creation under these heads), He may shew that
   He is not created together with the works according to Essence. For if
   He was created for the works,' yet is before them, it follows that He
   is in being before He was created. He is not then a creature by nature
   and essence, but as He Himself has added, an Offspring. But in what
   differs a creature from an offspring, and how it is distinct by nature,
   has been shewn in what has gone before.

   81. But since He proceeds to say, When He prepared the heaven, I was
   present with Him [2772] ,' we ought to know that He says not this as if
   without Wisdom the Father prepared the heaven or the clouds above (for
   there is no room to doubt that all things are created in Wisdom, and
   without It was made not even one [2773] thing); but this is what He
   says, All things took place in Me and through Me, and when there was
   need that Wisdom should be created in the works, in My Essence indeed I
   was with the Father, but by a condescension [2774] to things originate,
   I was disposing over the works My own impress, so that the whole world
   as being in one body, might not be at variance but in concord with
   itself.' All those then who with an upright understanding, according to
   the wisdom given unto them, come to contemplate the creatures, are able
   to say for themselves, By Thy appointment all things continue [2775] ;'
   but they who make light of this must be told, Professing themselves to
   be wise, they became fools;' for that which may be known of God is
   manifest in them; for God has revealed it unto them; for the invisible
   things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being
   perceived by the things that are made, even His eternal Power and
   Godhead, so that they are without excuse. Because that when they knew
   God, they glorified Him not as God, but served the creature more than
   the Creator of all, who is blessed for ever. Amen [2776] .' And they
   will surely be shamed at hearing, For, after that in the wisdom of God
   (in the mode we have explained above), the world by wisdom knew not
   God, it pleased God by the foolishness of the preaching to save them
   that believe [2777] .' For no longer, as in the former times, God has
   willed to be known by an image and shadow of wisdom, that namely which
   is in the creatures, but He has made the true Wisdom Itself to take
   flesh, and to become man, and to undergo the death of the cross; that
   by the faith in Him, henceforth all that believe may obtain salvation.
   However, it is the same Wisdom of God, which through Its own Image in
   the creatures (whence also It is said to be created), first manifested
   Itself, and through Itself Its own Father; and afterwards, being Itself
   the Word, has become flesh [2778] ,' as John says, and after abolishing
   death and saving our race, still more revealed Himself and through Him
   His own Father, saying, Grant unto them that they may know Thee the
   only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent [2779] .'

   82. Hence the whole earth is filled with the knowledge of Him; for the
   knowledge of Father through Son and of Son from Father is one and the
   same, and the Father delights in Him, and in the same joy the Son
   rejoices in the Father, saying, I was by Him, daily His delight,
   rejoicing always before Him [2780] .' And this again proves that the
   Son is not foreign, but proper to the Father's Essence. For behold, not
   because of us has He come to be, as the irreligious men say, nor is He
   out of nothing (for not from without did God procure for Himself a
   cause of rejoicing), but the words denote what is His own and like.
   When then was it, when the Father rejoiced not? but if He ever
   rejoiced, He was ever, in whom He rejoiced. And in whom does the Father
   rejoice, except as seeing Himself in His own Image, which is His Word?
   And though in sons of men also He had delight, on finishing the world,
   as it is written in these same Proverbs [2781] , yet this too has a
   consistent sense. For even thus He had delight, not because joy was
   added to Him, but again on seeing the works made after His own Image;
   so that even this rejoicing of God is on account of His Image. And how
   too has the Son delight, except as seeing Himself in the Father? for
   this is the same as saying, He that hath seen Me, hath seen the
   Father,' and I am in the Father and the Father in Me [2782] .' Vain
   then is your vaunt as is on all sides shewn, O Christ's enemies, and
   vainly did ye parade [2783] and circulate everywhere your text, The
   Lord created me a beginning of His ways,' perverting its sense, and
   publishing, not Solomon's meaning, but your own comment [2784] . For
   behold your sense is proved to be but a fantasy; but the passage in the
   Proverbs, as well as all that is above said, proves that the Son is not
   a creature in nature and essence, but the proper Offspring of the
   Father, true Wisdom and Word, by whom all things were made,' and
   without Him was made not one thing. [2785] '

   Discourse III.

   ------------------------

   Chapter XXIII.--Texts Explained; Seventhly, John xiv. 10 Introduction.
   The doctrine of the coinherence. The Father and the Son Each whole and
   perfect God. They are in Each Other, because their Essence is One and
   the Same. They are Each Perfect and have One Essence, because the
   Second Person is the Son of the First. Asterius's evasive explanation
   of the text under review; refuted. Since the Son has all that the
   Father has, He is His Image; and the Father is the One God, because the
   Son is in the Father.

   1. The Ario-maniacs, as it appears, having once made up their minds to
   transgress and revolt from the Truth, are strenuous in appropriating
   the words of Scripture, When the impious cometh into a depth of evils,
   he despiseth [2786] ;' for refutation does not stop them, nor
   perplexity abash them; but, as having a whore's forehead,' they refuse
   to be ashamed [2787] ' before all men in their irreligion. For whereas
   the passages which they alleged, The Lord created me [2788] ,' and Made
   better than the Angels [2789] ,' and First-born [2790] ,' and Faithful
   to Him that made Him [2791] ' have a right sense [2792] , and inculcate
   religiousness towards Christ, so it is that these men still, as if
   bedewed with the serpent's poison, not seeing what they ought to see,
   nor understanding what they read, as if in vomit from the depth of
   their irreligious heart, have next proceeded to disparage our Lord's
   words, I in the Father and the Father in Me [2793] ;' saying, How can
   the One be contained in the Other and the Other in the One?' or How at
   all can the Father who is the greater be contained in the Son who is
   the less?' or What wonder, if the Son is in the Father,' considering it
   is written even of us, In Him we live and move and have our being
   [2794] ?' And this state of mind is consistent with their perverseness,
   who think God to be material, and understand not what is True Father'
   and True Son,' nor Light Invisible' and Eternal,' and Its Radiance
   Invisible,' nor Invisible Subsistence,' and Immaterial Expression' and
   Immaterial Image.' For did they know, they would not dishonour and
   ridicule the Lord of glory, nor interpreting things immaterial after a
   material manner, pervert good words. It were sufficient indeed, on
   hearing only words which are the Lord's, at once to believe, since the
   faith of simplicity is better than an elaborate process of persuasion;
   but since they have endeavoured to profane even this passage to their
   own heresy, it becomes necessary to expose their perverseness and to
   shew the mind of the truth, at least for the security of the faithful.
   For when it is said, I in the Father and the Father in Me,' They are
   not therefore, as these suppose, discharged into Each Other, filling
   the One the Other, as in the case of empty vessels, so that the Son
   fills the emptiness of the Father and the Father that of the Son [2795]
   , and Each of Them by Himself is not complete and perfect (for this is
   proper to bodies, and therefore the mere assertion of it is full of
   irreligion), for the Father is full and perfect, and the Son is the
   Fulness of Godhead. Nor again, as God, by coming into the Saints,
   strengthens them, thus is He also in the Son. For He is Himself the
   Father's Power and Wisdom, and by partaking of Him things originate are
   sanctified in the Spirit; but the Son Himself is not Son by
   participation, but is the Father's own Offspring [2796] . Nor again is
   the Son in the Father, in the sense of the passage, In Him we live and
   move and have our being;' for, He as being from the Fount [2797] of the
   Father is the Life, in which all things are both quickened and consist;
   for the Life does not live in life [2798] , else it would not be Life,
   but rather He gives life to all things.

   2. But now let us see what Asterius the Sophist says, the retained
   pleader [2799] for the heresy. In imitation then of the Jews so far, he
   writes as follows; It is very plain that He has said, that He is in the
   Father and the Father again in Him, for this reason, that neither the
   word on which He was discoursing is, as He says, His own, but the
   Father's, nor the works belong to Him, but to the Father who gave Him
   the power.' Now this, if uttered at random by a little child, had been
   excused from his age; but when one who bears the title of Sophist, and
   professes universal knowledge [2800] , is the writer, what a serious
   condemnation does he deserve! And does he not shew himself a stranger
   to the Apostle [2801] , as being puffed up with persuasive words of
   wisdom, and thinking thereby to succeed in deceiving, not understanding
   himself what he says nor whereof he affirms [2802] ? For what the Son
   has said as proper and suitable to a Son only, who is Word and Wisdom
   and Image of the Father's Essence, that he levels to all the creatures,
   and makes common to the Son and to them; and he says, lawless [2803]
   man, that the Power of the Father receives power, that from this his
   irreligion it may follow to say that in a son [2804] the Son was made a
   son, and the Word received a word's authority; and, far from granting
   that He spoke this as a Son, He ranks Him with all things made as
   having learned it as they have. For if the Son said, I am in the Father
   and the Father in Me,' because His discourses were not His own words
   but the Father's, and so of His works, then,--since David says, I will
   hear what the Lord God shall say in me [2805] ,' and again Solomon
   [2806] , My words are spoken by God,' and since Moses was minister of
   words which were from God, and each of the Prophets spoke not what was
   his own but what was from God, Thus saith the Lord,' and since the
   works of the Saints, as they professed, were not their own but God's
   who gave the power, Elijah for instance and Elisha invoking God that He
   Himself would raise the dead, and Elisha saying to Naaman, on cleansing
   him from the leprosy, that thou mayest know that there is a God in
   Israel [2807] ,' and Samuel too in the days of the harvest praying to
   God to grant rain, and the Apostles saying that not in their own power
   they did miracles but in the Lord's grace--it is plain that, according
   to Asterius such a statement must be common to all, so that each of
   them is able to say, I in the Father and the Father in me;' and as a
   consequence that He is no longer one Son of God and Word and Wisdom,
   but, as others, is only one out of many.

   3. But if the Lord said this, His words would not rightly have been, I
   in the Father and the Father in Me,' but rather, I too am in the
   Father, and the Father is in Me too,' that He may have nothing of His
   own and by prerogative [2808] , relatively to the Father, as a Son, but
   the same grace in common with all. But it is not so, as they think; for
   not understanding that He is genuine Son from the Father, they belie
   Him who is such, whom alone it befits to say, I in the Father and the
   Father in Me.' For the Son is in the Father, as it is allowed us to
   know, because the whole Being of the Son is proper to the Father's
   essence [2809] , as radiance from light, and stream from fountain; so
   that whoso sees the Son, sees what is proper to the Father, and knows
   that the Son's Being, because from the Father, is therefore in the
   Father. For the Father is in the Son, since the Son is what is from the
   Father and proper to Him, as in the radiance the sun, and in the word
   the thought, and in the stream the fountain: for whoso thus
   contemplates the Son, contemplates what is proper to the Father's
   Essence, and knows that the Father is in the Son. For whereas the Form
   [2810] and Godhead of the Father is the Being of the Son, it follows
   that the Son is in the Father and the Father in the Son [2811] .

   4. On this account and reasonably, having said before, I and the Father
   are One,' He added, I in the Father and the Father in Me, [2812] ' by
   way of shewing the identity [2813] of Godhead and the unity of Essence.
   For they are one, not [2814] as one thing divided into two parts, and
   these nothing but one, nor as one thing twice named, so that the Same
   becomes at one time Father, at another His own Son, for this Sabellius
   holding was judged an heretic. But They are two, because the Father is
   Father and is not also Son, and the Son is Son and not also Father
   [2815] ; but the nature is one; (for the offspring is not unlike [2816]
   its parent, for it is his image), and all that is the Father's, is the
   Son's [2817] . Wherefore neither is the Son another God, for He was not
   procured from without, else were there many, if a godhead be procured
   foreign from the Father's [2818] ; for if the Son be other, as an
   Offspring, still He is the Same as God; and He and the Father are one
   in propriety and peculiarity of nature, and in the identity of the one
   Godhead, as has been said. For the radiance also is light, not second
   to the sun, nor a different light, nor from participation of it, but a
   whole and proper offspring of it. And such an offspring is necessarily
   one light; and no one would say that they are two lights [2819] , but
   sun and radiance two, yet one the light from the sun enlightening in
   its radiance all things. So also the Godhead of the Son is the
   Father's; whence also it is indivisible; and thus there is one God and
   none other but He. And so, since they are one, and the Godhead itself
   one, the same things are said of the Son, which are said of the Father,
   except His being said to be Father [2820] :--for instance [2821] , that
   He is God, And the Word was God [2822] ;' Almighty, Thus saith He which
   was and is and is to come, the Almighty [2823] ;' Lord, One Lord Jesus
   Christ [2824] ;' that He is Light, I am the Light [2825] ;' that He
   wipes out sins, that ye may know,' He says, that the Son of man hath
   power upon earth to forgive sins [2826] ;' and so with other
   attributes. For all things,' says the Son Himself, whatsoever the
   Father hath, are Mine [2827] ;' and again, And Mine are Thine.'

   5. And on hearing the attributes of the Father spoken of a Son, we
   shall thereby see the Father in the Son; and we shall contemplate the
   Son in the Father, when what is said of the Son is said of the Father
   also. And why are the attributes of the Father ascribed to the Son,
   except that the Son is an Offspring from Him? and why are the Son's
   attributes proper to the Father, except again because the Son is the
   proper Offspring of His Essence? And the Son, being the proper
   Offspring of the Father's Essence, reasonably says that the Father's
   attributes are His own also; whence suitably and consistently with
   saying, I and the Father are One,' He adds, that ye may know that I am
   in the Father and the Father in Me [2828] .' Moreover, He has added
   this again, He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father [2829] ;' and
   there is one and the same sense in these three [2830] passages. For he
   who in this sense understands that the Son and the Father are one,
   knows that He is in the Father and the Father in the Son; for the
   Godhead of the Son is the Father's, and it is in the Son; and whoso
   enters into this, is convinced that He that hath seen the Son, hath
   seen the Father;' for in the Son is contemplated the Father's Godhead.
   And we may perceive this at once from the illustration of the Emperor's
   image. For in the image is the shape and form of the Emperor, and in
   the Emperor is that shape which is in the image. For the likeness of
   the Emperor in the image is exact [2831] ; so that a person who looks
   at the image, sees in it the Emperor; and he again who sees the
   Emperor, recognises that it is he who is in the image [2832] . And from
   the likeness not differing, to one who after the image wished to view
   the Emperor, the image might say, I and the Emperor are one; for I am
   in him, and he in me; and what thou seest in me, that thou beholdest in
   him, and what thou hast seen in him, that thou holdest in me [2833] .'
   Accordingly he who worships the image, in it worships the Emperor also;
   for the image is his form and appearance. Since then the Son too is the
   Father's Image, it must necessarily be understood that the Godhead and
   propriety of the Father is the Being of the Son.

   6. And this is what is said, Who being in the form of God [2834] ,' and
   the Father in Me.' Nor is this Form [2835] of the Godhead partial
   merely, but the fulness of the Father's Godhead is the Being of the
   Son, and the Son is whole God. Therefore also, being equal to God, He
   thought it not a prize to be equal to God;' and again since the Godhead
   and the Form of the Son is none other's than the Father's [2836] , this
   is what He says, I in the Father.' Thus God was in Christ reconciling
   the world unto Himself [2837] ;' for the propriety of the Father's
   Essence is that Son, in whom the creation was then reconciled with God.
   Thus what things the Son then wrought are the Father's works, for the
   Son is the Form of that Godhead of the Father, which wrought the works.
   And thus he who looks at the Son, sees the Father; for in the Father's
   Godhead is and is contemplated the Son; and the Father's Form which is
   in Him shews in Him the Father; and thus the Father is in the Son. And
   that propriety and Godhead which is from the Father in the Son, shews
   the Son in the Father, and His inseparability from Him; and whoso hears
   and beholds that what is said of the Father is also said of the Son,
   not as accruing to His Essence by grace or participation, but because
   the very Being of the Son is the proper Offspring of the Father's
   Essence, will fitly understand the words, as I said before, I in the
   Father, and the Father in Me;' and I and the Father are One [2838] .'
   For the Son is such as the Father is, because He has all that is the
   Father's. Wherefore also is He implied together with the Father. For, a
   son not being, one cannot say father; whereas when we call God a Maker,
   we do not of necessity intimate the things which have come to be; for a
   maker is before his works [2839] . But when we call God Father, at once
   with the Father we signify the Son's existence. Therefore also he who
   believes in the Son, believes also in the Father: for he believes in
   what is proper to the Father's Essence; and thus the faith is one in
   one God. And he who worships and honours the Son, in the Son worships
   and honours the Father; for one is the Godhead; and therefore one
   [2840] the honour and one the worship which is paid to the Father in
   and through the Son. And he who thus worships, worships one God; for
   there is one God and none other than He. Accordingly when the Father is
   called the only God, and we read that there is one God [2841] , and I
   am,' and beside Me there is no God,' and I the first and I the last
   [2842] ,' this has a fit meaning. For God is One and Only and First;
   but this is not said to the denial of the Son [2843] , perish the
   thought; for He is in that One, and First and Only, as being of that
   One and Only and First the Only Word and Wisdom and Radiance. And He
   too is the First, as the Fulness of the Godhead of the First and Only,
   being whole and full God [2844] . This then is not said on His account,
   but to deny that there is other such as the Father and His Word.

   perichoresis, which this objection introduces, is the test of orthodoxy
   opposed to Arianism. Cf. de Syn. 15, n. 4. This is seen clearly in the
   case of Eusebius, whose language approaches to Catholic more nearly
   than Arians in general. After all his strong assertions, the question
   recurs, is our Lord a distinct being from God, as we are, or not? he
   answers in the affirmative, vid. supr. p. 75, n. 7, whereas we believe
   that He is literally and numerically one with the Father, and therefore
   His Person dwells in the Father's Person by an ineffable union. And
   hence the language of Dionysius [of Rome] supr. de Decr. 26. the Holy
   Ghost must repose and habitate in God,' emphilochorein to theo kai
   endiaitasthai. And hence the strong figure of S. Jerome (in which he is
   followed by S. Cyril, Thesaur. p. 51), Filius locus est Patris, sicut
   et Pater locus est Filii.' in Ezek. iii. 12. So Athan. contrasts the
   creatures who are en memerismenois topois and the Son. Serap. iii. 4.
   Cf. even in the Macrostich Creed, language of this character, viz. All
   the Father embosoming the Son, and all the Son hanging and adhering to
   the Father, and alone resting on the Father's breast continually.' De
   Syn. 26 (7), where vid. note 3.

   [2795] This is not inconsistent with S. Jerome as quoted in the
   foregoing note. Athan. merely means that such illustrations cannot be
   taken literally, as if spoken of natural subjects. The Father is the
   topos or locus of the Son, because when we contemplate the Son in His
   fulness as holos theos, we merely view the Father as that Person in
   whom God the Son is; our mind abstracts His Essence which is the Son
   for the moment from Him, and regards Him merely as Father. Thus in
   Illud. Omn. 4, supr. p. 89. It is, however, but an operation of the
   mind, and not a real emptying of Godhead from the Father, if such words
   may be used. Father and Son are both the same God, though really and
   eternally distinct from each other; and Each is full of the Other, that
   is, their Essence is one and the same. This is insisted on by S. Cyril,
   in Joan. p. 28. And by S. Hilary, Trin. vii. fin. vid. also iii. 23.

   [2809] Since the Father and the Son are the numerically One God, it is
   but expressing this in other words to say that the Father is in the Son
   and the Son in the Father, for all They have and all They are is common
   to Each, excepting Their being Father and Son. A perichoresis of
   Persons is implied in the Unity of Essence. This is the connexion of
   the two texts so often quoted; the Son is in the Father and the Father
   in the Son,' because the Son and the Father are one.' And the cause of

   [2833] Athanasius guards against what is defective in this illustration
   in the next chapter, but independent of such explanation a mistake as

   instance of the imperfect and partial character of all illustrations of
   the Divine Mystery. What it is taken to symbolize is the unity of the
   Father and Son, for the Image is not a Second Emperor but the same.
   vid. Sabell. Greg. 6. But no one, who bowed before the Emperor's Statue
   can be supposed to have really worshipped it; whereas our Lord is the
   Object of supreme worship, which terminates in Him, as being really one
   with Him whose Image He is. From the custom of paying honour to the
   Imperial Statues, the Cultus Imaginum was introduced into the Eastern
   Church. The Western Church, not having had the civil custom, resisted.

   Chapter XXIV.--Texts Explained; Eighthly, John xvii. 3. and the Like.
   Our Lord's divinity cannot interfere with His Father's prerogatives, as
   the One God, which were so earnestly upheld by the Son. One' is used in
   contrast to false gods and idols, not to the Son, through whom the
   Father spoke. Our Lord adds His Name to the Father's, as included in
   Him. The Father the First, not as if the Son were not First too, but as
   Origin.

   7. Now that this is the sense of the Prophet is clear and manifest to
   all; but since the irreligious men, alleging such passages also,
   dishonour the Lord and reproach us, saying, Behold God is said to be
   One and Only and First; how say ye that the Son is God? for if He were
   God, He had not said, "I Alone," nor "God is One [2845] ;"' it is
   necessary to declare the sense of these phrases in addition, as far as
   we can, that all may know from this also that the Arians are really
   contending with God [2846] . If there then is rivalry of the Son
   towards the Father, then be such words uttered against Him; and if
   according to what is said to David concerning Adonijah and Absalom
   [2847] , so also the Father looks upon the Son, then let Him utter and
   urge such words against Himself, lest He the Son, calling Himself God,
   make any to revolt from the Father. But if he who knows the Son, on the
   contrary, knows the Father, the Son Himself revealing Him to him, and
   in the Word he shall rather see the Father, as has been said, and if
   the Son on coming, glorified not Himself but the Father, saying to one
   who came to Him, Why callest thou Me good? none is good save One, that
   is, God [2848] ;' and to one who asked, what was the great commandment
   in the Law, answering, Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is One Lord
   [2849] ;' and saying to the multitudes, I came down from heaven, not to
   do My own will, but the will of Him that sent Me [2850] ;' and teaching
   the disciples, My Father is greater than I,' and He that honoureth Me,
   honoureth Him that sent Me [2851] ;' if the Son is such towards His own
   Father, what is the difficulty [2852] , that one must need take such a
   view of such passages? and on the other hand, if the Son is the
   Father's Word, who is so wild, besides these Christ-opposers, as to
   think that God has thus spoken, as traducing and denying His own Word?
   This is not the mind of Christians; perish the thought; for not with
   reference to the Son is it thus written, but for the denial of those
   falsely called gods, invented by men.

   8. And this account of the meaning of such passages is satisfactory;
   for since those who are devoted to gods falsely so called, revolt from
   the True God, therefore God, being good and careful for mankind,
   recalling the wanderers, says, I am Only God,' and I Am,' and Besides
   Me there is no God,' and the like; that He may condemn things which are
   not, and may convert all men to Himself. And as, supposing in the
   daytime when the sun was shining, a man were rudely to paint a piece of
   wood, which had not even the appearance of light, and call that image
   the cause of light, and if the sun with regard to it were to say, I
   alone am the light of the day, and there is no other light of the day
   but I,' he would say this, with regard, not to his own radiance, but to
   the error arising from the wooden image and the dissimilitude of that
   vain representation; so it is with I am,' and I am Only God,' and There
   is none other besides Me,' viz. that He may make men renounce falsely
   called gods, and that they may recognise Him the true God instead.
   Indeed when God said this, He said it through His own Word, unless
   forsooth the modern [2853] Jews add this too, that He has not said this
   through His Word; but so hath He spoken, though they rave, these
   followers of the devil [2854] . For the Word of the Lord came to the
   Prophet, and this was what was heard; nor is there a thing which God
   says or does, but He says and does it in the Word. Not then with
   reference to Him is this said, O Christ's enemies, but to things
   foreign to Him and not from [2855] Him. For according to the aforesaid
   illustration, if the sun had spoken those words, he would have been
   setting right the error and have so spoken, not as having his radiance
   without him, but in the radiance shewing his own light. Therefore not
   for the denial of the Son, nor with reference to Him, are such
   passages, but to the overthrow of falsehood. Accordingly God spoke not
   such words to Adam at the beginning, though His Word was with Him, by
   whom all things came to be; for there was no need, before idols came
   in; but when men made insurrection against the truth and named for
   themselves gods such as they would [2856] , then it was that need arose
   of such words, for the denial of gods that were not. Nay I would add,
   that they were said even in anticipation of the folly of these
   Christ-opposers [2857] , that they might know, that whatsoever god they
   devise external to the Father's Essence, he is not True God, nor Image
   and Son of the Only and First.

   9. If then the Father be called the only true God, this is said not to
   the denial of Him who said, I am the Truth [2858] ,' but of those on
   the other hand who by nature are not true, as the Father and His Word
   are. And hence the Lord Himself added at once, And Jesus Christ whom
   Thou didst send [2859] .' Now had He been a creature, He would not have
   added this, and ranked Himself with His Creator (for what fellowship is
   there between the True and the not true?); but as it is, by adding
   Himself to the Father, He has shewn that He is of the Father's nature;
   and He has given us to know that of the True Father He is True
   Offspring. And John too, as he had learned [2860] , so he teaches this,
   writing in his Epistle, And we are in the True, even in His Son Jesus
   Christ; This is the True God and eternal life [2861] .' And when the
   Prophet says concerning the creation, That stretcheth forth the heavens
   alone [2862] ,' and when God says, I only stretch out the heavens,' it
   is made plain to every one, that in the Only is signified also the Word
   of the Only, in whom all things were made,' and without whom was made
   not one thing.' Therefore, if they were made through the Word, and yet
   He says, I Only,' and together with that Only is understood the Son,
   through whom the heavens were made, so also then, if it be said, One
   God,' and I Only,' and I the First,' in that One and Only and First is
   understood the Word coexisting, as in the Light the Radiance. And this
   can be understood of no other than the Word alone. For all other things
   subsisted out of nothing through the Son, and are greatly different in
   nature; but the Son Himself is natural and true Offspring from the
   Father; and thus the very passage which these insensates have thought
   fit to adduce, I the First,' in defence of their heresy, doth rather
   expose their perverse spirit. For God says, I the First and I the
   Last;' if then, as though ranked with the things after Him, He is said
   to be first of them, so that they come next to Him, then certainly you
   will have shewn that He Himself precedes the works in time only [2863]
   ; which, to go no further, is extreme irreligion; but if it is in order
   to prove that He is not from any, nor any before Him, but that He is
   Origin and Cause of all things, and to destroy the Gentile fables, that
   He has said I the First,' it is plain also, that when the Son is called
   First-born, this is done not for the sake of ranking Him with the
   creation, but to prove the framing and adoption of all things [2864]
   through the Son. For as the Father is First, so also is He both First
   [2865] , as Image of the First, and because the First is in Him, and
   also Offspring from the Father, in whom the whole creation is created
   and adopted into sonship.

   [2864] ii. 62, n. 2.

   [2865] It is no inconsistency to say that the Father is first, and the
   Son first also, for comparison or number does not enter into mystery.
   Since Each is holos theos, Each, as contemplated by our finite reason,
   at the moment of contemplation excludes the Other. Though we say' Three
   Persons, Person hardly denotes one abstract idea,' certainly not as
   containing under it three individual subjects, but it is a term'
   applied to the One God in three ways. It is the doctrine of the
   Fathers, that, though we use words expressive of a Trinity, yet that
   God is beyond number, and that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, though
   eternally distinct from each other, can scarcely be viewed together in
   common, except as One' substance, as if they could not be generalized
   into Three Any whatever; and as if it were, strictly speaking,
   incorrect to speak of a' Person, or otherwise than of the' Person,
   whether of Father, or of Son, or of Spirit. The question has almost
   been admitted by S. Austin, whether it is not possible to say that God
   is One' Person (Trin. vii. 8), for He is wholly and entirely Father,
   and at the same time wholly and entirely Son, and wholly and entirely
   Holy Ghost. Some references to the Fathers shall be given on that
   subject, infr. 36 fin. vid. also supr. Â§6, n. 11. Meanwhile the
   doctrine here stated will account for such expressions as God from
   God,' i.e. the One God (who is the Son) from the One God (who is the
   Father); vid. supr. de Syn. 52, note 8. Again, he ousia haute tes

   Chapter XXV.--Texts Explained; Ninthly, John x. 30; xvii. 11, &c. Arian
   explanation, that the Son is one with the Father in will and judgment;
   but so are all good men, nay things inanimate; contrast of the Son.
   Oneness between Them is in nature, because oneness in operation. Angels
   not objects of prayer, because they do not work together with God, but
   the Son; texts quoted. Seeing an Angel, is not seeing God. Arians in
   fact hold two Gods, and tend to Gentile polytheism. Arian explanation
   that the Father and Son are one as we are one with Christ, is put aside
   by the Regula Fidei, and shewn invalid by the usage of Scripture in
   illustrations; the true force of the comparison; force of the terms
   used. Force of in us;' force of as;' confirmed by S. John. In what
   sense we are in God' and His sons.'

   10. However here too they introduce their private fictions, and contend
   that the Son and the Father are not in such wise one,' or like,' as the
   Church preaches, but, as they themselves would have it [2866] . For
   they say, since what the Father wills, the Son wills also, and is not
   contrary either in what He thinks or in what He judges, but is in all
   respects concordant [2867] with Him, declaring doctrines which are the
   same, and a word consistent and united with the Father's teaching,
   therefore it is that He and the Father are One; and some of them have
   dared to write as well as say this [2868] . Now what can be more
   unseemly or irrational than this? for if therefore the Son and the
   Father are One and if in this way the Word is like the Father, it
   follows forthwith [2869] that the Angels [2870] too, and the other
   beings above us, Powers and Authorities, and Thrones and Dominions, and
   what we see, Sun and Moon, and the Stars, should be sons also, as the
   Son; and that it should be said of them too, that they and the Father
   are one, and that each is God's Image and Word. For what God wills,
   that will they; and neither in judging nor in doctrine are they
   discordant, but in all things are obedient to their Maker. For they
   would not have remained in their own glory, unless, what the Father
   willed, that they had willed also. He, for instance, who did not
   remain, but went astray, heard the words, How art thou fallen from
   heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning [2871] ?' But if this be so, how
   is only He Only-begotten Son and Word and Wisdom? or how, whereas so
   many are like the Father, is He only an Image? for among men too will
   be found many like the Father, numbers, for instance, of martyrs, and
   before them the Apostles and Prophets, and again before them the
   Patriarchs. And many now too keep the Saviour's command, being merciful
   as their Father which is in heaven [2872] ,' and observing the
   exhortation, Be ye therefore followers of God as dear children, and
   walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us [2873] ;' many too have
   become followers of Paul as he also of Christ [2874] . And yet no one
   of these is Word or Wisdom or Only-begotten Son or Image; nor did any
   one of them make bold to say, I and the Father are One,' or, I in the
   Father, and the Father in Me [2875] ;' but it is said of all of them,
   Who is like unto Thee among the gods, O Lord? and who shall be likened
   to the Lord among the sons of Gods [2876] ?' and of Him on the contrary
   that He only is Image true and natural of the Father. For though we
   have been made after the Image [2877] , and called both image and glory
   of God, yet not on our own account still, but for that Image and true
   Glory of God inhabiting us, which is His Word, who was for us
   afterwards made flesh, have we this grace of our designation.

   11. This their notion then being evidently unseemly and irrational as
   well as the rest, the likeness and the oneness must be referred to the
   very Essence of the Son; for unless it be so taken, He will not be
   shown to have anything beyond things originate, as has been said, nor
   will He be like the Father, but He will be like the Father's doctrines;
   and He differs from the Father, in that the Father is Father [2878] ,
   but the doctrines and teaching are the Father's. If then in respect to
   the doctrines and the teaching the Son is like the Father, then the
   Father according to them will be Father in name only, and the Son will
   not be an exact Image, or rather will be seen to have no propriety at
   all or likeness of the Father; for what likeness or propriety has he
   who is so utterly different from the Father? for Paul taught like the
   Saviour, yet was not like Him in essence [2879] .' Having then such
   notions, they speak falsely; whereas the Son and the Father are one in
   such wise as has been said, and in such wise is the Son like the Father
   Himself and from Him, as we may see and understand son to be towards
   father, and as we may see the radiance towards the sun. Such then being
   the Son, therefore when the Son works, the Father is the Worker [2880]
   , and the Son coming to the Saints, the Father is He who cometh in the
   Son [2881] , as He promised when He said, I and My Father will come,
   and will make Our abode with him [2882] ;' for in the Image is
   contemplated the Father, and in the Radiance is the Light. Therefore
   also, as we said just now, when the Father gives grace and peace, the
   Son also gives it, as Paul signifies in every Epistle, writing, Grace
   to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.' For
   one and the same grace is from the Father in the Son, as the light of
   the sun and of the radiance is one, and as the sun's illumination is
   effected through the radiance; and so too when he prays for the
   Thessalonians, in saying, Now God Himself even our Father, and the Lord
   Jesus Christ, may He direct our way unto you [2883] ,' he has guarded
   the unity of the Father and of the Son. For he has not said, May they
   direct,' as if a double grace were given from two Sources, This and
   That, but May He direct,' to shew that the Father gives it through the
   Son;--at which these irreligious ones will not blush, though they well
   might.

   12. For if there were no unity, nor the Word the own Offspring of the
   Father's Essence, as the radiance of the light, but the Son were
   divided in nature from the Father, it were sufficient that the Father
   alone should give, since none of originate things is a partner with his
   Maker in His givings; but, as it is, such a mode of giving shews the
   oneness of the Father and the Son. No one, for instance, would pray to
   receive from God and the Angels [2884] , or from any other creature,
   nor would any one say, May God and the Angel give thee;' but from
   Father and the Son, because of Their oneness and the oneness of Their
   giving. For through the Son is given what is given; and there is
   nothing but the Father operates it through the Son; for thus is grace
   secure to him who receives it. And if the Patriarch Jacob, blessing his
   grandchildren Ephraim and Manasses, said, God which fed me all my life
   long unto this day, the Angel which delivered me from all evil, bless
   the lads [2885] ,' yet none of created and natural Angels did he join
   to God their Creator, nor rejecting God that fed him, did he from Angel
   ask the blessing on his grandsons; but in saying, Who delivered me from
   all evil,' he shewed that it was no created Angel, but the Word of God,
   whom he joined to the Father in his prayer, through whom, whomsoever He
   will, God doth deliver. For knowing that He is also called the Father's
   Angel of great Counsel [2886] ,' he said that none other than He was
   the Giver of blessing, and Deliverer from evil. Nor was it that he
   desired a blessing for himself from God but for his grandchildren from
   the Angel, but whom He Himself had besought saying, I will not let Thee
   go except Thou bless me [2887] ' (for that was God, as he says himself,
   I have seen God face to face'), Him he prayed to bless also the sons of
   Joseph. It is proper then to an Angel to minister at the command of
   God, and often does he go forth to cast out the Amorite, and is sent to
   guard the people in the way; but these are not his doings, but of God
   who commanded and sent him, whose also it is to deliver, whom He will
   deliver. Therefore it was no other than the Lord God Himself whom he
   had seen, who said to him, And behold I am with thee, to guard thee in
   all the way whither thou [2888] goest;' and it was no other than God
   whom he had seen, who kept Laban from his treachery, ordering him not
   to speak evil words to Jacob; and none other than God did he himself
   beseech, saying, Rescue me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I fear
   him [2889] ;' for in conversation too with his wives he said, God hath
   not suffered Laban to injure me.'

   13. Therefore it was none other than God Himself that David too
   besought concerning his deliverance, When I was in trouble, I called
   upon the Lord, and He heard me; deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying
   lips and from a deceitful tongue [2890] .' To Him also giving thanks he
   spoke the words of the Song in the seventeenth Psalm, in the day in
   which the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from
   the hand of Saul, saying, I will love Thee, O Lord my strength; the
   Lord is my strong rock and my defence and deliverer [2891] .' And Paul,
   after enduring many persecutions, to none other than God gave thanks,
   saying, Out of them all the Lord delivered me; and He will deliver in
   Whom we trust [2892] .' And none other than God blessed Abraham and
   Isaac; and Isaac praying for Jacob, said, May God bless thee and
   increase thee and multiply thee, and thou shalt be for many companies
   of nations, and may He give thee the blessing of Abraham my father
   [2893] .' But if it belong to none other than God to bless and to
   deliver, and none other was the deliverer of Jacob than the Lord
   Himself and Him that delivered him the Patriarch besought for his
   grandsons, evidently none other did he join to God in his prayer, than
   God's Word, whom therefore he called Angel, because it is He alone who
   reveals the Father. Which the Apostle also did when he said, Grace unto
   you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ [2894] .'
   For thus the blessing was secure, because of the Son's indivisibility
   from the Father, and for that the grace given by Them is one and the
   same. For though the Father gives it, through the Son is the gift; and
   though the Son be said to vouchsafe it, it is the Father who supplies
   it through and in the Son; for I thank my God,' says the Apostle
   writing to the Corinthians, always on your behalf, for the grace of God
   which is given you in Christ Jesus [2895] .' And this one may see in
   the instance of light and radiance; for what the light enlightens, that
   the radiance irradiates; and what the radiance irradiates, from the
   light is its enlightenment. So also when the Son is beheld, so is the
   Father, for He is the Father's radiance; and thus the Father and the
   Son are one.

   14. But this is not so with things originate and creatures; for when
   the Father works, it is not that any Angel works, or any other
   creature; for none of these is an efficient cause [2896] , but they are
   of things which come to be; and moreover being separate and divided
   from the only God, and other in nature, and being works, they can
   neither work what God works, nor, as I said before, when God gives
   grace, can they give grace with Him. Nor, on seeing an Angel would a
   man say that he had seen the Father; for Angels, as it is written, are
   ministering spirits sent forth to minister [2897] ,' and are heralds of
   gifts given by Him through the Word to those who receive them. And the
   Angel on his appearance, himself confesses that he has been sent by his
   Lord; as Gabriel confessed in the case of Zacharias, and also in the
   case of Mary, bearer of God [2898] . And he who beholds a vision of
   Angels, knows that he has seen the Angel and not God. For Zacharias saw
   an Angel; and Isaiah saw the Lord. Manoah, the father of Samson, saw an
   Angel; but Moses beheld God. Gideon saw an Angel, but to Abraham
   appeared God. And neither he who saw God, beheld an Angel, nor he who
   saw an Angel, considered that he saw God; for greatly, or rather
   wholly, do things by nature originate differ from God the Creator. But
   if at any time, when the Angel was seen, he who saw it heard God's
   voice, as took place at the bush; for the Angel of the Lord was seen in
   a flame of fire out of the bush, and the Lord called Moses out of the
   bush, saying, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham and the
   God of Isaac and the God of Jacob [2899] ,' yet was not the Angel the
   God of Abraham, but in the Angel God spoke. And what was seen was an
   Angel; but God spoke in him [2900] . For as He spoke to Moses in the
   pillar of a cloud in the tabernacle, so also God appears and speaks in
   Angels. So again to the son of Nun He spake by an Angel. But what God
   speaks, it is very plain He speaks through the Word, and not through
   another. And the Word, as being not separate from the Father, nor
   unlike and foreign to the Father's Essence, what He works, those are
   the Father's works, and His framing of all things is one with His; and
   what the Son gives, that is the Father's gift. And he who hath seen the
   Son, knows that, in seeing Him, he has seen, not Angel, nor one merely
   greater than Angels, nor in short any creature, but the Father Himself.
   And he who hears the Word, knows that he hears the Father; as he who is
   irradiated by the radiance, knows that he is enlightened by the sun.

   15. For divine Scripture wishing us thus to understand the matter, has
   given such illustrations, as we have said above, from which we are able
   both to press the traitorous Jews, and to refute the allegation of
   Gentiles who maintain and think, on account of the Trinity, that we
   profess many gods [2901] . For, as the illustration shows, we do not
   introduce three Origins or three Fathers, as the followers of Marcion
   and ManichÃ¦us; since we have not suggested the image of three suns, but
   sun and radiance. And one is the light from the sun in the radiance;
   and so we know of but one origin; and the All-framing Word we profess
   to have no other manner of godhead, than that of the Only God, because
   He is born from Him. Rather then will the Ario-maniacs with reason
   incur the charge of polytheism or else of atheism [2902] , because they
   idly talk of the Son as external and a creature, and again the Spirit
   as from nothing. For either they will say that the Word is not God; or
   saying that He is God [2903] , because it is so written, but not proper
   to the Father's Essence, they will introduce many because of their
   difference of kind (unless forsooth they shall dare to say that by
   participation only, He, as all things else, is called God; though, if
   this be their sentiment, their irreligion is the same, since they
   consider the Word as one among all things). But let this never even
   come into our mind. For there is but one form [2904] of Godhead, which
   is also in the Word; and one God, the Father, existing by Himself
   according as He is above all, and appearing in the Son according as He
   pervades all things, and in the Spirit according as in Him He acts in
   all things through the Word [2905] . For thus we confess God to be one
   through the Triad, and we say that it is much more religious than the
   godhead of the heretics with its many kinds [2906] , and many parts, to
   entertain a belief of the One Godhead in a Triad.

   16. For if it be not so, but the Word is a creature and a work out of
   nothing, either He is not True God because He is Himself one of the
   creatures, or if they name Him God from regard for the Scriptures, they
   must of necessity say that there are two Gods [2907] , one Creator, the
   other creature, and must serve two Lords, one Unoriginate, and the
   other originate and a creature; and must have two faiths, one in the
   True God, and the other in one who is made and fashioned by themselves
   and called God. And it follows of necessity in so great blindness,
   that, when they worship the Unoriginate, they renounce the originate,
   and when they come to the creature, they turn from the Creator. For
   they cannot see the One in the Other, because their natures and
   operations are foreign and distinct [2908] . And with such sentiments,
   they will certainly be going on to more gods, for this will be the
   essay [2909] of those who revolt from the One God. Wherefore then, when
   the Arians have these speculations and views, do they not rank
   themselves with the Gentiles? for they too, as these, worship the
   creature rather than God the Creator of all [2910] , and though they
   shrink from the Gentile name, in order to deceive the unskilful, yet
   they secretly hold a like sentiment with them. For their subtle saying
   which they are accustomed to urge, We say not two Unoriginates [2911]
   ,' they plainly say to deceive the simple; for in their very professing
   We say not two Unoriginates,' they imply two Gods, and these with
   different natures, one originate and one Unoriginate. And though the
   Greeks worship one Unoriginate and many originate, but these one
   Unoriginate and one originate, this is no difference from them; for the
   God whom they call originate is one out of many, and again the many
   gods of the Greeks have the same nature with this one, for both he and
   they are creatures. Unhappy are they, and the more for that their hurt
   is from thinking against Christ; for they have fallen from the truth,
   and are greater traitors than the Jews in denying the Christ, and they
   wallow [2912] with the Gentiles, hateful [2913] as they are to God,
   worshipping the creature and many deities. For there is One God, and
   not many, and One is His Word, and not many; for the Word is God, and
   He alone has the Form [2914] of the Father. Being then such, the
   Saviour Himself troubled the Jews with these words, The Father Himself
   which hath sent Me, hath borne witness of Me; ye have neither heard His
   voice at any time nor seen His Form; and ye have not His Word abiding
   in you; for whom He hath sent, Him ye believe not [2915] .' Suitably
   has He joined the Word' to the Form,' to shew that the Word of God is
   Himself Image and Expression and Form of His Father; and that the Jews
   who did not receive Him who spoke to them, thereby did not receive the
   Word, which is the Form of God. This too it was that the Patriarch
   Jacob having seen, received a blessing from Him and the name of Israel
   instead of Jacob, as divine Scripture witnesses, saying, And as he
   passed by the Form of God, the Sun rose upon him [2916] .' And This it
   was who said, He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father,' and, I in the
   Father and the Father in Me,' and, I and the Father are one [2917] ;'
   for thus God is One, and one the faith in the Father and Son; for,
   though the Word be God, the Lord our God is one Lord; for the Son is
   proper to that One, and inseparable according to the propriety and
   peculiarity of His Essence.

   17. The Arians, however, not even thus abashed, reply, Not as you say,
   but as we will [2918] ;' for, whereas you have overthrown our former
   expedients, we have invented a new one, and it is this:--So are the Son
   and the Father One, and so is the Father in the Son and the Son in the
   Father, as we too may become one in Him. For this is written in the
   Gospel according to John, and Christ desired it for us in these words,
   Holy Father, keep through Thine own Name, those whom Thou hast given
   Me, that they may be one, as We are [2919] .' And shortly after;
   Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe
   on Me through their Word; that they all may be one, as Thou, Father,
   art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be one in Us, that the
   world may believe that Thou hast sent Me. And the glory which Thou
   gavest Me I have given them, that they may be one, even as We are one;
   I in them, and Thou in Me, that they may be made perfect in one, and
   that the world may know that Thou didst send Me [2920] .' Then, as
   having found an evasion, these men of craft [2921] add, If, as we
   become one in the Father, so also He and the Father are one, and thus
   He too is in the Father, how pretend you from His saying, "I and the
   Father are One," and "I in the Father and the Father in Me," that He is
   proper and like [2922] the Father's Essence? for it follows either that
   we too are proper to the Father's Essence, or He foreign to it, as we
   are foreign.' Thus they idly babble; but in this their perverseness I
   see nothing but unreasoning audacity and recklessness from the devil
   [2923] , since it is saying after his pattern, We will ascend to
   heaven, we will be like the Most High.' For what is given to man by
   grace, this they would make equal to the Godhead of the Giver. Thus
   hearing that men are called sons, they thought themselves equal to the
   True Son by nature such [2924] . And now again hearing from the
   Saviour, that they may be one as We are [2925] ,' they deceive
   themselves, and are arrogant enough to think that they may be such as
   the Son is in the Father and the Father in the Son; not considering the
   fall of their father the devil [2926] ,' which happened upon such an
   imagination.

   18. If then, as we have many times said, the Word of God is the same
   with us, and nothing differs from us except in time, let Him be like
   us, and have the same place with the Father as we have; nor let Him be
   called Only-begotten, nor Only Word or Wisdom of the Father; but let
   the same name be of common application to all us who are like Him. For
   it is right, that they who have one nature, should have their name in
   common, though they differ from each other in point of time. For Adam
   was a man, and Paul a man, and he who is now born is a man, and time is
   not that which alters the nature of the race [2927] . If then the Word
   also differs from us only in time, then we must be as He. But in truth
   neither we are Word or Wisdom, nor is He creature or work; else why are
   we all sprung from one, and He the Only Word? but though it be suitable
   in them thus to speak, in us at least it is unsuitable to entertain
   their blasphemies. And yet, needless [2928] though it be to refine upon
   [2929] these passages, considering their so clear and religious sense,
   and our own orthodox belief, yet that their irreligion may be shewn
   here also, come let us shortly, as we have received from the fathers,
   expose their heterodoxy from the passage. It is a custom [2930] with
   divine Scripture to take the things of nature as images and
   illustrations for mankind; and this it does, that from these physical
   objects the moral impulses of man may be explained; and thus their
   conduct shewn to be either bad or righteous. For instance, in the case
   of the bad, as when it charges, Be ye not like to horse and mule which
   have no understanding [2931] .' Or as when it says, complaining of
   those who have become such, Man, being in honour, hath no
   understanding, but is compared unto the beasts that perish.' And again,
   They were as wanton horses [2932] .' And the Saviour to expose Herod
   said, Tell that fox [2933] ;' but, on the other hand, charged His
   disciples, Behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves; be
   ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves [2934] .' And He
   said this, not that we may become in nature beasts of burden, or become
   serpents and doves; for He hath not so made us Himself, and therefore
   nature does not allow of it; but that we might eschew the irrational
   motions of the one, and being aware of the wisdom of that other animal,
   might not be deceived by it, and might take on us the meekness of the
   dove.

   19. Again, taking patterns for man from divine subjects, the Saviour
   says; Be ye merciful, as your Father which is in heaven is merciful
   [2935] ;' and, Be ye perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect [2936]
   .' And He said this too, not that we might become such as the Father;
   for to become as the Father, is impossible for us creatures, who have
   been brought to be out of nothing; but as He charged us, Be ye not like
   to horse,' not lest we should become as draught animals, but that we
   should not imitate their want of reason, so, not that we might become
   as God, did He say, Be ye merciful as your Father,' but that looking at
   His beneficent acts, what we do well, we might do, not for men's sake,
   but for His sake, so that from Him and not from men we may have the
   reward. For as, although there be one Son by nature, True and
   Only-begotten, we too become sons, not as He in nature and truth, but
   according to the grace of Him that calleth, and though we are men from
   the earth, are yet called gods [2937] , not as the True God or His
   Word, but as has pleased God who has given us that grace; so also, as
   God do we become merciful, not by being made equal to God, nor becoming
   in nature and truth benefactors (for it is not our gift to benefit but
   belongs to God), but in order that what has accrued to us from God
   Himself by grace, these things we may impart to others, without making
   distinctions, but largely towards all extending our kind service. For
   only in this way can we anyhow become imitators, and in no other, when
   we minister to others what comes from Him. And as we put a fair and
   right [2938] sense upon these texts, such again is the sense of the
   lection in John. For he does not say, that, as the Son is in the
   Father, such we must become:--whence could it be? when He is God's Word
   and Wisdom, and we were fashioned out of the earth, and He is by nature
   and essence Word and true God (for thus speaks John, We know that the
   Son of God is come, and He hath given us an understanding to know Him
   that is true, and we are in Him that is true, even in His Son Jesus
   Christ; this is the true God and eternal life [2939] ') and we are made
   sons through Him by adoption and grace, as partaking of His Spirit (for
   as many as received Him,' he says, to them gave He power to become
   children of God, even to them that believe on His Name [2940] '), and
   therefore also He is the Truth (saying, I am the Truth,' and in His
   address to His Father, He said, Sanctify them through Thy Truth, Thy
   Word is Truth [2941] '); but we by imitation [2942] become virtuous
   [2943] and sons:--therefore not that we might become such as He, did He
   say that they may be one as We are;' but that as He, being the Word, is
   in His own Father, so that we too, taking an examplar and looking at
   Him, might become one towards each other in concord and oneness of
   spirit, nor be at variance as the Corinthians, but mind the same thing,
   as those five thousand in the Acts [2944] , who were as one.

   20. For it is as sons,' not as the Son; as gods,' not as He Himself;
   and not as the Father, but merciful as the Father.' And, as has been
   said, by so becoming one, as the Father and the Son, we shall be such,
   not as the Father is by nature in the Son and the Son in the Father,
   but according to our own nature, and as it is possible for us thence to
   be moulded and to learn how we ought to be one, just as we learned also
   to be merciful. For like things are naturally one with like; thus all
   flesh is ranked together in kind [2945] ; but the Word is unlike us and
   like the Father. And therefore, while He is in nature and truth one
   with His own Father, we, as being of one kind with each other (for from
   one were all made, and one is the nature of all men), become one with
   each other in good disposition [2946] , having as our copy the Son's
   natural unity with the Father. For as He taught us meekness from
   Himself, saying, Learn of Me for I am meek and lowly in heart [2947] ,'
   not that we may become equal to Him, which is impossible, but that
   looking towards Him, we may remain meek continually, so also here
   wishing that our good disposition towards each other should be true and
   firm and indissoluble, from Himself taking the pattern, He says, that
   they may be one as We are,' whose oneness is indivisible; that is, that
   they learning from us of that indivisible Nature, may preserve in like
   manner agreement one with another. And this imitation of natural
   conditions is especially safe for man, as has been said; for, since
   they remain and never change, whereas the conduct of men is very
   changeable, one may look to what is unchangeable by nature, and avoid
   what is bad and remodel himself on what is best.

   21. And for this reason also the words, that they may be one in Us,'
   have a right sense. If, for instance, it were possible for us to become
   as the Son in the Father, the words ought to run, that they may be one
   in Thee,' as the Son is in the Father; but, as it is, He has not said
   this; but by saying in Us' He has pointed out the distance and
   difference; that He indeed is alone in the Father alone, as Only Word
   and Wisdom; but we in the Son, and through Him in the Father. And thus
   speaking, He meant this only, By Our unity may they also be so one with
   each other, as We are one in nature and truth; for otherwise they could
   not be one, except by learning unity in Us.' And that in Us' has this
   signification, we may learn from Paul, who says, These things I have in
   a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos, that ye may learn in us
   not to be puffed up above that is written [2948] .' The words in Us'
   then, are not in the Father,' as the Son is in Him; but imply an
   example and image, instead of saying, Let them learn of Us.' For as
   Paul to the Corinthians, so is the oneness of the Son and the Father a
   pattern and lesson to all, by which they may learn, looking to that
   natural unity of the Father and the Son, how they themselves ought to
   be one in spirit towards each other. Or if it needs to account for the
   phrase otherwise, the words in Us' may mean the same as saying, that in
   the power of the Father and the Son they may be one, speaking the same
   things [2949] ; for without God this is impossible. And this mode of
   speech also we may find in the divine writings, as In God will we do
   great acts;' and In God I shall leap over the wall [2950] ;' and In
   Thee will we tread down our enemies [2951] .' Therefore it is plain,
   that in the Name of Father and Son we shall be able, becoming one, to
   hold firm the bond of charity. For, dwelling still on the same thought,
   the Lord says, And the glory which Thou gavest Me, I have given to
   them, that they may be one as We are one.' Suitably has He here too
   said, not, that they may be in Thee as I am,' but as We are;' now he
   who says as' [2952] , signifies not identity, but an image and example
   of the matter in hand.

   22. The Word then has the real and true identity of nature with the
   Father; but to us it is given to imitate it, as has been said; for He
   immediately adds, I in them and Thou in Me; that they may be made
   perfect in one.' Here at length the Lord asks something greater and
   more perfect for us; for it is plain that the Word has come to be in us
   [2953] , for He has put on our body. And Thou Father in Me;' for I am
   Thy Word, and since Thou art in Me, because I am Thy Word, and I in
   them because of the body, and because of Thee the salvation of men is
   perfected in Me, therefore I ask that they also may become one,
   according to the body that is in Me and according to its perfection;
   that they too may become perfect, having oneness with It, and having
   become one in It; that, as if all were carried by Me, all may be one
   body and one spirit, and may grow up unto a perfect man [2954] .' For
   we all, partaking of the Same, become one body, having the one Lord in
   ourselves. The passage then having this meaning, still more plainly is
   refuted the heterodoxy of Christ's enemies. I repeat it; if He had said
   simply and absolutely [2955] that they may be one in Thee,' or that
   they and I may be one in Thee,' God's enemies had had some plea, though
   a shameless one; but in fact He has not spoken simply, but, As Thou,
   Father, in Me, and I in Thee, that they may be all one.' Moreover,
   using the word as,' He signifies those who become distantly as He is in
   the Father; distantly not in place but in nature; for in place nothing
   is far from God [2956] , but in nature only all things are far from
   Him. And, as I said before, whoso uses the particle as' implies, not
   identity, nor equality, but a pattern of the matter in question, viewed
   in a certain respect [2957] .

   23. Indeed we may learn also from the Saviour Himself, when He says,
   For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale's belly, so
   shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the
   earth [2958] .' For Jonah was not as the Saviour, nor did Jonah go down
   to hades; nor was the whale hades; nor did Jonah, when swallowed up,
   bring up those who had before been swallowed by the whale, but he alone
   came forth, when the whale was bidden. Therefore there is no identity
   nor equality signified in the term as,' but one thing and another; and
   it shews a certain kind [2959] of parallel in the case of Jonah, on
   account of the three days. In like manner then we too, when the Lord
   says as,' neither become as the Son in the Father, nor as the Father is
   in the Son. For we become one as the Father and the Son in mind and
   agreement [2960] of spirit, and the Saviour will be as Jonah in the
   earth; but as the Saviour is not Jonah, nor, as he was swallowed up, so
   did the Saviour descend into hades, but it is but a parallel, in like
   manner, if we too become one, as the Son in the Father, we shall not be
   as the Son, nor equal to Him; for He and we are but parallel. For on
   this account is the word as' applied to us; since things differing from
   others in nature, become as they, when viewed in a certain relation
   [2961] . Wherefore the Son Himself, simply and without any condition is
   in the Father; for this attribute He has by nature; but for us, to whom
   it is not natural, there is needed an image and example, that He may
   say of us, As Thou in Me, and I in Thee.' And when they shall be so
   perfected,' He says, then the world knows that Thou hast sent Me, for
   unless I had come and borne this their body, no one of them had been
   perfected, but one and all had remained corruptible. [2962] Work Thou
   then in them, O Father, and as Thou hast given to Me to bear this,
   grant to them Thy Spirit, that they too in It may become one, and may
   be perfected in Me. For their perfecting shews that Thy Word has
   sojourned among them; and the world seeing them perfect and full of God
   [2963] , will believe altogether that Thou hast sent Me, and I have
   sojourned here. For whence is this their perfecting, but that I, Thy
   Word, having borne their body, and become man, have perfected the work,
   which Thou gavest Me, O Father? And the work is perfected, because men,
   redeemed from sin, no longer remain dead; but being deified [2964] ,
   have in each other, by looking at Me, the bond of charity [2965] .'

   24. We then, by way of giving a rude view of the expressions in this
   passage, have been led into many words, but blessed John will shew from
   his Epistle the sense of the words, concisely and much more perfectly
   than we can. And he will both disprove the interpretation of these
   irreligious men, and will teach how we become in God and God in us; and
   how again we become One in Him, and how far the Son differs in nature
   from us, and will stop the Arians from any longer thinking that they
   shall be as the Son, lest they hear it said to them, Thou art a man and
   not God,' and Stretch not thyself, being poor, beside a rich man [2966]
   .' John then thus writes; Hereby know we that we dwell in Him and He in
   us, because He hath given us of His Spirit [2967] .' Therefore because
   of the grace of the Spirit which has been given to us, in Him we come
   to be, and He in us [2968] ; and since it is the Spirit of God,
   therefore through His becoming in us, reasonably are we, as having the
   Spirit, considered to be in God, and thus is God in us. Not then as the
   Son in the Father, so also we become in the Father; for the Son does
   not merely partake the Spirit, that therefore He too may be in the
   Father; nor does He receive the Spirit, but rather He supplies It
   Himself to all; and the Spirit does not unite the Word to the Father
   [2969] , but rather the Spirit receives from the Word. And the Son is
   in the Father, as His own Word and Radiance; but we, apart from the
   Spirit, are strange and distant from God, and by the participation of
   the Spirit we are knit into the Godhead; so that our being in the
   Father is not ours, but is the Spirit's which is in us and abides in
   us, while by the true confession we preserve it in us, John again
   saying, Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God
   dwelleth in him and he in God [2970] .' What then is our likeness and
   equality to the Son? rather, are not the Arians confuted on every side?
   and especially by John, that the Son is in the Father in one way, and
   we become in Him in another, and that neither we shall ever be as He,
   nor is the Word as we; except they shall dare, as commonly, so now to
   say, that the Son also by participation of the Spirit and by
   improvement of conduct [2971] came to be Himself also in the Father.
   But here again is an excess of irreligion, even in admitting the
   thought. For He, as has been said, gives to the Spirit, and whatever
   the Spirit hath, He hath from [2972] the Word.

   25. The Saviour, then, saying of us, As Thou, Father, art in Me, and I
   in Thee, that they too may be one in Us,' does not signify that we were
   to have identity with Him; for this was shewn from the instance of
   Jonah; but it is a request to the Father, as John has written, that the
   Spirit should be vouchsafed through Him to those who believe, through
   whom we are found to be in God, and in this respect to be conjoined in
   Him. For since the Word is in the Father, and the Spirit is given from
   [2973] the Word, He wills that we should receive the Spirit, that, when
   we receive It, thus having the Spirit of the Word which is in the
   Father, we too may be found on account of the Spirit to become One in
   the Word, and through Him in the Father. And if He say, as we,' this
   again is only a request that such grace of the Spirit as is given to
   the disciples may be without failure or revocation [2974] . For what
   the Word has by nature [2975] , as I said, in the Father, that He
   wishes to be given to us through the Spirit irrevocably; which the
   Apostle knowing, said, Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?'
   for the gifts of God' and grace of His calling are without repentance
   [2976] .' It is the Spirit then which is in God, and not we viewed in
   our own selves; and as we are sons and gods [2977] because of the Word
   in us [2978] , so we shall be in the Son and in the Father, and we
   shall be accounted to have become one in Son and in Father, because
   that that Spirit is in us, which is in the Word which is in the Father.
   When then a man falls from the Spirit for any wickedness, if he repent
   upon his fall, the grace remains irrevocably to such as are willing
   [2979] ; otherwise he who has fallen is no longer in God (because that
   Holy Spirit and Paraclete which is in God has deserted him), but the
   sinner shall be in him to whom he has subjected himself, as took place
   in Saul's instance; for the Spirit of God departed from him and an evil
   spirit was afflicting him [2980] . God's enemies hearing this ought to
   be henceforth abashed, and no longer to feign themselves equal to God.
   But they neither understand (for the irreligious,' he saith, does not
   understand knowledge' [2981] ) nor endure religious words, but find
   them heavy even to hear.

   of the Son as synonymous with image.' It would seem as if there are a
   certain class of words, all expressive of the One Divine Substance,
   which admit of more appropriate application either ordinarily or under
   circumstances, to This or That Divine Person who is also that One
   Substance. Thus Being' is more descriptive of the Father as the pege
   theotetos, and He is said to be the Being of the Son;' yet the Son is
   really the One Supreme Being also. On the other hand the words morphe
   and eidos [on them see Lightfoot, Philipp. p. 128] are rather
   descriptive of the Divine Substance in the Person of the Son, and He is
   called the form of the Father,' yet there is but one Form and Face of
   Divinity, who is at once Each of Three Persons; while Spirit' is
   appropriated to the Third Person, though God is a Spirit. Thus again S.
   Hippolytus says ek [tou patros] dunamis logos, yet shortly before,
   after mentioning the Two Persons, he adds, dunamin de mian, contr.
   Noet. 7 and 11. And thus the word Subsistence,' hupostasis, which
   expresses the One Divine Substance, has been found more appropriate to
   express that Substance viewed personally. Other words may be used
   correlatively of either Father or Son; thus the Father is the Life of
   the Son, the Son the Life of the Father; or, again, the Father is in
   the Son and the Son in the Father. Others in common, as the Father's
   Godhead is the Son's,' he patrike huiou theotes, as indeed the word
   ousia itself. Other words on the contrary express the Substance in This
   or That Person only, as Word,' Image,' &c.

   Chapter XXVI.--Introductory to Texts from the Gospels on the
   Incarnation. Enumeration of texts still to be explained. Arians
   compared to the Jews. We must recur to the Regula Fidei. Our Lord did
   not come into, but became, man, and therefore had the acts and
   affections of the flesh. The same works divine and human. Thus the
   flesh was purified, and men were made immortal. Reference to I Pet. iv.
   1.

   26. For behold, as if not wearied in their words of irreligion, but
   hardened with Pharaoh, while they hear and see the Saviour's human
   attributes in the Gospels [2982] , they have utterly forgotten, like
   the Samosatene, the Son's paternal Godhead [2983] , and with arrogant
   and audacious tongue they say, How can the Son be from the Father by
   nature, and be like Him in essence,' who says, All power is given unto
   Me;' and The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment
   unto the Son;' and The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things
   into His hand; he that believeth in the Son hath everlasting life;' and
   again, All things were delivered unto Me of My Father, and no one
   knoweth the Father save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will
   reveal Him;' and again, All that the Father hath given unto Me, shall
   come to Me [2984] .' On this they observe, If He was, as ye say, Son by
   nature, He had no need to receive, but He had by nature as a Son.' "Or
   how can He be the natural and true Power of the Father, who near upon
   the season of the passion says, Now is My soul troubled, and what shall
   I say? Father, save Me from this hour; but for this came I unto this
   hour. Father, glorify Thy Name. Then came there a voice from heaven,
   saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again [2985] .'
   And He said the same another time; Father, if it be possible, let this
   cup pass from Me;' and When Jesus had thus said, He was troubled in
   spirit and testified and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one
   of you shall betray Me [2986] .'" Then these perverse men argue; If He
   were Power, He had not feared, but rather He had supplied power to
   others.' Further they say; If He were by nature the true and own Wisdom
   of the Father,' how is it written, And Jesus increased in wisdom and
   stature, and in favour with God and man [2987] ?' In like manner, when
   He had come into the parts of CÃ¦sarea Philippi, He asked the disciples
   whom men said that He was; and when He was at Bethany He asked where
   Lazarus lay; and He said besides to His disciples, How many loaves have
   ye [2988] ? How then,' say they, is He Wisdom, who increased in wisdom
   and was ignorant of what He asked of others?' This too they urge; "How
   can He be the own Word of the Father, without whom the Father never
   was, through whom He makes all things, as ye think, who said upon the
   Cross My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?' and before that had
   prayed, Glorify Thy Name,' and, O Father, glorify Thou Me with the
   glory which I had with Thee before the world was.' And He used to pray
   in the deserts and charge His disciples to pray lest they should enter
   into temptation; and, The spirit indeed is willing,' He said, but the
   flesh is weak.' And, Of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, nor
   the Angels, neither the Son [2989] .'" Upon this again say the
   miserable men, "If the Son were, according to your interpretation
   [2990] , eternally existent with God, He had not been ignorant of the
   Day, but had known as Word; nor had been forsaken as being coexistent;
   nor had asked to receive glory, as having it in the Father; nor would
   have prayed at all; for, being the Word, He had needed nothing; but
   since He is a creature and one of things originate, therefore He thus
   spoke, and needed what He had not; for it is proper to creatures to
   require and to need what they have not."

   27. This then is what the irreligious men allege in their discourses;
   and if they thus argue, they might consistently speak yet more
   daringly; Why did the Word become flesh at all?' and they might add;
   For how could He, being God, become man?' or, How could the Immaterial
   bear a body?' or they might speak with Caiaphas still more Judaically,
   Wherefore at all did Christ, being a man, make Himself God [2991] ?'
   for this and the like the Jews then muttered when they saw, and now the
   Ario-maniacs disbelieve when they read, and have fallen away into
   blasphemies. If then a man should carefully parallel the words of these
   and those, he will of a certainty find them both arriving at the same
   unbelief, and the daring of their irreligion equal, and their dispute
   with us a common one. For the Jews said; How, being a man, can He be
   God?' And the Arians, If He were very God from God, how could He become
   man?' And the Jews were offended then and mocked, saying, Had He been
   Son of God, He had not endured the Cross;' and the Arians standing over
   against them, urge upon us, How dare ye say that He is the Word proper
   to the Father's Essence, who had a body, so as to endure all this?'
   Next, while the Jews sought to kill the Lord, because He said that God
   was His own Father and made Himself equal to Him, as working what the
   Father works, the Arians also, not only have learned to deny, both that
   He is equal to God and that God is the own and natural Father of the
   Word, but those who hold this they seek to kill. Again, whereas the
   Jews said, Is not this the Son of Joseph, whose father and mother we
   know? how then is it that He saith, Before Abraham was, I am, and I
   came down from heaven [2992] ?' the Arians on the other hand make
   response [2993] and say conformably, How can He be Word or God who
   slept as man, and wept, and inquired?' Thus both parties deny the
   Eternity and Godhead of the Word in consequence of those human
   attributes which the Saviour took on Him by reason of that flesh which
   He bore.

   28. Such error then being Judaic, and Judaic after the mind of Judas
   the traitor, let them openly confess themselves scholars of Caiaphas
   and Herod, instead of cloking Judaism with the name of Christianity,
   and let them deny outright, as we have said before, the Saviour's
   appearance in the flesh, for this doctrine is akin to their heresy; or
   if they fear openly to Judaize and be circumcised [2994] , from
   servility towards Constantius and for their sake whom they have
   beguiled, then let them not say what the Jews say; for if they disown
   the name, let them in fairness renounce the doctrine. For we are
   Christians, O Arians, Christians we; our privilege is it well to know
   the Gospels concerning the Saviour, and neither, with Jews to stone
   Him, if we hear of His Godhead and Eternity, nor with you to stumble at
   such lowly sayings as He may speak for our sakes as man. If then you
   would become Christians [2995] , put off Arius's madness, and cleanse
   [2996] with the words of religion those ears of yours which blaspheming
   has defiled; knowing that, by ceasing to be Arians, you will cease also
   from the malevolence of the present Jews. Then at once will truth shine
   on you out of darkness, and ye will no longer reproach us with holding
   two Eternals [2997] , but ye will yourselves acknowledge that the Lord
   is God's true Son by nature, and not as merely eternal [2998] , but
   revealed as co-existing in the Father's eternity. For there are things
   called eternal of which He is Framer; for in the twenty-third Psalm it
   is written, Lift up your gates, O ye rulers, and be ye lift up, ye
   everlasting gates [2999] ;' and it is plain that through Him these
   things were made; but if even of things everlasting He is the Framer,
   who of us shall be able henceforth to dispute that He is anterior to
   those things eternal, and in consequence is proved to be Lord not so
   much from His eternity, as in that He is God's Son; for being the Son,
   He is inseparable from the Father, and never was there when He was not,
   but He was always; and being the Father's Image and Radiance, He has
   the Father's eternity. Now what has been briefly said above may suffice
   to shew their misunderstanding of the passages they then alleged; and
   that of what they now allege from the Gospels they certainly give an
   unsound interpretation [3000] , we may easily see, if we now consider
   the scope [3001] of that faith which we Christians hold, and using it
   as a rule, apply ourselves, as the Apostle teaches, to the reading of
   inspired Scripture. For Christ's enemies, being ignorant of this scope,
   have wandered from the way of truth, and have stumbled [3002] on a
   stone of stumbling, thinking otherwise than they should think.

   29. Now the scope and character of Holy Scripture, as we have often
   said, is this,--it contains a double account of the Saviour; that He
   was ever God, and is the Son, being the Father's Word and Radiance and
   Wisdom [3003] ; and that afterwards for us He took flesh of a Virgin,
   Mary Bearer of God [3004] , and was made man. And this scope is to be
   found throughout inspired Scripture, as the Lord Himself has said,
   Search the Scriptures, for they are they which testify of Me [3005] .'
   But lest I should exceed in writing, by bringing together all the
   passages on the subject, let it suffice to mention as a specimen, first
   John saying, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
   and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All
   things were made by Him, and without Him was made not one thing [3006]
   ;' next, And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld
   His glory, the glory as of one Only-begotten from the Father [3007] ;'
   and next Paul writing, Who being in the form of God, thought it not a
   prize to be equal with God, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a
   servant, being made in the likeness of men, and being found in fashion
   like a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient unto death, even the
   death of the Cross [3008] .' Any one, beginning with these passages and
   going through the whole of the Scripture upon the interpretation [3009]
   which they suggest, will perceive how in the beginning the Father said
   to Him, Let there be light,' and Let there be a firmament,' and Let us
   make man [3010] ;' but in fulness of the ages, He sent Him into the
   world, not that He might judge the world, but that the world by Him
   might be saved, and how it is written Behold, the Virgin shall be with
   child, and shall bring forth a Son, and they shall call his Name
   Emmanuel, which, being interpreted, is God with us [3011] .'

   30. The reader then of divine Scripture may acquaint himself with these
   passages from the ancient books; and from the Gospels on the other hand
   he will perceive that the Lord became man; for the Word,' he says,
   became flesh, and dwelt among us [3012] .' And He became man, and did
   not come into man; for this it is necessary to know, lest perchance
   these irreligious men fall into this notion also, and beguile any into
   thinking, that, as in former times the Word was used to come into each
   of the Saints, so now He sojourned in a man, hallowing him also, and
   manifesting [3013] Himself as in the others. For if it were so, and He
   only appeared in a man, it were nothing strange, nor had those who saw
   Him been startled, saying, Whence is He? and wherefore dost Thou, being
   a man, make Thyself God? for they were familiar with the idea, from the
   words, And the Word of the Lord came' to this or that of the Prophets
   [3014] . But now, since the Word of God, by whom all things came to be,
   endured to become also Son of man, and humbled Himself, taking a
   servant's form, therefore to the Jews the Cross of Christ is a scandal,
   but to us Christ is God's power' and God's wisdom [3015] ;' for the
   Word,' as John says, became flesh' (it being the custom [3016] of
   Scripture to call man by the name of flesh,' as it says by Joel the
   Prophet, I will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh;' and as Daniel said
   to Astyages, I do not worship idols made with hands, but the Living
   God, who hath created the heaven and the earth, and hath sovereignty
   over all flesh [3017] ;' for both he and Joel call mankind flesh).

   31. Of old time He was wont to come to the Saints individually, and to
   hallow those who rightly [3018] received Him; but neither, when they
   were begotten was it said that He had become man, nor, when they
   suffered, was it said that He Himself suffered. But when He came among
   us from Mary once at the end of the ages for the abolition of sin (for
   so it was pleasing to the Father, to send His own Son made of a woman,
   made under the Law'), then it is said, that He took flesh and became
   man, and in that flesh He suffered for us (as Peter says, Christ
   therefore having suffered for us in the flesh [3019] ,' that it might
   be shewn, and that all might believe, that whereas He was ever God, and
   hallowed those to whom He came, and ordered all things according to the
   Father's will [3020] , afterwards for our sakes He became man, and
   bodily [3021] ,' as the Apostle says, the Godhead dwelt in the flesh;
   as much as to say, Being God, He had His own body, and using this as an
   instrument [3022] , He became man for our sakes.' And on account of
   this, the properties of the flesh are said to be His, since He was in
   it, such as to hunger, to thirst, to suffer, to weary, and the like, of
   which the flesh is capable; while on the other hand the works proper to
   the Word Himself, such as to raise the dead, to restore sight to the
   blind, and to cure the woman with an issue of blood, He did through His
   own body [3023] . And the Word bore the infirmities of the flesh, as
   His own, for His was the flesh; and the flesh ministered to the works
   of the Godhead, because the Godhead was in it, for the body was God's
   [3024] . And well has the Prophet said carried [3025] ;' and has not
   said, He remedied our infirmities,' lest, as being external to the
   body, and only healing it, as He has always done, He should leave men
   subject still to death; but He carries our infirmities, and He Himself
   bears our sins, that it might be shewn that He has become man for us,
   and that the body which in Him bore them, was His own body; and, while
   He received no hurt [3026] Himself by bearing our sins in His body on
   the tree,' as Peter speaks, we men were redeemed from our own
   affections [3027] , and were filled with the righteousness [3028] of
   the Word.

   32. Whence it was that, when the flesh suffered, the Word was not
   external to it; and therefore is the passion said to be His: and when
   He did divinely His Father's works, the flesh was not external to Him,
   but in the body itself did the Lord do them. Hence, when made man, He
   said [3029] , If I do not the works of the Father, believe Me not; but
   if I do, though ye believe not Me, believe the works, that ye may know
   that the Father is in Me and I in Him.' And thus when there was need to
   raise Peter's wife's mother, who was sick of a fever, He stretched
   forth His hand humanly, but He stopped the illness divinely. And in the
   case of the man blind from the birth, human was the spittle which He
   gave forth from the flesh, but divinely did He open the eyes through
   the clay. And in the case of Lazarus, He gave forth a human voice as
   man; but divinely, as God, did He raise Lazarus from the dead [3030] .
   These things were so done, were so manifested, because He had a body,
   not in appearance, but in truth [3031] ; and it became the Lord, in
   putting on human flesh, to put it on whole with the affections proper
   to it; that, as we say that the body was His own, so also we may say
   that the affections of the body were proper to Him alone, though they
   did not touch Him according to His Godhead. If then the body had been
   another's, to him too had been the affections attributed; but if the
   flesh is the Word's (for the Word became flesh'), of necessity then the
   affections also of the flesh are ascribed to Him, whose the flesh is.
   And to whom the affections are ascribed, such namely as to be
   condemned, to be scourged, to thirst, and the cross, and death, and the
   other infirmities of the body, of Him too is the triumph and the grace.
   For this cause then, consistently and fittingly such affections are
   ascribed not to another [3032] , but to the Lord; that the grace also
   may be from Him [3033] , and that we may become, not worshippers of any
   other, but truly devout towards God, because we invoke no originate
   thing, no ordinary [3034] man, but the natural and true Son from God,
   who has become man, yet is not the less Lord and God and Saviour.

   33. Who will not admire this? or who will not agree that such a thing
   is truly divine? for if the works of the Word's Godhead had not taken
   place through the body, man had not been deified; and again, had not
   the properties of the flesh been ascribed to the Word, man had not been
   thoroughly delivered from them [3035] ; but though they had ceased for
   a little while, as I said before, still sin had remained in him and
   corruption, as was the case with mankind before Him; and for this
   reason:--Many for instance have been made holy and clean from all sin;
   nay, Jeremiah was hallowed [3036] even from the womb, and John, while
   yet in the womb, leapt for joy at the voice of Mary Bearer of God
   [3037] ; nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those
   that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression [3038]
   ;' and thus man remained mortal and corruptible as before, liable to
   the affections proper to their nature. But now the Word having become
   man and having appropriated [3039] what pertains to the flesh, no
   longer do these things touch the body, because of the Word who has come
   in it, but they are destroyed [3040] by Him, and henceforth men no
   longer remain sinners and dead according to their proper affections,
   but having risen according to the Word's power, they abide [3041] ever
   immortal and incorruptible. Whence also, whereas the flesh is born of
   Mary Bearer of God [3042] , He Himself is said to have been born, who
   furnishes to others an origin of being; in order that He may transfer
   our origin into Himself, and we may no longer, as mere earth, return to
   earth, but as being knit into the Word from heaven, may be carried to
   heaven by Him. Therefore in like manner not without reason has He
   transferred to Himself the other affections of the body also; that we,
   no longer as being men, but as proper to the Word, may have share in
   eternal life. For no longer according to our former origin in Adam do
   we die; but henceforward our origin and all infirmity of flesh being
   transferred to the Word, we rise from the earth, the curse from sin
   being removed, because of Him who is in us [3043] , and who has become
   a curse for us. And with reason; for as we are all from earth and die
   in Adam, so being regenerated from above of water and Spirit, in the
   Christ we are all quickened; the flesh being no longer earthly, but
   being henceforth made Word [3044] , by reason of God's Word who for our
   sake became flesh.'

   34. And that one may attain to a more exact knowledge of the
   impassibility of the Word's nature and of the infirmities ascribed to
   Him because of the flesh, it will be well to listen to the blessed
   Peter; for he will be a trustworthy witness concerning the Saviour. He
   writes then in his Epistle thus; Christ then having suffered for us in
   the flesh [3045] .' Therefore also when He is said to hunger and thirst
   and to toil and not to know, and to sleep, and to weep, and to ask, and
   to flee, and to be born, and to deprecate the cup, and in a word to
   undergo all that belongs to the flesh [3046] , let it be said, as is
   congruous, in each case Christ then hungering and thirsting "for us in
   the flesh;"' and saying He did not know, and being buffeted, and
   toiling "for us in the flesh;"' and being exalted too, and born, and
   growing "in the flesh;"' and fearing and hiding "in the flesh;"' and
   saying, "If it be possible let this cup pass from Me [3047] ," and
   being beaten, and receiving, "for us in the flesh;"' and in a word all
   such things for us in the flesh.' For on this account has the Apostle
   himself said, Christ then having suffered,' not in His Godhead, but for
   us in the flesh,' that these affections may be acknowledged as, not
   proper to the very Word by nature, but proper by nature to the very
   flesh.

   Let no one then stumble at what belongs to man, but rather let a man
   know that in nature the Word Himself is impassible, and yet because of
   that flesh which He put on, these things are ascribed to Him, since
   they are proper to the flesh, and the body itself is proper to the
   Saviour. And while He Himself, being impassible in nature, remains as
   He is, not harmed [3048] by these affections, but rather obliterating
   and destroying them, men, their passions as if changed and abolished
   [3049] in the Impassible, henceforth become themselves also impassible
   and free [3050] from them for ever, as John taught, saying, And ye know
   that He was manifested to take away our sins, and in Him is no sin
   [3051] .' And this being so, no heretic shall object, Wherefore rises
   the flesh, being by nature mortal? and if it rises, why not hunger too
   and thirst, and suffer, and remain mortal? for it came from the earth,
   and how can its natural condition pass from it?' since the flesh is
   able now to make answer to this so contentious heretic, I am from
   earth, being by nature mortal, but afterwards I have become the Word's
   flesh,' and He carried' my affections, though He is without them; and
   so I became free from them, being no more abandoned to their service
   because of the Lord who has made me free from them. For if you object
   to my being rid of that corruption which is by nature, see that you
   object not to God's Word having taken my form of servitude; for as the
   Lord, putting on the body, became man, so we men are deified by the
   Word as being taken to Him through His flesh, and henceforward inherit
   life everlasting.'

   35. These points we have found it necessary first to examine, that,
   when we see Him doing or saying aught divinely through the instrument
   [3052] of His own body, we may know that He so works, being God, and
   also, if we see Him speaking or suffering humanly, we may not be
   ignorant that He bore flesh and became man, and hence He so acts and so
   speaks. For if we recognise what is proper to each, and see and
   understand that both these things and those are done by One [3053] , we
   are right in our faith, and shall never stray. But if a man looking at
   what is done divinely by the Word, deny the body, or looking at what is
   proper to the body, deny the Word's presence in the flesh, or from what
   is human entertain low thoughts concerning the Word, such a one, as a
   Jewish vintner [3054] , mixing water with the wine, shall account the
   Cross an offence, or as a Gentile, will deem the preaching folly. This
   then is what happens to God's enemies the Arians; for looking at what
   is human in the Saviour, they have judged Him a creature. Therefore
   they ought, looking also at the divine works of the Word, to deny
   [3055] the origination of His body, and henceforth to rank themselves
   with Manichees [3056] . But for them, learn they, however tardily, that
   the Word became flesh;' and let us, retaining the general scope [3057]
   of the faith, acknowledge that what they interpret ill, has a right
   interpretation [3058] .

   [2997] Cf. de Decr. 25, n. 4. The peculiarity of the Catholic doctrine,
   as contrasted with the heresies on the subject of the Trinity, is that
   it professes a mystery. It involves, not merely a contradiction in the
   terms used, which would be little, for we might solve it by assigning
   different senses to the same word, or by adding some limitation (e.g.
   if it were said that Satan was an Angel and not an Angel, or man was
   mortal and immortal), but an incongruity in the ideas which it
   introduces. To say that the Father is wholly and absolutely the one
   infinitely-simple God, and then that the Son is also, and yet that the
   Father is eternally distinct from the Son, is to propose ideas which we
   cannot harmonize together; and our reason is reconciled to this state
   of the case only by the consideration (though fully by means of it)
   that no idea of ours can embrace the simple truth, so that we are
   obliged to separate it into portions, and view it in aspects, and
   adumbrate it under many ideas, if we are to make any approximation
   towards it at all; as in mathematics we approximate to a circle by
   means of a polygon, great as is the dissimilarity between the two
   figures. [Cf. Prolegg. ch. ii. Â§3 (2) b.]

   [2998] ouch haplos a& 188;dios, i.e. aidios is not one of our Lord's
   highest titles, for things have it which the Son Himself has created,
   and whom of course He precedes. Instead of two aidia then, as the
   Arians say, there are many aidia; and our Lord's high title is not
   this, but that He is the Son,' and thereby eternal in the Father's
   eternity,' or there was not ever when He was not, and Image' and
   Radiance.' The same line of thought is implied throughout his proof of
   our Lord's eternity in Orat. i. ch. 4 6. This is worth remarking, as
   constituting a special distinction between ancient and modern Scripture
   proofs of the doctrine, and as coinciding with what was said supr. Or.
   ii. 1, n. 13, 44, n. 1. His mode of proof is still more brought out by
   what he proceeds to say about the skopos, or general bearing or drift
   of the Christian faith, and its availableness as a kanon or rule of
   interpretation.

   sake, that we might receive and not lose, as receiving in Him. And
   consistently with other parts of Scripture, which shew that He had the
   power, &c., before He received it. He was God and man, and His actions
   are often at once divine and human.

   35 (continued). For, The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all
   things into His hand;' and, All things were given unto Me of My
   Father;' and, I can do nothing of Myself, but as I hear, I judge [3059]
   ;' and the like passages do not shew that the Son once had not these
   prerogatives--(for had not He eternally what the Father has, who is the
   Only Word and Wisdom of the Father in essence, who also says, All that
   the Father hath are Mine [3060] ,' and what are Mine, are the Father's?
   for if the things of the Father are the Son's and the Father hath them
   ever, it is plain that what the Son hath, being the Father's, were ever
   in the Son),--not then because once He had them not, did He say this,
   but because, whereas the Son hath eternally what He hath, yet He hath
   them from the Father.

   36. For lest a man, perceiving that the Son has all that the Father
   hath, from the exact likeness and identity of that He hath, should
   wander into the irreligion of Sabellius, considering Him to be the
   Father, therefore He has said Was given unto Me,' and I received,' and
   Were delivered to Me [3061] ,' only to shew that He is not the Father,
   but the Father's Word, and the Eternal Son, who because of His likeness
   to the Father, has eternally what He has from Him, and because He is
   the Son, has from the Father what He has eternally. Moreover that Was
   given' and Were delivered,' and the like, do not impair [3062] the
   Godhead of the Son, but rather shew Him to be truly [3063] Son, we may
   learn from the passages themselves. For if all things are delivered
   unto Him, first, He is other than that all which He has received; next,
   being Heir of all things, He alone is the Son and proper according to
   the Essence of the Father. For if He were one of all, then He were not
   heir of all [3064] ,' but every one had received according as the
   Father willed and gave. But now, as receiving all things, He is other
   than them all, and alone proper to the Father. Moreover that Was given'
   and Were delivered' do not shew that once He had them not, we may
   conclude from a similar passage, and in like manner concerning them
   all; for the Saviour Himself says, As the Father hath life in Himself,
   so hath He given also to the Son to have life in Himself [3065] .' Now
   from the words Hath given,' He signifies that He is not the Father; but
   in saying so,' He shews the Son's natural likeness and propriety
   towards the Father. If then once the Father had not, plainly the Son
   once had not; for as the Father, so' also the Son has. But if this is
   irreligious to say, and religious on the contrary to say that the
   Father had ever, is it not unseemly in them when the Son says that, as'
   the Father has, so' also the Son has, to say that He has not so [3066]
   ,' but otherwise? Rather then is the Word faithful, and all things
   which He says that He has received, He has always, yet has from the
   Father; and the Father indeed not from any, but the Son from the
   Father. For as in the instance of the radiance, if the radiance itself
   should say, All places the light hath given me to enlighten, and I do
   not enlighten from myself, but as the light wills,' yet, in saying
   this, it does not imply that it once had not, but it means, I am proper
   to the light, and all things of the light are mine;' so, and much more,
   must we understand in the instance of the Son. For the Father, having
   given all things to the Son, in the Son still [3067] hath all things;
   and the Son having, still the Father hath them; for the Son's Godhead
   is the Father's Godhead, and thus the Father in the Son exercises His
   Providence [3068] over all things.

   37. And while such is the sense of expressions like these, those which
   speak humanly concerning the Saviour admit of a religious meaning also.
   For with this end have we examined them beforehand, that, if we should
   hear Him asking where Lazarus is laid [3069] , or when He asks on
   coming into the parts of CÃ¦sarea, Whom do men say that I am?' or, How
   many loaves have ye?' and, What will ye that I shall do unto you [3070]
   ?' we may know, from what has been already said, the right [3071] sense
   of the passages, and may not stumble as Christ's enemies the Arians.
   First then we must put this question to the irreligious, why they
   consider Him ignorant? for one who asks, does not for certain ask from
   ignorance; but it is possible for one who knows, still to ask
   concerning what He knows. Thus John was aware that Christ, when asking,
   How many loaves have ye?' was not ignorant, for he says, And this He
   said to prove him, for He Himself knew what He would do [3072] .' But
   if He knew what He was doing, therefore not in ignorance, but with
   knowledge did He ask. From this instance we may understand similar
   ones; that, when the Lord asks, He does not ask in ignorance, where
   Lazarus lies, nor again, whom men do say that He is; but knowing the
   thing which He was asking, aware what He was about to do. And thus with
   ease is their clever point exploded; but if they still persist [3073]
   on account of His asking, then they must be told that in the Godhead
   indeed ignorance is not, but to the flesh ignorance is proper, as has
   been said. And that this is really so, observe how the Lord who
   inquired where Lazarus lay, Himself said, when He was not on the spot
   but a great way off, Lazarus is dead [3074] ,' and where he was dead;
   and how that He who is considered by them as ignorant, is He Himself
   who foreknew the reasonings of the disciples, and was aware of what was
   in the heart of each, and of what was in man,' and, what is greater,
   alone knows the Father and says, I in the Father and the Father in Me.
   [3075] '

   38. Therefore this is plain to every one, that the flesh indeed is
   ignorant, but the Word Himself, considered as the Word, knows all
   things even before they come to be. For He did not, when He became man,
   cease to be God [3076] ; nor, whereas He is God does He shrink from
   what is man's; perish the thought; but rather, being God, He has taken
   to Him the flesh, and being in the flesh deifies the flesh. For as He
   asked questions in it, so also in it did He raise the dead; and He
   shewed to all that He who quickens the dead and recalls the soul, much
   more discerns the secret of all. And He knew where Lazarus lay, and yet
   He asked; for the All-holy Word of God, who endured all things for our
   sakes, did this, that so carrying our ignorance, He might vouchsafe to
   us the knowledge of His own only and true Father, and of Himself, sent
   because of us for the salvation of all, than which no grace could be
   greater. When then the Saviour uses the words which they allege in
   their defence, Power is given to Me,' and, Glorify Thy Son,' and Peter
   says, Power is given unto Him,' we understand all these passages in the
   same sense, that humanly because of the body He says all this. For
   though He had no need, nevertheless He is said to have received what He
   received humanly, that on the other hand, inasmuch as the Lord has
   received, and the grant is lodged with Him, the grace may remain sure.
   For while mere man receives, he is liable to lose again (as was shewn
   in the case of Adam, for he received and he lost [3077] ), but that the
   grace may be irrevocable, and may be kept sure [3078] by men, therefore
   He Himself appropriates [3079] the gift; and He says that He has
   received power, as man, which He ever had as God, and He says, Glorify
   Me,' who glorifies others, to shew that He hath a flesh which has need
   of these things. Wherefore, when the flesh receives, since that which
   receives is in Him, and by taking it He hath become man, therefore He
   is said Himself to have received.

   39. If then (as has many times been said) the Word has not become man,
   then ascribe to the Word, as you would have it, to receive, and to need
   glory, and to be ignorant; but if He has become man (and He has
   become), and it is man's to receive, and to need, and to be ignorant,
   wherefore do we consider the Giver as receiver, and the Dispenser to
   others do we suspect to be in need, and divide the Word from the Father
   as imperfect and needy, while we strip human nature of grace? For if
   the Word Himself, considered as Word, has received and been glorified
   for His own sake, and if He according to His Godhead is He who is
   hallowed and has risen again, what hope is there for men? for they
   remain as they were, naked, and wretched, and dead, having no interest
   in the things given to the Son. Why too did the Word come among us, and
   become flesh? if that He might receive these things, which He says that
   He has received, He was without them before that, and of necessity will
   rather owe thanks Himself to the body [3080] , because, when He came
   into it, then He receives these things from the Father, which He had
   not before His descent into the flesh. For on this shewing He seems
   rather to be Himself promoted because of the body [3081] , than the
   body promoted because of Him. But this notion is Judaic. But if that He
   might redeem mankind [3082] , the Word did come among us; and that He
   might hallow and deify them, the Word became flesh (and for this He did
   become), who does not see that it follows, that what He says that He
   received, when He became flesh, that He mentions, not for His own sake,
   but for the flesh? for to it, in which He was speaking, pertained the
   gifts given through Him from the Father. But let us see what He asked,
   and what the things altogether were which He said that He had received,
   that in this way also they may be brought to feeling. He asked then
   glory, yet He had said, All things were delivered unto Me [3083] .' And
   after the resurrection, He says that He has received all power; but
   even before that He had said, All things were delivered unto Me,' He
   was Lord of all, for all things were made by Him;' and there is One
   Lord by whom are all things [3084] .' And when He asked glory, He was
   as He is, the Lord of glory; as Paul says, If they had known it, they
   would not have crucified the Lord of glory [3085] ;' for He had that
   glory which He asked when He said, the glory which I had with Thee
   before the world was [3086] .'

   40. Also the power which He said He received after the resurrection,
   that He had before He received it, and before the resurrection. For He
   of Himself rebuked Satan, saying, Get thee behind Me, Satan [3087] ;'
   and to the disciples He gave the power against him, when on their
   return He said, I beheld Satan, as lightning, fall from heaven [3088]
   .' And again, that what He said that He had received, that He possessed
   before receiving it, appears from His driving away the demons, and from
   His unbinding what Satan had bound, as He did in the case of the
   daughter of Abraham; and from His remitting sins, saying to the
   paralytic, and to the woman who washed His feet, Thy sins be forgiven
   thee [3089] ;' and from His both raising the dead, and repairing the
   first nature of the blind, granting to him to see. And all this He did,
   not waiting till He should receive, but being possessed of power [3090]
   .' From all this it is plain that what He had as Word, that when He had
   become man and was risen again, He says that He received humanly [3091]
   ; that for His sake men might henceforward upon earth have power
   against demons, as having become partakers of a divine nature; and in
   heaven, as being delivered from corruption, might reign everlastingly.
   Thus we must acknowledge this once for all, that nothing which He says
   that He received, did He receive as not possessing before; for the
   Word, as being God, had them always; but in these passages He is said
   humanly to have received, that, whereas the flesh received in Him,
   henceforth from it the gift might abide [3092] surely for us. For what
   is said by Peter, receiving from God honour and glory, Angels being
   made subject unto Him [3093] ,' has this meaning. As He inquired
   humanly, and raised Lazarus divinely, so He received' is spoken of Him
   humanly, but the subjection of the Angels marks the Word's Godhead.

   41. Cease then, O abhorred of God [3094] , and degrade not the Word;
   nor detract from His Godhead, which is the Father's [3095] , as though
   He needed or were ignorant; lest ye be casting your own arguments
   against the Christ, as the Jews who once stoned Him. For these belong
   not to the Word, as the Word; but are proper to men and, as when He
   spat, and stretched forth the hand, and called Lazarus, we did not say
   that the triumphs were human, though they were done through the body,
   but were God's, so, on the other hand, though human things are ascribed
   to the Saviour in the Gospel, let us, considering the nature of what is
   said and that they are foreign to God, not impute them to the Word's
   Godhead, but to His manhood. For though the Word became flesh,' yet to
   the flesh are the affections proper; and though the flesh is possessed
   by God in the Word, yet to the Word belong the grace and the power. He
   did then the Father's works through the flesh; and as truly
   contrariwise were the affections of the flesh displayed in Him; for
   instance, He inquired and He raised Lazarus, He chid [3096] His Mother,
   saying, My hour is not yet come,' and then at once He made the water
   wine. For He was Very God in the flesh, and He was true flesh in the
   Word. Therefore from His works He revealed both Himself as Son of God,
   and His own Father, and from the affections of the flesh He shewed that
   He bore a true body, and that it was His own.

   the Trinity in Unity. Nothing can be named which the Son is in Himself,
   as distinct from the Father; we are but told His relation towards the
   Father, and thus the sole meaning we are able to attach to Person is a
   relation of the Son towards the Father; and distinct from and beyond
   that relation, He is but the One God, who is also the Father. This
   sacred subject has been touched upon supr. Or. iii. 9, n. 8. In other
   words, there is an indestructible essential relation existing in the
   One Indivisible infinitely simple God, such as to constitute Him,
   viewed on each side of that relation (what in human language we call)
   Two (and in like manner Three), yet without the notion of number really
   coming in. When we speak of Person,' we mean nothing more than the One
   God in substance, viewed relatively to Him the One God, as viewed in
   that Correlative which we therefore call another Person. These various
   statements are not here intended to explain, but to bring home to the
   mind what it is which faith receives. We say Father, Son, and Spirit,'
   but when we would abstract a general idea of Them in order to number
   Them, our abstraction really does hardly more than carry us back to the
   One Substance. Such seems the meaning of such passages as Basil. Ep. 8,

   have a strong meaning or not, as the case may be.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XXVIII.--Texts Explained; Eleventhly, Mark xiii. 32 and Luke
   ii. 52 Arian explanation of the former text is against the Regula
   Fidei; and against the context. Our Lord said He was ignorant of the
   Day, by reason of His human nature. If the Holy Spirit knows the Day,
   therefore the Son knows; if the Son knows the Father, therefore He
   knows the Day; if He has all that is the Father's, therefore knowledge
   of the Day; if in the Father, He knows the Day in the Father; if He
   created and upholds all things, He knows when they will cease to be. He
   knows not as Man, argued from Matt. xxiv. 42. As He asked about
   Lazarus's grave, &c., yet knew, so He knows; as S. Paul says, whether
   in the body I know not,' &c., yet knew, so He knows. He said He knew
   not for our profit, that we be not curious (as in Acts i. 7, where on
   the contrary He did not say He knew not). As the Almighty asks of Adam
   and of Cain, yet knew, so the Son knows[as God]. Again, He advanced in
   wisdom also as man, else He made Angels perfect before Himself. He
   advanced, in that the Godhead was manifested in Him more fully as time
   went on.

   42. These things being so, come let us now examine into But of that day
   and that hour knoweth no man, neither the Angels of God, nor the Son
   [3097] ;' for being in great ignorance as regards these words, and
   being stupefied [3098] about them, they think they have in them an
   important argument for their heresy. But I, when the heretics allege it
   and prepare themselves with it, see in them the giants [3099] again
   fighting against God. For the Lord of heaven and earth, by whom all
   things were made, has to litigate before them about day and hour; and
   the Word who knows all things is accused by them of ignorance about a
   day; and the Son who knows the Father is said to be ignorant of an hour
   of a day; now what can be spoken more contrary to sense, or what
   madness can be likened to this? Through the Word all things have been
   made, times and seasons and night and day and the whole creation; and
   is the Framer of all said to be ignorant of His work? And the very
   context of the lection shews that the Son of God knows that hour and
   that day, though the Arians fall headlong in their ignorance. For after
   saying, nor the Son,' He relates to the disciples what precedes the
   day, saying, This and that shall be, and then the end.' But He who
   speaks of what precedes the day, knows certainly the day also, which
   shall be manifested subsequently to the things foretold. But if He had
   not known the hour, He had not signified the events before it, as not
   knowing when it should be. And as any one, who, by way of pointing out
   a house or city to those who were ignorant of it, gave an account of
   what comes before the house or city, and having described all, said,
   Then immediately comes the city or the house,' would know of course
   where the house or the city was (for had he not known, he had not
   described what comes before lest from ignorance he should throw his
   hearers far out of the way, or in speaking he should unawares go beyond
   the object), so the Lord saying what precedes that day and that hour,
   knows exactly, nor is ignorant, when the hour and the day are at hand.

   43. Now why it was that, though He knew, He did not tell His disciples
   plainly at that time, no one may be curious [3100] where He has been
   silent; for Who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His
   counsellor [3101] ?' but why, though He knew, He said, no, not the Son
   knows,' this I think none of the faithful is ignorant, viz. that He
   made this as those other declarations as man by reason of the flesh.
   For this as before is not the Word's deficiency [3102] , but of that
   human nature [3103] whose property it is to be ignorant. And this again
   will be well seen by honestly examining into the occasion, when and to
   whom the Saviour spoke thus. Not then when the heaven was made by Him,
   nor when He was with the Father Himself, the Word disposing all things
   [3104] ,' nor before He became man did He say it, but when the Word
   became flesh [3105] .' On this account it is reasonable to ascribe to
   His manhood everything which, after He became man, He speaks humanly.
   For it is proper to the Word to know what was made, nor be ignorant
   either of the beginning or of the end of these (for the works are His),
   and He knows how many things He wrought, and the limit of their
   consistence. And knowing of each the beginning and the end, He knows
   surely the general and common end of all. Certainly when He says in the
   Gospel concerning Himself in His human character, Father, the hour is
   come, glorify Thy Son [3106] ,' it is plain that He knows also the hour
   of the end of all things, as the Word, though as man He is ignorant of
   it, for ignorance is proper to man [3107] , and especially ignorance of
   these things. Moreover this is proper to the Saviour's love of man; for
   since He was made man, He is not ashamed, because of the flesh which is
   ignorant [3108] , to say I know not,' that He may shew that knowing as
   God, He is but ignorant according to the flesh [3109] . And therefore
   He said not, no, not the Son of God knows,' lest the Godhead should
   seem ignorant, but simply, no, not the Son,' that the ignorance might
   be the Son's as born from among men.

   44. On this account, He alludes to the Angels, but He did not go
   further and say, not the Holy Ghost;' but He was silent, with a double
   intimation; first that if the Spirit knew, much more must the Word
   know, considered as the Word, from whom the Spirit receives [3110] ;
   and next by His silence about the Spirit, He made it clear, that He
   said of His human ministry, no, not the Son.' And a proof of it is
   this; that, when He had spoken humanly [3111] No, not the Son knows,'
   He yet shews that divinely He knew all things. For that Son whom He
   declares not to know the day, Him He declares to know the Father; for
   No one,' He says, knoweth the Father save the Son [3112] .' And all men
   but the Arians would join in confessing, that He who knows the Father,
   much more knows the whole of the creation; and in that whole, its end.
   And if already the day and the hour be determined by the Father, it is
   plain that through the Son are they determined, and He knows Himself
   what through Him has been determined [3113] , for there is nothing but
   has come to be and has been determined through the Son. Therefore He,
   being the Framer of the universe, knows of what nature, and of what
   magnitude, and with what limits, the Father has willed it to be made;
   and in the how much and how far is included its period. And again, if
   all that is the Father's, is the Son's (and this He Himself has [3114]
   said), and it is the Father's attribute to know the day, it is plain
   that the Son too knows it, having this proper to Him from the Father.
   And again, if the Son be in the Father and the Father in the Son, and
   the Father knows the day and the hour, it is clear that the Son, being
   in the Father and knowing the things of the Father, knows Himself also
   the day and the hour. And if the Son is also the Father's Very Image,
   and the Father knows the day and the hour, it is plain that the Son has
   this likeness [3115] also to the Father of knowing them. And it is not
   wonderful if He, through whom all things were made, and in whom the
   universe consists, Himself knows what has been brought to be, and when
   the end will be of each and of all together; rather is it wonderful
   that this audacity, suitable as it is to the madness of the
   Ario-maniacs, should have forced us to have recourse to so long a
   defence. For ranking the Son of God, the Eternal Word, among things
   originate, they are not far from venturing to maintain that the Father
   Himself is second to the creation; for if He who knows the Father knows
   not the day nor the hour, I fear lest the knowledge of the creation, or
   rather of the lower portion of it, be greater, as they in their madness
   would say, than knowledge concerning the Father.

   45. But for them, when they thus blaspheme the Spirit, they must expect
   no remission ever of such irreligion, as the Lord has said [3116] ; but
   let us, who love Christ and bear Christ within us, know that the Word,
   not as ignorant, considered as Word, has said I know not,' for He
   knows, but as shewing His manhood [3117] , in that to be ignorant is
   proper to man, and that He had put on flesh that was ignorant [3118] ,
   being in which, He said according to the flesh, I know not.' And for
   this reason, after saying, No not the Son knows,' and mentioning the
   ignorance of the men in Noah's day, immediately He added, Watch
   therefore, for ye know not in what hour your Lord doth come,' and
   again, In such an hour as ye think not, the Son of man cometh [3119] .'
   For I too, having become as you for you, said no, not the Son.' For,
   had He been ignorant divinely, He must have said, Watch therefore, for
   I know not,' and, In an hour when I think not;' but in fact this hath
   He not said; but by saying Ye know not' and When ye think not,' He has
   signified that it belongs to man to be ignorant; for whose sake He too
   having a flesh like theirs and having become man, said No, not the Son
   knows,' for He knew not in flesh, though knowing as Word. And again the
   example from Noah exposes the shamelessness of Christ's enemies; for
   there too He said not, I knew not,' but They knew not until the flood
   came [3120] .' For men did not know, but He who brought the flood (and
   it was the Saviour Himself) knew the day and the hour in which He
   opened the cataracts of heaven and broke up the great deep, and said to
   Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark [3121] .' For were He
   ignorant, He had not foretold to Noah, Yet seven days and I will bring
   a flood upon the earth.' But if in describing the day He makes use of
   the parallel of Noah's time, and He did know the day of the flood,
   therefore He knows also the day of His own coming.

   46. Moreover, after narrating the parable of the Virgins, again He
   shews more clearly who they are who are ignorant of the day and the
   hour, saying, Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour
   [3122] .' He who said shortly before, No one knoweth, no not the Son,'
   now says not I know not,' but ye know not.' In like manner then, when
   His disciples asked about the end, suitably said He then, no, nor the
   Son,' according to the flesh because of the body; that He might shew
   that, as man, He knows not; for ignorance is proper to man [3123] . If
   however He is the Word, if it is He who is to come, He to be Judge, He
   to be the Bridegroom, He knoweth when and in what hour He cometh, and
   when He is to say, Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead,
   and Christ shall give thee light [3124] .' For as, on becoming man, He
   hungers and thirsts and suffers with men, so with men as man He knows
   not; though divinely, being in the Father Word and Wisdom, He knows,
   and there is nothing which He knows not. In like manner also about
   Lazarus [3125] He asks humanly, who was on His way to raise him, and
   knew whence He should recall Lazarus's soul; and it was a greater thing
   to know where the soul was, than to know where the body lay; but He
   asked humanly, that He might raise divinely. So too He asks of the
   disciples, on coming into the parts of CÃ¦sarea, though knowing even
   before Peter made answer. For if the Father revealed to Peter the
   answer to the Lord's question, it is plain that through the Son [3126]
   was the revelation, for No one knoweth the Son,' saith He, save the
   Father, neither the Father save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son
   will reveal Him [3127] .' But if through the Son is revealed the
   knowledge both of the Father and the Son, there is no room for doubting
   that the Lord who asked, having first revealed it to Peter from the
   Father, next asked humanly; in order to shew, that asking after the
   flesh, He knew divinely what Peter was about to say. The Son then knew,
   as knowing all things, and knowing His own Father, than which knowledge
   nothing can be greater or more perfect.

   47. This is sufficient to confute them; but to shew still further that
   they are hostile to the truth and Christ's enemies, I could wish to ask
   them a question. The Apostle in the Second Epistle to the Corinthians
   writes, I knew a man in Christ, above fourteen years ago, whether in
   the body I do not know, or whether out of the body I do not know; God
   knoweth [3128] .' What now say ye? Knew the Apostle what had happened
   to him in the vision, though he says I know not,' or knew he not? If he
   knew not, see to it, lest, being familiar with error, ye err in the
   trespass [3129] of the Phrygians [3130] , who say that the Prophets and
   the other ministers of the Word know neither what they do nor
   concerning what they announce. But if he knew when he said I know not,'
   for he had Christ within him revealing to him all things, is not the
   heart of God's enemies indeed perverted and self-condemned?' for when
   the Apostle says, I know not,' they say that he knows; but when the
   Lord says, I know not,' they say that He does not know. For if since
   Christ was within him, Paul knew that of which he says, I know not,'
   does not much more Christ Himself know, though He say, I know not?' The
   Apostle then, the Lord revealing it to him, knew what happened to him;
   for on this account he says, I knew a man in Christ;' and knowing the
   man, he knew also how the man was caught away. Thus Elisha, who beheld
   Elijah, knew also how he was taken up; but though knowing, yet when the
   sons of the Prophets thought that Elijah was cast upon one of the
   mountains by the Spirit, he knowing from the first what he had seen,
   tried to persuade them; but when they urged it, he was silent, and
   suffered them to go after him. Did he then not know, because he was
   silent? he knew indeed, but as if not knowing, he suffered them, that
   they being convinced, might no more doubt about the taking up of
   Elijah. Therefore much more Paul, himself being the person caught away,
   knew also how he was caught; for Elijah knew; and had any one asked, he
   would have said how. And yet Paul says I know not,' for these two
   reasons, as I think at least; one, as he has said himself, lest because
   of the abundance of the revelations any one should think of him beyond
   what he saw; the other, because, our Saviour having said I know not,'
   it became him also to say I know not,' lest the servant should appear
   above his Lord, and the disciple above his Master.

   48. Therefore He who gave to Paul to know, much rather knew Himself;
   for since He spoke of the antecedents of the day, He also knew, as I
   said before, when the Day and when the Hour, and yet though knowing, He
   says, No, not the Son knoweth.' Why then said He at that time I know
   not,' what He as Lord [3131] , knew? as we may by searching conjecture,
   for our profit [3132] , as I think at least, did He this; and may He
   grant to what we are now proposing a true meaning! On both sides did
   the Saviour secure our advantage; for He has made known what comes
   before the end, that, as He said Himself, we might not be startled nor
   scared, when they happen, but from them may expect the end after them.
   And concerning the day and the hour He was not willing to say according
   to His divine nature, I know,' but after the flesh, I know not,' for
   the sake of the flesh which was ignorant [3133] , as I have said
   before; lest they should ask Him further, and then either He should
   have to pain the disciples by not speaking, or by speaking might act to
   the prejudice of them and us all. For whatever He does, that altogether
   He does for our sakes, since also for us the Word became flesh.' For us
   therefore He said No, not the Son knoweth;' and neither was He untrue
   in thus saying (for He said humanly, as man, I know not'), nor did He
   suffer the disciples to force Him to speak, for by saying I know not'
   He stopped their inquiries. And so in the Acts of the Apostles it is
   written, when He went upon the Angels, ascending as man, and carrying
   up to heaven the flesh which He bore, on the disciples seeing this, and
   again asking, When shall the end be, and when wilt Thou be present?' He
   said to them more clearly, It is not for you to know the times or the
   seasons which the Father hath put in His own power [3134] .' And He did
   not then say, No, not the Son,' as He said before humanly, but, It is
   not for you to know.' For now the flesh had risen and put off its
   mortality and been deified; and no longer did it become Him to answer
   after the flesh when He was going into the heavens; but henceforth to
   teach after a divine manner, It is not for you to know times or seasons
   which the Father hath put in His own power; but ye shall receive Power
   [3135] .' And what is that Power of the Father but the Son? for Christ
   is God's Power and God's Wisdom.'

   49. The Son then did know, as being the Word; for He implied this in
   what He said,--I know but it is not for you to know;' for it was for
   your sakes that sitting also on the mount I said according to the
   flesh, No, not the Son knoweth,' for the profit of you and all. For it
   is profitable to you to hear so much both of the Angels and of the Son,
   because of the deceivers which shall be afterwards; that though demons
   should be transfigured as Angels, and should attempt to speak
   concerning the end, you should not believe, since they are ignorant;
   and that, if Antichrist too, disguising himself, should say, I am
   Christ,' and should try in his turn to speak of that day and end, to
   deceive the hearers, ye, having these words from Me, No, not the Son,'
   may disbelieve him also. And further, not to know when the end is, or
   when the day of the end, is expedient for man, lest knowing, they might
   become negligent of the time between, awaiting the days near the end;
   for they will argue that then only must they attend to themselves
   [3136] . Therefore also has He been silent of the time when each shall
   die, lest men, being elated on the ground of knowledge, should
   forthwith neglect themselves for the greater part of their time. Both
   then, the end of all things and the limit of each of us hath the Word
   concealed from us (for in the end of all is the end of each, and in the
   end of each the end of all is comprehended), that, whereas it is
   uncertain and always in prospect, we may advance day by day as if
   summoned, reaching forward to the things before us and forgetting the
   things behind [3137] . For who, knowing the day of the end, would not
   be dilatory with the interval? but, if ignorant, would not be ready day
   by day? It was on this account that the Saviour added, Watch therefore,
   for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come;' and, In such an hour as
   ye think not, the Son of man cometh [3138] .' For the advantage then
   which comes of ignorance has He said this; for in saying it, He wishes
   that we should always be prepared; for you,' He says, know not; but I,
   the Lord, know when I come, though the Arians do not wait for Me, who
   am the Word of the Father.'

   50. The Lord then, knowing what is good for us beyond ourselves, thus
   secured the disciples; and they, being thus taught, set right those of
   Thessalonica [3139] when likely on this point to run into error.
   However, since Christ's enemies do not yield even to these
   considerations, I wish, though knowing that they have a heart harder
   than Pharaoh, to ask them again concerning this. In Paradise God asks,
   Adam, where art Thou [3140] ' and He inquires of Cain also, Where is
   Abel thy brother [3141] ?' What then say you to this? for if you think
   Him ignorant and therefore to have asked, you are already of the party
   of the Manichees, for this is their bold thought; but if, fearing the
   open name, ye force yourselves to say, that He asks knowing, what is
   there extravagant or strange in the doctrine, that ye should thus fall,
   on finding that the Son, in whom God then inquired, that same Son who
   now is clad in flesh, inquires of the disciples as man? unless
   forsooth, having become Manichees, you are willing to blame [3142] the
   question then put to Adam and all that you may give full play [3143] to
   your perverseness. For being exposed on all sides, you still make a
   whispering [3144] from the words of Luke, which are rightly said, but
   ill understood by you. And what this is, we must state, that so also
   their corrupt [3145] meaning may be shewn.

   51. Now Luke says, And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature, and in
   grace with God and man [3146] .' This then is the passage, and since
   they stumble in it, we are compelled to ask them, like the Pharisees
   and the Sadducees, of the person concerning whom Luke speaks. And the
   case stands thus. Is Jesus Christ man, as all other men, or is He God
   bearing flesh? If then He is an ordinary [3147] man as the rest, then
   let Him, as a man, advance; this however is the sentiment of the
   Samosatene, which virtually indeed you entertain also, though in name
   you deny it because of men. But if He be God bearing flesh, as He truly
   is, and the Word became flesh,' and being God descended upon earth,
   what advance had He who existed equal to God? or how had the Son
   increase, being ever in the Father? For if He who was ever in the
   Father, advanced, what, I ask, is there beyond the Father from which
   His advance might be made? Next it is suitable here to repeat what was
   said upon the point of His receiving and being glorified. If He
   advanced [3148] when He became man, it is plain that, before He became
   man, He was imperfect; and rather the flesh became to Him a cause of
   perfection, than He to the flesh. And again, if, as being the Word, He
   advances, what has He more to become than Word and Wisdom and Son and
   God's Power? For the Word is all these, of which if one can anyhow
   partake as it were one ray, such a man becomes all perfect among men,
   and equal to Angels. For Angels, and Archangels, and Dominions, and all
   the Powers, and Thrones, as partaking the Word, behold always the face
   of His Father. How then does He who to others supplies perfection,
   Himself advance later than they? For Angels even ministered to His
   human birth, and the passage from Luke comes later than the
   ministration of the Angels. How then at all can it even come into
   thought of man? or how did Wisdom advance in wisdom? or how did He who
   to others gives grace (as Paul says in every Epistle, knowing that
   through Him grace is given, The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with
   you all'), how did He advance in grace? for either let them say that
   the Apostle is untrue, and presume to say that the Son is not Wisdom,
   or else if He is Wisdom as Solomon said, and if Paul wrote, Christ
   God's Power and God's Wisdom,' of what advance did Wisdom admit
   further?

   52. For men, creatures as they are, are capable in a certain way of
   reaching forward and advancing in virtue [3149] . Enoch, for instance,
   was thus translated, and Moses increased and was perfected; and Isaac
   by advancing became great [3150] ;' and the Apostle said that he
   reached forth [3151] ' day by day to what was before him. For each had
   room for advancing, looking to the step before him. But the Son of God,
   who is One and Only, what room had He for reaching forward? for all
   things advance by looking at Him; and He, being One and Only, is in the
   Only Father, from whom again He does not reach forward, but in Him
   abideth ever [3152] . To men then belongs advance; but the Son of God,
   since He could not advance, being perfect in the Father, humbled
   Himself for us, that in His humbling we on the other hand might be able
   to increase. And our increase is no other than the renouncing things
   sensible, and coming to the Word Himself; since His humbling is nothing
   else than His taking our flesh. It was not then the Word, considered as
   the Word, who advanced; who is perfect from the perfect Father [3153] ,
   who needs nothing, nay brings forward others to an advance; but humanly
   is He here also said to advance, since advance belongs to man [3154] .
   Hence the Evangelist, speaking with cautious exactness [3155] , has
   mentioned stature in the advance; but being Word and God He is not
   measured by stature, which belongs to bodies. Of the body then is the
   advance; for, it advancing, in it advanced also the manifestation
   [3156] of the Godhead to those who saw it. And, as the Godhead was more
   and more revealed, by so much more did His grace as man increase before
   all men. For as a child He was carried to the Temple; and when He
   became a boy, He remained there, and questioned the priests about the
   Law. And by degrees His body increasing, and the Word manifesting
   Himself [3157] in it, He is confessed henceforth by Peter first, then
   also by all, Truly this is the Son of God [3158] ;' however wilfully
   the Jews, both the ancient and these modern [3159] , shut fast their
   eyes, lest they see that to advance in wisdom is not the advance of
   Wisdom Itself, but rather the manhood's advance in It. For Jesus
   advanced in wisdom and grace;' and, if we may speak what is explanatory
   as well as true, He advanced in Himself; for Wisdom builded herself an
   house,' and in herself she gave the house advancement.

   53. (What moreover is this advance that is spoken of, but, as I said
   before, the deifying and grace imparted from Wisdom to men, sin being
   obliterated in them and their inward corruption, according to their
   likeness and relationship to the flesh of the Word?) For thus, the body
   increasing in stature, there developed in it the manifestation of the
   Godhead also, and to all was it displayed that the body was God's
   Temple [3160] , and that God was in the body. And if they urge, that
   The Word become flesh' is called Jesus, and refer to Him the term
   advanced,' they must be told that neither does this impair [3161] the
   Father's Light [3162] , which is the Son, but that it still shews that
   the Word has become man, and bore true flesh. And as we said [3163]
   that He suffered in the flesh, and hungered in the flesh, and was
   fatigued in the flesh, so also reasonably may He be said to have
   advanced in the flesh; for neither did the advance, such as we have
   described it, take place with the Word external to the flesh, for in
   Him was the flesh which advanced and His is it called, and that as
   before, that man's advance might abide [3164] and fail not, because of
   the Word which is with it. Neither then was the advance the Word's, nor
   was the flesh Wisdom, but the flesh became the body of Wisdom [3165] .
   Therefore, as we have already said, not Wisdom, as Wisdom, advanced in
   respect of Itself; but the manhood advanced in Wisdom, transcending by
   degrees human nature, and being deified, and becoming and appearing to
   all as the organ [3166] of Wisdom for the operation and the shining
   forth [3167] of the Godhead. Wherefore neither said he, The Word
   advanced,' but Jesus, by which Name the Lord was called when He became
   man; so that the advance is of the human nature in such wise as we
   explained above.

   [3106] Ib. xvii. 1.

   [3107] Though our Lord, as having two natures, had a human as well as a
   divine knowledge, and though that human knowledge was not only limited
   because human, but liable to ignorance in matters in which greater
   knowledge was possible; yet it is the doctrine of the [later] Church,
   that in fact He was not ignorant even in His human nature, according to
   its capacity, since it was from the first taken out of its original and
   natural condition, and deified' by its union with the Word. As then
   (supr. ii. 45, note 1) His manhood was created, yet He may not be
   called a creature even in His manhood, and as (supr. ii. 14, note 5)
   His flesh was in its abstract nature a servant, yet He is not a servant
   in fact, even as regards the flesh; so, though He took on Him a soul
   which left to itself had been partially ignorant, as other human souls,
   yet as ever enjoying the beatific vision from its oneness with the
   Word, it never was ignorant really, but knew all things which human
   soul can know. vid. Eulog. ap. Phot. 230. p. 884. As Pope Gregory
   expresses it, Novit in natura, non ex natura humanitatis.' Epp. x. 39.
   However, this view of the sacred subject was received by the Church
   only after S. Athanasius's day, and it cannot be denied that others of
   the most eminent Fathers seem to impute ignorance to our Lord as man,
   as Athan. in this passage. Of course it is not meant that our Lord's
   soul has the same perfect knowledge as He has as God. This was the
   assertion of a General of the Hermits of S. Austin at the time of the
   Council of Basel, when the proposition was formally condemned, animam
   Christi Deum videre tam clare et intense quam clare et intense Deus
   videt seipsum. vid. Berti Opp. t. 3. p. 42. Yet Fulgentius had said, I
   think that in no respect was full knowledge of the Godhead wanting to
   that Soul, whose Person is one with the Word: whom Wisdom so assumed
   that it is itself that same Wisdom.' ad Ferrand. iii. p. 223. ed. 1639.
   Yet, ad Trasmund. i. 7. he speaks of ignorance attaching to our Lord's
   human nature.

   [3108] Cf. Â§48.

   [3109] And so Athan. ad Serap. ii. 9. S. Basil on the question being
   asked him by S. Amphilochius, says that he shall give him the answer he
   had heard from a boy from the fathers,' but which was more fitted for
   pious Christians than for cavillers, and that is, that our Lord says
   many things to men in His human aspect; as "Give me to drink,"...yet He
   who asked was not flesh without a soul, but Godhead using flesh which
   had one.' Ep. 236, 1. He goes on to suggest another explanation which
   has been mentioned Â§42, note 1. Cf. Cyril Trin. pp. 623, 4. vid. also
   Thes. p. 220. As he submitted as man to hunger and thirst, so....to be
   ignorant." p. 221. vid. also Greg. Naz. Orat. 30, 15. Theodoret
   expresses the same opinion very strongly, speaking of a gradual
   revelation to the manhood from the Godhead, but in an argument where it
   was to his point to do so; in Anath. 4. t. v. p. 23. ed. Schulze.
   Theodore of Mopsuestia also speaks of a revelation made by the Word.

   [3111] Leporius, in his Retractation, which S. Augustine subscribed,
   writes, That I may in this respect also leave nothing to be cause of
   suspicion to any one, I then said, nay I answered when it was put to
   me, that our Lord Jesus Christ was ignorant as He was man, (secundum
   hominem). But now not only do I not presume to say so, but I even
   anathematize my former opinion expressed on this point,' ap. Sirm. t.
   i. p. 210. A subdivision also of the Eutychians were called by the name
   of AgnoetÃ¦ from their holding that our Lord was ignorant of the day of
   judgment. They said,' says Leontius, that He was ignorant of it, as we
   say that He underwent toil.' de Sect. 5. circ. fin. Felix of Urgela
   held the same doctrine according to Agobard's testimony, see Â§46, n. 2.
   Montfaucon observes on the text, that the assertion of our Lord's
   ignorance seems to have been condemned in no one in ancient times,
   unless joined to other error.' And Petavius, after drawing out the
   authorities for and against it, says, Of these two opinions, the
   latter, which is now received both by custom and by the agreement of
   divines, is deservedly preferred to the former. For it is more
   agreeable to Christ's dignity, and more befitting His character and
   office of Mediator and Head, that is, Fountain of all grace and wisdom,
   and moreover of Judge, who is concerned in knowing the time fixed for
   exercising that function. In consequence, the former opinion, though
   formerly it received the countenance of some men of high eminence, was
   afterwards marked as a heresy.' Incarn. xi. 1. Â§15.

   eikon, sphragis, boule, energeia, when speaking of our Lord, e.g. Naz.
   Orat. 30, 20, c. Vid. Â§63, fin. note.

   [3116] Or. i. 50, n. 7.

   [3117] It is a question to be decided, whether our Lord speaks of
   actual ignorance in His human Mind, or of the natural ignorance of that
   Mind considered as human; ignorance in or ex natura; or, which comes to
   the same thing, whether He spoke of a real ignorance, or of an
   economical or professed ignorance, in a certain view of His incarnation
   or office, as when He asked, How many loaves have ye?' when He Himself
   knew what He would do,' or as He is called sin, though sinless. Thus it
   has been noticed, supr. ii. 55, n. 7, that Ath. seems to make His
   infirmities altogether only imputative, not real, as if shewing that
   the subject had not in his day been thoroughly worked out. In like
   manner S. Hilary, who, if the passage be genuine, states so clearly our
   Lord's ignorance, de Trin. ix. fin. yet, as Petavius observes, seems
   elsewhere to deny to Him those very affections of the flesh to which he
   has there paralleled it. And this view of Athan.'s meaning is favoured
   by the turn of his expressions. He says such a defect belongs to that
   human nature whose property it is to be ignorant;' Â§43. that since He
   was made man, He is not ashamed, because of the flesh which is
   ignorant, to say, "I know not;"' ibid. and, as here, that as shewing
   His manhood, in that to be ignorant is proper to man, and that He had
   put on a flesh that was ignorant, being in which, He said according to
   the flesh, "I know not;"' that He might shew that as man He knows not;'
   Â§46. that as man' (i.e. on the ground of being man, not in the capacity
   of man), He knows not;' ibid. and that, He asks about Lazarus humanly,'
   even when He was on His way to raise him,' which implied surely
   knowledge in His human nature. The reference to the parallel of S.
   Paul's professed ignorance when he really knew, Â§47. leads us to the
   same suspicion. And so for our profit as I think, did He this.'
   Â§Â§48-50. The natural want of precision on such questions in the early
   ages was shewn or fostered by such words as oikonomikos, which, in
   respect of this very text, is used by S. Basil to denote both our
   Lord's Incarnation, Ep. 236, 1 fin. and His gracious accommodation of
   Himself and His truth, Ep. 8, 6. and with the like variety of meaning,
   with reference to the same text, by Cyril. Trin. p. 623. and Thesaur.
   p. 224. (And the word dispensatio in like manner, Ben. note on Hil. x.
   8.) In the latter Ep. S. Basil suggests that our Lord economizes by a
   feigned ignorance.' Â§6. And S. Cyril. Thesaur. p. 224. And even in de
   Trin. vi. he seems to recognise the distinction laid down just now
   between the natural and actual state of our Lord's humanity; and so
   Hilary, Trin. ix. 62. And he gives reasons why He professed ignorance,
   n. 67. viz. as S. Austin words it, Christum se dixisse nescientem, in
   quo alios facit occultando nescientes. Ep. 180, 3. S. Austin follows
   him, saying, Hoc nescit quod nescienter facit. Trin. i. 23. Pope
   Gregory says that the text is most certainly to be referred to the Son
   not as He is Head, but as to His body which we are.' Ep x. 39. And S.
   Ambrose de fid. v. 222. And so CÃ¦sarius, Qu. 20. and Photius Epp. p.
   366. Chrysost. in Matt. Hom. 77, 3. Theodoret, however, but in
   controversy, is very severe on the principle of Economy. If He knew the
   day, and wishing to conceal it, said He was ignorant, see what a
   blasphemy is the result. Truth tells an untruth.' l. c, pp. 23, 4.

   [3123] The mode in which Athan. here expresses himself, is as if he did
   not ascribe ignorance literally, but apparent ignorance, to our Lord's
   soul, vid. supr. 45. n. 2; not certainly in the broad sense in which
   heretics have done so. As Leontius, e.g. reports of Theodore of
   Mopsuestia, that he considered Christ to be ignorant so far, as not to
   know, when He was tempted, who tempted Him;' contr. Nest. iii. (Canis.
   t. i. p. 579.) and Agobard of Felix the Adoptionist that he held Our
   Lord Jesus Christ according to the flesh truly to have been ignorant of
   the sepulchre of Lazarus, when He said to his sisters, Where have ye
   laid him?' and was truly ignorant of the day of judgment; and was truly
   ignorant what the two disciples were saying, as they walked by the way,
   of what had been done at Jerusalem; and was truly ignorant whether He
   was more loved by Peter than by the other disciples, when He said,
   Simon Peter, Lovest thou Me more than these?' B. P. t. 9. p. 1177. [Cf.

   Eusebius, Hist. v. 16. Epiphanius too, noticing the failure of
   Maximilla's prophecies, says, Whatever the prophets have said, they
   spoke with understanding, following the sense.' HÃ¦r. 48. p. 403. In the
   de Syn. 4. Athan. speaks of the Montanists as making a fresh beginning
   of Christianity; i.e. they were the first heretics who professed to
   prophesy and to introduce a new or additional revelation.

   [3132] This expression, which repeatedly occurs in this and the
   following sections, surely implies that there was something economical
   in our Lord's profession of ignorance. He said with a purpose, not as a
   mere plain fact or doctrine. [But see Prolegg. ch. iv. Â§5.]

   [3149] It is the doctrine of the [medieval and modern] Church that

   ignorance were hardly separable from sin, and were the direct
   consequence or accompaniment of original sin. Cf. Aug. de Pecc. Mer.
   ii. 48. As to the limits of Christ's perfect knowledge as man, Petavius
   observes, that we must consider that the soul of Christ knew all things
   that are or ever will be or ever have been, but not what are only in
   posse, not in fact.' Incarn. xi. 3, 6.

   [3157] It is remarkable, considering the tone of his statements in the
   present chapter, that here and in what follows Athan. should resolve
   our Lord's advance in wisdom merely to its gradual manifestation
   through the flesh [but he says expressly the Manhood advanced in
   wisdom!'] and it increases the proof that his statements are not to be
   taken in the letter, and as if fully brought out and settled. Naz. says
   the same, Ep. ad Cled. 101. p. 86. which is the more remarkable since
   he is chiefly writing against the Apollinarians, who considered a
   phanerosis the great end of our Lord's coming; and Cyril. c. Nest. iii.

   Chapter XXIX.--Texts Explained; Twelfthly, Matthew xxvi. 39; John xii.
   27, &c. Arian inferences are against the Regula Fidei, as before. He
   wept and the like, as man. Other texts prove Him God. God could not
   fear. He feared because His flesh feared.

   54. Therefore as, when the flesh advanced, He is said to have advanced,
   because the body was His own, so also what is said at the season of His
   death, that He was troubled, that He wept, must be taken in the same
   sense [3168] . For they, going up and down [3169] , as if thereby
   recommending their heresy anew, allege; "Behold, He wept,' and said,
   Now is My soul troubled,' and He besought that the cup might pass away;
   how then, if He so spoke, is He God, and Word of the Father?" Yea, it
   is written that He wept, O God's enemies, and that He said, I am
   troubled,' and on the Cross He said, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani,'
   that is, My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?' and He besought
   that the cup might pass away [3170] . Thus certainly it is written; but
   again I would ask you (for the same rejoinder must of necessity be made
   to each of your objections [3171] ), If the speaker is mere man, let
   him weep and fear death, as being man; but if He is the Word in flesh
   [3172] (for one must not be reluctant to repeat), whom had He to fear
   being God? or wherefore should He fear death, who was Himself Life, and
   was rescuing others from death? or how, whereas He said, Fear not him
   that kills the body [3173] ,' should He Himself fear? And how should He
   who said to Abraham, Fear not, for I am with thee,' and encouraged
   Moses against Pharaoh, and said to the son of Nun, Be strong, and of a
   good courage [3174] ,' Himself feel terror before Herod and Pilate?
   Further, He who succours others against fear (for the Lord,' says
   Scripture, is on my side, I will not fear what man shall do unto me
   [3175] '), did He fear governors, mortal men? did He who Himself was
   come against death, feel terror of death? Is it not both unseemly and
   irreligious to say that He was terrified at death or hades, whom the
   keepers of the gates of hades [3176] saw and shuddered? But if, as you
   would hold, the Word was in terror wherefore, when He spoke long before
   of the conspiracy of the Jews, did He not flee, nay said when actually
   sought, I am He?' for He could have avoided death, as He said, I have
   power to lay down My life, and I have power to take it again;' and No
   one taketh it from Me [3177] .'

   55. But these affections were not proper to the nature of the Word, as
   far as He was Word; but in the flesh which was thus affected was the
   Word, O Christ's enemies and unthankful Jews! For He said not all this
   prior to the flesh; but when the Word became flesh,' and has become
   man, then is it written that He said this, that is, humanly. Surely He
   of whom this is written was He who raised Lazarus from the dead, and
   made the water wine, and vouchsafed sight to the man born blind, and
   said, I and My Father are one [3178] .' If then they make His human
   attributes a ground for low thoughts concerning the Son of God, nay
   consider Him altogether man from the earth, and not [3179] from heaven,
   wherefore not from His divine works recognise the Word who is in the
   Father, and henceforward renounce their self-willed [3180] irreligion?
   For they are given to see, how He who did the works is the same as He
   who shewed that His body was passible by His permitting [3181] it to
   weep and hunger, and to shew other properties of a body. For while by
   means of such He made it known that, though God impassible, He had
   taken a passible flesh; yet from the works He shewed Himself the Word
   of God, who had afterwards become man, saying, Though ye believe not
   Me, beholding Me clad in a human body, yet believe the works, that ye
   may know that "I am in the Father, and the Father in Me. [3182] " And
   Christ's enemies seem to me to shew plain shamelessness and blasphemy;'
   for, when they hear I and the Father are one [3183] ,' they violently
   distort the sense, and separate the unity of the Father and the Son;
   but reading of His tears or sweat or sufferings, they do not advert to
   His body, but on account of these rank in the creation Him by whom the
   creation was made. What then is left for them to differ from the Jews
   in? for as the Jews blasphemously ascribed God's works to Beelzebub, so
   also will these, ranking with the creatures the Lord who wrought those
   works, undergo the same condemnation as theirs without mercy.

   56. But they ought, when they hear I and the Father are one,' to see in
   Him the oneness of the Godhead and the propriety of the Father's
   Essence; and again when they hear, He wept' and the like, to say that
   these are proper to the body; especially since on each side they have
   an intelligible ground, viz. that this is written as of God and that
   with reference to His manhood. For in the incorporeal, the properties
   of body had not been, unless He had taken a body corruptible and mortal
   [3184] ; for mortal was Holy Mary, from whom was His body. Wherefore of
   necessity when He was in a body suffering, and weeping, and toiling,
   these things which are proper to the flesh, are ascribed to Him
   together with the body. If then He wept and was troubled, it was not
   the Word, considered as the Word, who wept and was troubled, but it was
   proper to the flesh; and if too He besought that the cup might pass
   away, it was not the Godhead that was in terror, but this affection too
   was proper to the manhood. And that the words Why hast Thou forsaken
   Me?' are His, according to the foregoing explanations (though He
   suffered nothing, for the Word was impassible), is notwithstanding
   declared by the Evangelists; since the Lord became man, and these
   things are done and said as from a man, that He might Himself lighten
   [3185] these very sufferings of the flesh, and free it from them [3186]
   . Whence neither can the Lord be forsaken by the Father, who is ever in
   the Father, both before He spoke, and when He uttered this cry. Nor is
   it lawful to say that the Lord was in terror, at whom the keepers of
   hell's gates shuddered [3187] and set open hell, and the graves did
   gape, and many bodies of the saints arose and appeared to their own
   people [3188] . Therefore be every heretic dumb, nor dare to ascribe
   terror to the Lord whom death, as a serpent, flees, at whom demons
   tremble, and the sea is in alarm; for whom the heavens are rent and all
   the powers are shaken. For behold when He says, Why hast Thou forsaken
   Me?' the Father shewed that He was ever and even then in Him; for the
   earth knowing its Lord [3189] who spoke, straightway trembled, and the
   vail was rent, and the sun was hidden, and the rocks were torn asunder,
   and the graves, as I have said, did gape, and the dead in them arose;
   and, what is wonderful, they who were then present and had before
   denied Him, then seeing these signs, confessed that truly He was the
   Son of God [3190] .'

   57. And as to His saying, If it be possible, let the cup pass,' observe
   how, though He thus spake, He rebuked [3191] Peter, saying, Thou
   savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.' For
   He willed [3192] what He deprecated, for therefore had He come; but His
   was the willing (for for it He came), but the terror belonged to the
   flesh. Wherefore as man He utters this speech also, and yet both were
   said by the Same, to shew that He was God, willing in Himself, but when
   He had become man, having a flesh that was in terror. For the sake of
   this flesh He combined His own will with human weakness [3193] , that
   destroying this affection He might in turn make man undaunted in face
   of death. Behold then a thing strange indeed! He to whom Christ's
   enemies impute words of terror, He by that so-called [3194] tenor
   renders men undaunted and fearless. And so the Blessed Apostles after
   Him from such words of His conceived so great a contempt of death, as
   not even to care for those who questioned them, but to answer, We ought
   to obey God rather than men [3195] .' And the other Holy Martyrs were
   so bold, as to think that they were rather passing to life than
   undergoing death. Is it not extravagant then, to admire the courage of
   the servants of the Word, yet to say that the Word Himself was in
   terror, through whom they despised death? But from that most enduring
   purpose and courage of the Holy Martyrs is shewn, that the Godhead was
   not in terror, but the Saviour took away our terror. For as He
   abolished death by death, and by human means all human evils, so by
   this so-called terror did He remove our terror, and brought about that
   never more should men fear death. His word and deed go together. For
   human were the sayings, Let the cup pass,' and Why hast Thou forsaken
   Me?' and divine the act whereby the Same did cause the sun to fail and
   the dead to rise. Again He said humanly, Now is My soul troubled;' and
   He said divinely, I have power to lay down My life, and power to take
   it again [3196] .' For to be troubled was proper to the flesh, and to
   have power to lay down His life [3197] and take it again, when He will,
   was no property of men but of the Word's power. For man dies, not by
   his own power, but by necessity of nature and against his will; but the
   Lord, being Himself immortal, but having a mortal flesh, had power, as
   God, to become separate from the body and to take it again, when He
   would. Concerning this too speaks David in the Psalm, Thou shalt not
   leave My soul in hades, neither shalt Thou suffer Thy Holy One to see
   corruption [3198] .' For it beseemed that the flesh, corruptible as it
   was, should no longer after its own nature remain mortal, but because
   of the Word who had put it on, should abide incorruptible. For as He,
   having come in our body, was conformed to our condition, so we,
   receiving Him, partake of the immortality that is from Him.

   58. Idle then is the excuse for stumbling, and petty the notions
   concerning the Word, of these Ario-maniacs, because it is written, He
   was troubled,' and He wept.' For they seem not even to have human
   feeling, if they are thus ignorant of man's nature and properties;
   which do but make it the greater wonder, that the Word should be in
   such a suffering flesh, and neither prevented those who were conspiring
   against Him, nor took vengeance of those who were putting Him to death,
   though He was able, He who hindered some from dying, and raised others
   from the dead. And He let His own body suffer, for therefore did He
   come, as I said before, that in the flesh He might suffer, and
   thenceforth the flesh might be made impassible and immortal [3199] ,
   and that, as we have many times said, contumely and other troubles
   might determine upon Him and come short of others after Him, being by
   Him annulled utterly; and that henceforth men might for ever abide
   [3200] incorruptible, as a temple of the Word [3201] . Had Christ's
   enemies thus dwelt on these thoughts, and recognised the ecclesiastical
   scope as an anchor for the faith, they would not have made shipwreck of
   the faith, nor been so shameless as to resist those who would fain
   recover them from their fall, and to deem those as enemies who are
   admonishing them to be religious [3202] .

   [3193] It is observable that, as elsewhere we have seen Athan. speak of
   the nature of the Word, and of, not the nature of man as united to Him,
   but of flesh, humanity, &c. (vid. Or. ii. 45, n. 2.) so here, instead
   of speaking of two wills, he speaks of the Word's willing and human
   weakness, terror, &c. In another place he says still more pointedly,
   The will was of the Godhead alone; since the whole nature of the Word
   was manifested in the second Adam's human form and visible flesh.'

   adv. Apol. 32. vid. also 31. An obvious objection may be drawn from
   such passages, as if the will of the flesh' were represented as
   contrary (vid. foregoing note) to the will of the Word. The whole of
   our Lord's prayer is offered by Him as man, because it is a prayer; the
   first part is not from Him as man, but the second, which corrects it,
   from Him as God [i.e. the first part is not human as contrasted with
   the second]; but the former part is from the sinless infirmity of our
   nature, the latter from His human will expressing its acquiescence in
   His Father's, that is, in His Divine Will. His Will,' says S. Greg.
   Naz. was not contrary to God, being all deified, theothen holon.'

   are taken to imply that His death was His free act. vid. Ambros. in
   loc. Luc. Hieron. in loc. Matt. also Athan. Serm. Maj. de Fid. 4. It is
   Catholic doctrine that our Lord, as man, submitted to death of His free
   will, and not as obeying an express command of the Father. Cf. S.

   tell us, that Scripture did not so force its meaning on the individual
   as to dispense with an interpreter, and as if his own deductions were
   not to be viewed merely in their own logical power, great as that power
   often is, but as under the authority of the Catholic doctrines which
   they subserve. Vid. Or. iii. 18, n. 3.

   Chapter XXX.--Objections continued, as in Chapters vii.--x. Whether the
   Son is begotten of the Father's will? This virtually the same as
   whether once He was not? and used by the Arians to introduce the latter
   question. The Regula Fidei answers it at once in the negative by
   contrary texts. The Arians follow the Valentinians in maintaining a
   precedent will; which really is only exercised by God towards
   creatures. Instances from Scripture. Inconsistency of Asterius. If the
   Son by will, there must be another Word before Him. If God is good, or
   exist, by His will, then is the Son by His will. If He willed to have
   reason or wisdom, then is His Word and Wisdom at His will. The Son is
   the Living Will, and has all titles which denote connaturality. That
   will which the Father has to the Son, the Son has to the Father. The
   Father wills the Son and the Son wills the Father.

   58. (continued). But [3203] , as it seems, a heretic is a wicked thing
   in truth, and in every respect his heart is depraved [3204] and
   irreligious. For behold, though convicted on all points, and shewn to
   be utterly bereft of understanding, they feel no shame; but as the
   hydra of Gentile fable, when its former serpents were destroyed, gave
   birth to fresh ones, contending against the slayer of the old by the
   production of new, so also they, hostile [3205] and hateful to God
   [3206] , as hydras [3207] , losing their life in the objections which
   they advance, invent for themselves other questions Judaic and foolish,
   and new expedients, as if Truth were their enemy, thereby to shew the
   rather that they are Christ's opponents in all things.

   59. After so many proofs against them, at which even the devil who is
   their father [3208] had himself been abashed and gone back, again as
   from their perverse heart they mutter forth other expedients, sometimes
   in whispers, sometimes with the drone [3209] of gnats; Be it so,' say
   they; interpret these places thus, and gain the victory in reasonings
   and proofs; still you must say that the Son has received being from the
   Father at His will and pleasure;' for thus they deceive many, putting
   forward the will and the pleasure of God. Now if any of those who
   believe aright [3210] were to say this in simplicity, there would be no
   cause to be suspicious of the expression, the right intention [3211]
   prevailing over that somewhat simple use of words [3212] . But since
   the phrase is from the heretics [3213] and the words of heretics are
   suspicious, and, as it is written, The wicked are deceitful,' and The
   words of the wicked are deceit [3214] ,' even though they but make
   signs [3215] , for their heart is depraved, come let us examine this
   phrase also, lest, though convicted on all sides, still, as hydras,
   they invent a fresh word, and by such clever language and specious
   evasion, they sow again that irreligion of theirs in another way. For
   he who says, The Son came to be at the Divine will,' has the same
   meaning as another who says, Once He was not,' and The Son came to be
   out of nothing,' and He is a creature.' But since they are now ashamed
   of these phrases, these crafty ones have endeavoured to convey their
   meaning in another way, putting forth the word will,' as cuttlefish
   their blackness, thereby to blind the simple [3216] , and to keep in
   mind their peculiar heresy. For whence [3217] bring they by will and
   pleasure?' or from what Scripture? let them say, who are so suspicious
   in their words and so inventive of irreligion. For the Father who
   revealed from heaven His own Word, declared, This is My beloved Son;'
   and by David He said, My heart uttered a good Word;' and John He bade
   say, In the beginning was the Word;' and David says in the Psalm, With
   Thee is the well of life, and in Thy light shall we see light;' and the
   Apostle writes, Who being the Radiance of Glory,' and again, Who being
   in the form of God,' and, Who is the Image of the invisible God [3218]
   .'

   60. All everywhere tell us of the being of the Word, but none of His
   being by will,' nor at all of His making; but they, where, I ask, did
   they find will or pleasure precedent [3219] ' to the Word of God,
   unless forsooth, leaving the Scriptures, they simulate the perverseness
   of Valentinus? For Ptolemy the Valentinian said that the Unoriginate
   had a pair of attributes, Thought and Will, and first He thought and
   then He willed; and what He thought, He could not put forth [3220] ,
   unless when the power of the Will was added. Thence the Arians taking a
   lesson, wish will and pleasure to precede the Word. For them then, let
   them rival the doctrine of Valentinus; but we, when we read the divine
   discourses, found He was' applied to the Son, but of Him only did we
   hear as being in the Father and the Father's Image; while in the case
   of things originate only, since also by nature these things once were
   not, but afterwards came to be [3221] , did we recognise a precedent
   will and pleasure, David saying in the hundred and thirteenth Psalm, As
   for our God He is in heaven, He hath done whatsoever pleased Him,' and
   in the hundred and tenth, The works of the Lord are great, sought out
   unto all His good pleasure;' and again, in the hundred and
   thirty-fourth, Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did He in heaven, and
   in earth, and in the sea, and in all deep places [3222] .' If then He
   be work and thing made, and one among others, let Him, as others, be
   said by will' to have come to be, and Scripture shews that these are
   thus brought into being. And Asterius, the advocate [3223] for the
   heresy, acquiesces, when he thus writes, For if it be unworthy of the
   Framer of all, to make at pleasure, let His being pleased be removed
   equally in the case of all, that His Majesty be preserved unimpaired.
   Or if it be befitting God to will, then let this better way obtain in
   the case of the first Offspring. For it is not possible that it should
   be fitting for one and the same God to make things at His pleasure, and
   not at His will also.' In spite of the Sophist having introduced
   abundant irreligion in his words, namely, that the Offspring and the
   thing made are the same, and that the Son is one offspring out of all
   offsprings that are, He ends with the conclusion that it is fitting to
   say that the works are by will and pleasure.

   61. Therefore if He be other than all things, as has been above shewn
   [3224] , and through Him the works rather came to be, let not by will'
   be applied to Him, or He has similarly come to be as the things consist
   which through Him come to be. For Paul, whereas he was not before,
   became afterwards an Apostle by the will of God [3225] ;' and our own
   calling, as itself once not being, but now taking place afterwards, is
   preceded by will, and, as Paul himself says again, has been made
   according to the good pleasure of His will [3226] .' And what Moses
   relates, Let there be light,' and Let the earth appear,' and Let Us
   make man,' is, I think, according to what has gone before [3227] ,
   significant of the will of the Agent. For things which once were not
   but happened afterwards from external causes, these the Framer counsels
   to make; but His own Word begotten from Him by nature, concerning Him
   He did not counsel beforehand; for in Him the Father makes, in Him
   frames, other things whatever He counsels; as also James the Apostle
   teaches, saying, Of His own will begat He us with the Word of truth
   [3228] .' Therefore the Will of God concerning all things, whether they
   be begotten again or are brought into being at the first, is in His
   Word, in whom He both makes and begets again what seems right to Him;
   as the Apostle [3229] again signifies, writing to Thessalonica; for
   this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.' But if, in
   whom He makes, in Him also is the will, and in Christ is the pleasure
   of the Father, how can He, as others, come into being by will and
   pleasure? For if He too came to be as you maintain, by will, it follows
   that the will concerning Him consists in some other Word, through whom
   He in turn comes to be; for it has been shewn that God's will is not in
   the things which He brings into being, but in Him through whom and in
   whom all things made are brought to be. Next, since it is all one to
   say By will' and Once He was not,' let them make up their minds to say,
   Once He was not,' that, perceiving with shame that times are signified
   by the latter, they may understand that to say by will' is to place
   times before the Son; for counselling goes before things which once
   were not, as in the case of all creatures. But if the Word is the
   Framer of the creatures, and He coexists with the Father, how can to
   counsel precede the Everlasting as if He were not? for if counsel
   precedes, how through Him are all things? For rather He too, as one
   among others is by will begotten to be a Son, as we too were made sons
   by the Word of Truth; and it rests, as was said, to seek another Word,
   through whom He too has come to be, and was begotten together with all
   things, which were according to God's pleasure.

   62. If then there is another Word of God, then be the Son originated by
   a word; but if there be not, as is the case, but all things by Him have
   come to be, which the Father has willed, does not this expose the
   many-headed [3230] craftiness of these men? that feeling shame at
   saying work,' and creature,' and God's Word was not before His
   generation,' yet in another way they assert that He is a creature,
   putting forward will,' and saying, Unless He has by will come to be,
   therefore God had a Son by necessity and against His good pleasure.'
   And who is it then who imposes necessity on Him, O men most wicked, who
   draw everything to the purpose of your heresy? for what is contrary to
   will they see; but what is greater and transcends it has escaped their
   perception. For as what is beside purpose is contrary to will, so what
   is according to nature transcends and precedes counselling [3231] . A
   man by counsel builds a house, but by nature he begets a son; and what
   is in building began to come into being at will, and is external to the
   maker; but the son is proper offspring of the father's essence, and is
   not external to him; wherefore neither does he counsel concerning him,
   lest he appear to counsel about himself. As far then as the Son
   transcends the creature, by so much does what is by nature transcend
   the will [3232] . And they, on hearing of Him, ought not to measure by
   will what is by nature; forgetting however that they are hearing about
   God's Son, they dare to apply human contrarieties in the instance of
   God, necessity' and beside purpose,' to be able thereby to deny that
   there is a true Son of God. For let them tell us themselves,--that God
   is good and merciful, does this attach to Him by will or not? if by
   will, we must consider that He began to be good, and that His not being
   good is possible; for to counsel and choose implies an inclination two
   ways, and is incidental to a rational nature. But if it be too unseemly
   that He should be called good and merciful upon will, then what they
   have said themselves must be retorted on them,--therefore by necessity
   and not at His pleasure He is good;' and, who is it that imposes this
   necessity on Him?' But if it be unseemly to speak of necessity in the
   case of God, and therefore it is by nature that He is good, much more
   is He, and more truly, Father of the Son by nature and not by will.

   63. Moreover let them answer us this:--(for against their shamelessness
   I wish to urge a further question, bold indeed, but with a religious
   intent; be propitious, O Lord [3233] !)--the Father Himself, does He
   exist, first having counselled, then being pleased, or before
   counselling? For since they are so bold in the instance of the Word,
   they must receive the like answer, that they may know that this their
   presumption reaches even to the Father Himself. If then they shall
   themselves take counsel about will, and say that even He is from will,
   what then was He before He counselled, or what gained He, as ye
   consider, after counselling? But if such a question be unseemly and
   self-destructive, and shocking even to ask (for it is enough only to
   hear God's Name for us to know and understand that He is He that Is),
   will it not also be against reason to have parallel thoughts concerning
   the Word of God, and to make pretences of will and pleasure? for it is
   enough in like manner only to hear the Name of the Word, to know and
   understand that He who is God not by will, has not by will but by
   nature His own Word. And does it not surpass all conceivable madness,
   to entertain the thought only, that God Himself counsels and considers
   and chooses and proceeds to have a good pleasure, that He be not
   without Word and without Wisdom, but have both? for He seems to be
   considering about Himself, who counsels about what is proper to His
   Essence. There being then much blasphemy in such a thought, it will be
   religious to say that things originate have come to be by favour and
   will,' but the Son is not a work of will, nor has come after [3234] ,
   as the creation, but is by nature the own Offspring of God's Essence.
   For being the own Word of the Father, He allows us not to account
   [3235] of will as before Himself, since He is Himself the Father's
   Living Counsel [3236] , and Power, and Framer of the things which
   seemed good to the Father. And this is what He says of Himself in the
   Proverbs; Counsel is mine and security, mine is understanding, and mine
   strength [3237] .' For as, although Himself the Understanding,' in
   which He prepared the heavens, and Himself Strength and Power' (for
   Christ is God's Power and God's Wisdom' [3238] ), He here has altered
   the terms and said, Mine is understanding' and Mine strength,' so while
   He says, Mine is counsel,' He must Himself be the Living [3239] Counsel
   of the Father; as we have learned from the Prophet also, that He
   becomes the Angel of great Counsel [3240] ,' and was called the good
   pleasure of the Father; for thus we must refute them, using human
   illustrations [3241] concerning God.

   64. Therefore if the works subsist by will and favour,' and the whole
   creature is made at God's good pleasure,' and Paul was called to be an
   Apostle by the will of God,' and our calling has come about by His good
   pleasure and will,' and all things have come into being through the
   Word, He is external to the things which have come to be by will, but
   rather is Himself the Living Counsel of the Father, by which all these
   things have come to be; by which David also gives thanks in the
   seventy-second Psalm. Thou hast holden me by my right hand; Thou shalt
   guide me with Thy Counsel [3242] .' How then can the Word, being the
   Counsel and Good Pleasure of the Father, come into being Himself by
   good pleasure and will,' like every one else? unless, as I said before,
   in their madness they repeat that He has come into being through
   Himself, or through some other [3243] . Who then is it through whom He
   has come to be? let them fashion another Word; and let them name
   another Christ, rivalling the doctrine of Valentinus [3244] ; for
   Scripture it is not. And though they fashion another, yet assuredly he
   too comes into being through some one; and so, while we are thus
   reckoning up and investigating the succession of them, the many-headed
   [3245] heresy of the Atheists [3246] is discovered to issue in
   polytheism [3247] and madness unlimited; in the which, wishing the Son
   to be a creature and from nothing, they imply the same thing in other
   words by pretending the words will and pleasure, which rightly belong
   to things originate and creatures. Is it not irreligious then to impute
   the characteristics of things originate to the Framer of all? and is it
   not blasphemous to say that will was in the Father before the Word? for
   if will precedes in the Father, the Son's words are not true, I in the
   Father;' or even if He is in the Father, yet He will hold but a second
   place, and it became Him not to say I in the Father,' since will was
   before Him, in which all things were brought into being and He Himself
   subsisted, as you hold. For though He excel in glory, He is not the
   less one of the things which by will come into being. And, as we have
   said before, if it be so, how is He Lord and they servants [3248] ? but
   He is Lord of all, because He is one with the Father's Lordship; and
   the creation is all in bondage, since it is external to the Oneness of
   the Father, and, whereas it once was not, was brought to be.

   65. Moreover, if they say that the Son is by will, they should say also
   that He came to be by understanding; for I consider understanding and
   will to be the same. For what a man counsels, about that also he has
   understanding; and what he has in understanding, that also he counsels.
   Certainly the Saviour Himself has made them correspond, as being
   cognate, when He says, Counsel is mine and security; mine is
   understanding, and mine strength [3249] .' For as strength and security
   are the same (for they mean one attribute), so we may say that
   Understanding and Counsel are the same, which is the Lord. But these
   irreligious men are unwilling that the Son should be Word and Living
   Counsel; but they fable that there is with God [3250] , as if a habit
   [3251] , coming and going [3252] , after the manner of men,
   understanding, counsel, wisdom; and they leave nothing undone, and they
   put forward the Thought' and Will' of Valentinus, so that they may but
   separate the Son from the Father, and may call Him a creature instead
   of the proper Word of the Father. To them then must be said what was
   said to Simon Magus; the irreligion of Valentinus perish with you
   [3253] ;' and let every one rather trust to Solomon, who says, that the
   Word is Wisdom and Understanding. For he says, The Lord by Wisdom
   founded the earth, by Understanding He established the heavens.' And as
   here by Understanding, so in the Psalms, By the Word of the Lord were
   the heavens made.' And as by the Word the heavens, so He hath done
   whatsoever pleased Him.' And as the Apostle writes to Thessalonians,
   the will of God is in Christ Jesus [3254] .' The Son of God then, He is
   the Word' and the Wisdom;' He the Understanding' and the Living
   Counsel;' and in Him is the Good Pleasure of the Father;' He is Truth'
   and Light' and Power' of the Father. But if the Will of God is Wisdom
   and Understanding, and the Son is Wisdom, he who says that the Son is
   by will,' says virtually that Wisdom has come into being in wisdom, and
   the Son is made in a son, and the Word created through the Word [3255]
   ; which is incompatible with God and is opposed to His Scriptures. For
   the Apostle proclaims the Son to be the own Radiance and Expression,
   not of the Father's will [3256] , but of His Essence [3257] Itself,
   saying, Who being the Radiance of His glory and the Expression of His
   Subsistence [3258] .' But if, as we have said before, the Father's
   Essence and Subsistence be not from will, neither, as is very plain, is
   what is proper to the Father's Subsistence from will; for such as, and
   so as, that Blessed Subsistence, must also be the proper Offspring from
   It. And accordingly the Father Himself said not, This is the Son
   originated at My will,' nor the Son whom I have by My favour,' but
   simply My Son,' and more than that, in whom I am well pleased;' meaning
   by this, This is the Son by nature; and in Him is lodged My will about
   what pleases Me.'

   66. Since then the Son is by nature and not by will, is He without the
   pleasure of the Father and not with the Father's will? No, verily; but
   the Son is with the pleasure of the Father, and, as He says Himself,
   The Father loveth the Son, and sheweth Him all things [3259] .' For as
   not from will' did He begin to be good, nor yet is good without will
   and pleasure (for what He is, that also is His pleasure), so also that
   the Son should be, though it came not from will,' yet it is not without
   His pleasure or against His purpose. For as His own Subsistence is by
   His pleasure, so also the Son, being proper to His Essence, is not
   without His pleasure. Be then the Son the object of the Father's
   pleasure and love; and thus let every one religiously account of [3260]
   the pleasure and the not-unwillingness of God. For by that good
   pleasure wherewith the Son is the object of the Father's pleasure, is
   the Father the object of the Son's love, pleasure, and honour; and one
   is the good pleasure which is from Father in Son, so that here too we
   may contemplate the Son in the Father and the Father in the Son. Let no
   one then, with Valentinus, introduce a precedent will; nor let any one,
   by this pretence of counsel,' intrude between the Only Father and the
   Only Word; for it were madness to place will and consideration between
   them. For it is one thing to say, Of will He came to be,' and another,
   that the Father has love and good pleasure towards His Son who is His
   own by nature. For to say, Of will He came to be,' in the first place
   implies that once He was not; and next it implies an inclination two
   ways, as has been said, so that one might suppose that the Father could
   even not will the Son. But to say of the Son, He might not have been,'
   is an irreligious presumption reaching even to the Essence of the
   Father, as if what is His own might not have been. For it is the same
   as saying, The Father might not have been good.' And as the Father is
   always good by nature, so He is always generative [3261] by nature; and
   to say, The Father's good pleasure is the Son,' and The Word's good
   pleasure is the Father,' implies, not a precedent will, but genuineness
   of nature, and propriety and likeness of Essence. For as in the case of
   the radiance and light one might say, that there is no will preceding
   radiance in the light, but it is its natural offspring, at the pleasure
   of the light which begat it, not by will and consideration, but in
   nature and truth, so also in the instance of the Father and the Son,
   one might rightly say, that the Father has love and good pleasure
   towards the Son, and the Son has love and good pleasure towards the
   Father.

   67. Therefore call not the Son a work of good pleasure; nor bring in
   the doctrine of Valentinus into the Church; but be He the Living
   Counsel, and Offspring in truth and nature, as the Radiance from the
   Light. For thus has the Father spoken, My heart uttered a good Word;'
   and the Son conformably, I in the Father and the Father in Me [3262] .'
   But if the Word be in the heart, where is will? and if the Son in the
   Father, where is good pleasure? and if He be Will Himself, how is
   counsel in Will? it is unseemly; lest the Word come into being in a
   word, and the Son in a son, and Wisdom in a wisdom, as has been
   repeatedly [3263] said. For the Son is the Father's All; and nothing
   was in the Father before the Word; but in the Word is will also, and
   through Him the objects of will are carried into effect, as holy
   Scriptures have shewn. And I could wish that the irreligious men,
   having fallen into such want of reason [3264] as to be considering
   about will, would now ask their childbearing women no more, whom they
   used to ask, Hadst thou a son before conceiving him [3265] ?' but the
   father, Do ye become fathers by counsel, or by the natural law of your
   will?' or Are your children like your nature and essence [3266] ?'
   that, even from fathers they may learn shame, from whom they assumed
   this proposition [3267] about birth, and from whom they hoped to gain
   knowledge in point. For they will reply to them, What we beget, is
   like, not our good pleasure [3268] , but like ourselves; nor become we
   parents by previous counsel, but to beget is proper to our nature;
   since we too are images of our fathers.' Either then let them condemn
   themselves [3269] , and cease asking women about the Son of God, or let
   them learn from them, that the Son is begotten not by will, but in
   nature and truth. Becoming and suitable to them is a refutation from
   human instances [3270] , since the perverse-minded men dispute in a
   human way concerning the Godhead. Why then are Christ's enemies still
   mad? for this, as well as their other pretences, is shewn and proved to
   be mere fantasy and fable; and on this account, they ought, however
   late, contemplating the precipice of folly down which they have fallen,
   to rise again from the depth and to flee the snare of the devil, as we
   admonish them. For Truth is loving unto men and cries continually, If
   because of My clothing of the body ye believe Me not, yet believe the
   works, that ye may know that "I am in the Father and the Father in Me,"
   and "I and the Father are one," and "He that hath seen Me hath seen the
   Father [3271] ."' But the Lord according to His wont is loving to man,
   and would fain help them that are fallen,' as the praise of David
   [3272] says; but the irreligious men, not desirous to hear the Lord's
   voice, nor bearing to see Him acknowledged by all as God and God's Son,
   go about, miserable men, as beetles, seeking with their father the
   devil pretexts for irreligion. What pretexts then, and whence will they
   be able next to find? unless they borrow blasphemies of Jews and
   Caiaphas, and take atheism from Gentiles? for the divine Scriptures are
   closed to them, and from every part of them they are refuted as
   insensate and Christ's enemies.

   [3231] Thus he makes the question a nugatory one, as if it did not go
   to the point, and could not be answered, or might be answered either
   way, as the case might be. Really Nature and Will go together in the
   Divine Being, but in order, as we regard Him, Nature is first, Will
   second, and the generation belongs to Nature, not to Will. And so supr.

   [3232] Two distinct meanings may be attached to by will' (as Dr. Clark
   observes, Script. Doct. p. 142. ed. 1738), either a concurrence or
   acquiescence, or a positive act. S. Cyril uses it in the former sense,
   when he calls it sundromos, as quoted Â§60, n. 1; and when he says (with
   Athan. infr.) that the Father wills His own subsistence, theleges esti,
   but is not what He is from any will, ek bouleseos tinos,' Thes. p. 56;
   Dr. Clark would understand it in the latter sense, with a view of
   inferring that the Son was subsequent to a Divine act, i.e. not
   eternal; but what Athan. says leads to the conclusion, that it does not
   matter which sense is taken. He does not meet the Arian objection, if
   not by will therefore by necessity,' by speaking of a concomitant will,
   or merely saying that the Almighty exists or is good, by will, with S.
   Cyril, but he says that nature transcends will and necessity also.'
   Accordingly, Petavius is even willing to allow that the ek boules is to
   be ascribed to the gennesis in the sense which Dr. Clark wishes, i.e.
   he grants that it may precede the gennesis, i.e. in order, not in time,
   in the succession of our ideas, Trin. vi. 8, Â§Â§20, 21; and follows S.
   Austin, Trin. xv. 20. in preferring to speak of our Lord rather as
   voluntas de voluntate, than, as Athan. is led to do, as the voluntas
   Dei.

   Excursus C.

   Introductory [3273] to the Fourth Discourse against the Arians.

   ------------------------

   The fourth Discourse, as has been already observed (p. 304), stands on
   a footing of its own. To begin with, it is not quoted in antiquity, as
   the first three are, as part of the work of Ath. against the Arians
   (details in Newman, p. 499). Again, the fact that not only the Ep. Ã†g.,
   but even the dubious de Incar. c. Arian., are in some mss. included in
   the Orationes, while our present oration appears sometimes as the
   fifth' sometimes as the sixth,' cast a shade of doubt upon its claim to
   be included in the Pentabiblus against the Arians' referred to by
   Photius. In addition to these external considerations, Newman lays
   stress on the apparent want of continuity in its argument; on its
   non-conformity to the structural plan of Orat. i.-iii., on the use of
   the term homoousion (Â§Â§10, 22, contrast Orat. i. Â§9, p. 311, note 12);
   on certain peculiarities of style which seem characteristic of
   disjointed notes rather than of a systematic treatise; on the reference
   to Eusebius' (of CÃ¦sarea) as apparently still living (Â§8); and on the
   general absence of personal reference to opponents, while yet a
   definite and extant system seems to be combated.

   Now a comparison with the works of Eusebius against Marcellus leaves
   little doubt that the system combated by Athan. is that of the latter
   (described briefly Prolegg. ch. ii. Â§3 (2) c).

   After laying down as a thesis (Â§1) the substantive existence of the
   divine Word or Wisdom, Athan. proceeds to combat the idea that the Word
   has no personality distinct from that of the Father. Setting aside the
   alternative errors of Sabellius (Â§2) and Arius (Â§3), he taxes with the
   consequence of involving two 'Archai a view that the Word had a
   substantive existence and was then united to the Father (cf. Euseb. c.
   Marcell. 32 A, 108 A, 106 C, D). This consequence can only be avoided
   by falling into the Sabellian alternative of a theos diphues (cf.
   Tertullian's Deum versipellem'), unless the true solution, that of the
   eternal divine gennesis, be accepted (Â§3 worked out in 4, 5). The
   argument, apparently interrupted by an anti-Arian digression Â§Â§6, 7, is
   resumed Â§8, whence it proceeds without break to Â§24. Eusebius,
   insisting against Marcellus on the eternity of Christ's Kingdom,
   inconsistently defends those who deny the eternity of His Person. But
   if so, how inconsistent are those who deny the Son any pre-existence,
   while yet repelling the Arian formulÃ¦ with indignation! In Â§Â§9-12,
   taking Joh. x. 30 as his text, Athan. asks his opponents in what sense
   Christ and the Father are one,' distinguishing from his own answer that
   of Sabellius (9, 10), and that of Marcellus (11, 12), whom he presses
   with the paradoxical character of his explanation of the divine
   gennesis. In Â§Â§13, 14, he examines the (Marcellian, not Sabellian)
   doctrine of platusmos and sustole, charging it with Sabellianism as its
   consequence. Next (Â§Â§15-24) Ath. turns upon the radically weak point of
   the system of Marcellus (Prolegg. ubi supra), and asks What do his
   followers mean by the Son?' Do they mean merely (a) the man, Christ
   (Â§20, Photinus), or (b) the union of Word and Man, or (c) the Word
   regarded as Incarnate? The latter was the answer (Â§22) of Marcellus
   himself. This last point leads to a discussion (Â§24) of those O.T.
   passages on which Marcellus notoriously relied. Â§25, which Zahn
   understands as a direct polemic against Sabellius, is far more
   probably, as Newman maintains in his note, a supplemental argument
   against Marcellianism, for the view combated is said to lead inevitably
   to Sabellianism. The concluding portion, Â§Â§26-36, turns the argument of
   Â§24, that Scripture declares the identity of Son and Word, against
   those who (adopting alternative (a) supra) drift from Marcellianism
   toward the Samosatene rather than toward the Sabellian position (on the
   connection of the two see Prolegg. ch. ii. Â§3 (2) a and c). Even here,
   the name of Photinus, to whose position the section specially applies,
   is significantly withheld.

   Such is the course of the argument in the Fourth Oration; and with the
   exception of Â§Â§6, 7, and again possibly Â§25, it forms a homogeneous, if
   not a finished and elaborated piece of argument. Its date and
   composition may be left an open question; but its purpose as an
   appendix to Orat. i.-iii., is we think open to little doubt (supr. p.
   304). Of Sabellius, who left no writings [3274] , the age of Athanasius
   knew little, except that he identified Father and Son (huiopator), and
   denied the Trinity of Persons. Most that is told us of Sabellius from
   the fourth century onwards requires careful sifting, in order to
   eliminate what really belongs to Marcellus, Photinus, or others who
   were taxed with Sabellianism, and combated as Sabellians.' But with the
   simple patri-passianism which is the one undoubted element in the
   teaching of Sabellius, Marcellus had little or nothing in common. The
   criticism of Marcellus that Sabellius knew not the Word' reveals the
   true difference between them. To Sabellius, creation and redemption
   were the work of the one God under successive changes of manifestation;
   to Marcellus, they were the realisation of a process eternally latent
   in God; but both Marcellus and apparently Sabellius referred to the
   divine Nature what the theology of the Church has consistently referred
   to the divine Will.

   The following table will make the foregoing scheme clear.

   Â§1. Introductory. Thesis: the co-eternal personality of the Son or
   Word.

   Â§Â§2-5. Those who, while rejecting Arianism, would avoid Sabellianism,
   must accept the eternal divine Generation of the Son.

   Â§Â§6, 7. [Digression: the humiliation of the Word explained against the
   Arians.]

   Â§8. The eternity of Christ's Kingdom and of His Person implied each in
   the other.

   Â§Â§9-12. In what sense Christ and the Father are, and are not, one. The
   divine gennesis.

   Â§Â§13, 14. The doctrine of divine dilatation and contraction denies true
   personal distinctions in the Godhead.

   Â§Â§15-24. The Son and the Word identical. Refutation of the three
   alternative suppositions, and of the argument alleged from the O.T. in
   support of them.

   Â§25. Final refutation of the doctrine of dilatation.

   Â§Â§26-36. The Scriptural identification of Son and Word refutes the
   restriction of the former title to the man Jesus.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [3273] The above Excursus is substituted for the longer introduction of
   Newman (republished in Latin in his Tracts, Theological and
   Ecclesiastical, 1872), and is in the main a condensation of the more
   recent and final discussion of Zahn (Marcellus, 1867, pp. 198 seqq.).
   The result of the latter is to confirm the main contention of Newman,
   viz. that the system, rather than the person, of Marcellus is
   throughout in view. Earlier discussions pointing the same way are
   cited: In Eusebii contra Marcellum libros Observationes, auctore
   K.S.C.,' Lips. 1787 (cited by Newman); Rettberg, Marcelliana, PrÃ¦f. p.
   7; Kuhn, Kathol. Dogm. ii. p. 344, note 1 (by Zahn).

   [3274] The Articles Sabellianism and Sabellius (both sub. fin.) in
   D.C.B. vol. iv., state the contrary, but the present writer follows the
   standard discussion of Zahn, of which the learned articles in question
   do not seem to take account.

   Discourse IV.

   ------------------------

   Â§Â§1-5. The substantiality of the Word proved from Scripture. If the One
   Origin be substantial, Its Word is substantial. Unless the Word and Son
   be a second Origin, or a work, or an attribute (and so God be
   compounded), or at the same time Father, or involve a second nature in
   God, He is from the Father's Essence and distinct from Him.
   Illustration of John x. 30, drawn from Deut. iv. 4.

   1. The Word is God from God; for the Word was God [3275] ,' and again,
   Of whom are the Fathers, and of whom Christ, who is God over all,
   blessed for ever. Amen [3276] .' And since Christ is God from God, and
   God's Word, Wisdom, Son, and Power, therefore but One God is declared
   in the divine Scriptures. For the Word, being Son of the One God, is
   referred to Him of whom also He is; so that Father and Son are two, yet
   the Monad of the Godhead is indivisible and inseparable. And thus too
   we preserve One Beginning of Godhead and not two Beginnings, whence
   there is strictly a Monarchy. And of this very Beginning the Word is by
   nature Son, not as if another beginning, subsisting by Himself, nor
   having come into being externally to that Beginning, lest from that
   diversity a Dyarchy and Polyarchy should ensue; but of the one
   Beginning He is own Son, own Wisdom, own Word, existing from It. For,
   according to John, in' that Beginning was the Word, and the Word was
   with God,' for the Beginning was God; and since He is from It,
   therefore also the Word was God.' And as there is one Beginning and
   therefore one God, so one is that Essence and Subsistence which indeed
   and truly and really is, and which said I am that I am [3277] ,' and
   not two, that there be not two Beginnings; and from the One, a Son in
   nature and truth, is Its own Word, Its Wisdom, Its Power, and
   inseparable from It. And as there is not another essence, lest there be
   two Beginnings, so the Word which is from that One Essence has no
   dissolution, nor is a sound significative, but is an essential Word and
   essential Wisdom, which is the true Son. For were He not essential, God
   will be speaking into the air [3278] , and having a body, in nothing
   differently from men; but since He is not man, neither is His Word
   according to the infirmity of man [3279] . For as the Beginning is one
   Essence, so Its Word is one, essential, and subsisting, and Its Wisdom.
   For as He is God from God, and Wisdom from the Wise, and Word from the
   Rational, and Son from Father, so is He from Subsistence Subsistent,
   and from Essence Essential and Substantive, and Being from Being.

   2. Since were He not essential Wisdom and substantive Word, and Son
   existing, but simply Wisdom and Word and Son in the Father, then the
   Father Himself would have a nature compounded of Wisdom and Word. But
   if so, the forementioned absurdities would follow; and He will be His
   own Father, and the Son begetting and begotten by Himself; or Word,
   Wisdom, Son, is a name only, and He does not subsist who owns, or
   rather who is, these titles. If then He does not subsist, the names are
   idle and empty, unless we say that God is Very Wisdom [3280] and Very
   Word. But if so, He is His own Father and Son; Father, when Wise, Son,
   when Wisdom; but these things are not in God as a certain quality; away
   with the dishonourable [3281] thought; for it will issue in this, that
   God is compounded of essence and quality [3282] . For whereas all
   quality is in essence, it will clearly follow that the Divine Monad,
   indivisible as it is, must be compound, being severed into essence and
   accident [3283] . We must ask then these headstrong men; The Son was
   proclaimed as God's Wisdom and Word; how then is He such? if as a
   quality, the absurdity has been shewn; but if God is that Very Wisdom,
   then it is the absurdity of Sabellius; therefore He is so, as an
   Offspring in a proper sense from the Father Himself, according to the
   illustration of light. For as there is light from fire, so from God is
   there a Word, and Wisdom from the Wise, and from the Father a Son. For
   in this way the Monad remains undivided and entire, and Its Son, Word
   not unessential, nor not subsisting, but essential truly. For were it
   not so, all that is said would be said notionally [3284] and verbally
   [3285] . But if we must avoid that absurdity, then is a true Word
   essential. For as there is a Father truly, so Wisdom truly. In this
   respect then they are two; not because, as Sabellius said, Father and
   Son are the same, but because the Father is Father and the Son Son, and
   they are one, because He is Son of the Essence of the Father by nature,
   existing as His own Word. This the Lord said, viz. I and the Father are
   One [3286] ;' for neither is the Word separated from the Father, nor
   was or is the Father ever Wordless; on this account He says, I in the
   Father and the Father in Me [3287] .'

   3. And again, Christ is the Word of God. Did He then subsist by
   Himself, and subsisting, has He become joined to the Father, or did God
   make Him or call Him His Word? If the former, I mean if He subsisted by
   Himself and is God, then there are two Beginnings; and moreover, as is
   plain, He is not the Father's own, as being not of the Father, but of
   Himself. But if on the contrary He be made externally, then is He a
   creature. It remains then to say that He is from God Himself; but if
   so, that which is from another is one thing, and that from which it is,
   is a second; according to this then there are two. But if they be not
   two, but the names belong to the same, cause and effect will be the
   same, and begotten and begetting, which has been shewn absurd in the
   instance of Sabellius. But if He be from Him, yet not another, He will
   be both begetting and not begetting; begetting because He produces from
   Himself, and not begetting, because it is nothing other than Himself.
   But if so, the same is called Father and Son notionally. But if it be
   unseemly so to say, Father and Son must be two; and they are one,
   because the Son is not from without, but begotten of God. But if any
   one shrinks from saying Offspring,' and only says that the Word exists
   with God, let such a one fear lest, shrinking from what is said in
   Scripture, he fall into absurdity, making God a being of double nature.
   For not granting that the Word is from the Monad, but simply as if He
   were joined to the Father, he introduces a twofold essence, and neither
   of them Father of the other. And the same of Power. And we may see this
   more clearly, if we consider it with reference to the Father; for there
   is One Father, and not two, but from that One the Son. As then there
   are not two Fathers, but One, so not two Beginnings, but One, and from
   that One the Son essential.

   4. But the Arians we must ask contrariwise: (for the Sabellianisers
   must be confuted from the notion of a Son, and the Arians from that of
   a Father:) let us say then--Is God wise and not word-less: or on the
   contrary, is He wisdom-less and word-less [3288] ? if the latter, there
   is an absurdity at once; if the former, we must ask, how is He wise and
   not word-less? does He possess the Word and the Wisdom from without, or
   from Himself? If from without, there must be one who first gave to Him,
   and before He received He was wisdom-less and word-less. But if from
   Himself, it is plain that the Word is not from nothing, nor once was
   not; for He was ever; since He of whom He is the Image, exists ever.
   But if they say that He is indeed wise and not word-less, but that He
   has in Himself His own wisdom and own word, and that, not Christ, but
   that by which He made Christ, we must answer that, if Christ in that
   word was brought to be, plainly so were all things; and it must be He
   of whom John says, All things were made by Him,' and the Psalmist, In
   Wisdom hast Thou made them all [3289] .' And Christ will be found to
   speak untruly, I in the Father,' there being another in the Father. And
   the Word became flesh [3290] ' is not true according to them. For if He
   in whom all things came to be,' Himself became flesh, but Christ is not
   in the Father, as Word by whom all things came to be,' then Christ has
   not become flesh, but perhaps Christ was named Word. But if so, first,
   there will be another besides the name, next, all things were not by
   Him brought to be, but in that other, in whom Christ also was made. But
   if they say that Wisdom is in the Father as a quality or that He is
   Very Wisdom [3291] , the absurdities will follow already mentioned. For
   He will be compound [3292] , and will prove His own Son and Father
   [3293] . Moreover, we must confute and silence them on the ground, that
   the Word which is in God cannot be a creature nor out of nothing; but
   if once a Word be in God, then He must be Christ who says, I am in the
   Father and the Father in Me [3294] ,' who also is therefore the
   Only-begotten, since no other was begotten from Him. This is One Son,
   who is Word, Wisdom, Power; for God is not compounded of these, but is
   generative [3295] of them. For as He frames the creatures by the Word,
   so according to the nature of His own Essence has He the Word as an
   Offspring, through whom He frames and creates and dispenses all things.
   For by the Word and the Wisdom all things have come to be, and all
   things together remain according to His ordinance [3296] . And the same
   concerning the word Son;' if God be without Son [3297] , then is He
   without Work; for the Son is His Offspring through whom He works [3298]
   ; but if not, the same questions and the same absurdities will follow
   their audacity.

   5. From Deuteronomy; But ye that did attach yourselves unto the Lord
   your God are alive every one of you this day [3299] .' From this we may
   see the difference, and know that the Son of God is not a creature. For
   the Son says, I and the Father are One,' and, I in the Father, and the
   Father in Me;' but things originate, when they make advance, are
   attached unto the Lord. The Word then is in the Father as being His
   own; but things originate, being external, are attached, as being by
   nature foreign, and attached by free choice. For a son which is by
   nature, is one [3300] with him who begat him; but he who is from
   without, and is made a son, will be attached to the family. Therefore
   he immediately adds, What nation is there so great who hath God drawing
   nigh unto them [3301] ?' and elsewhere, I a God drawing nigh [3302] ;'
   for to things originate He draws nigh, as being strange to Him, but to
   the Son, as being His own, He does not draw nigh, but He is in Him. And
   the Son is not attached to the Father, but co-exists with Him; whence
   also Moses says again in the same Deuteronomy, Ye shall obey His voice,
   and apply yourselves unto Him [3303] ;' but what is applied, is applied
   from without.

   Â§Â§6, 7. When the Word and Son hungered, wept, and was wearied, He acted
   as our Mediator, taking on Him what was ours, that He might impart to
   us what was His.

   6. But in answer to the weak and human notion of the Arians, their
   supposing that the Lord is in want, when He says, Is given unto Me,'
   and I received,' and if Paul says, Wherefore He highly exalted Him,'
   and He set Him at the right hand [3304] ,' and the like, we must say
   that our Lord, being Word and Son of God, bore a body, and became Son
   of Man, that, having become Mediator between God, and men, He might
   minister the things of God to us, and ours to God. When then He is said
   to hunger and weep and weary, and to cry Eloi, Eloi, which are our
   human affections, He receives them from us and offers to the Father
   [3305] , interceding for us, that in Him they may be annulled [3306] .
   And when it is said, All power is given unto Me,' and I received,' and
   Wherefore God highly exalted Him,' these are gifts given from God to us
   through Him. For the Word was never in want [3307] , nor has come into
   being [3308] ; nor again were men sufficient to minister these things
   for themselves, but through the Word they are given to us; therefore,
   as if given to Him, they are imparted to us. For this was the reason of
   His becoming man, that, as being given to Him, they might pass on to us
   [3309] . For of such gifts mere man had not become worthy; and again
   the mere Word had not needed them [3310] ; the Word then was united to
   us, and then imparted to us power, and highly exalted us [3311] . For
   the Word being in man, highly exalted man himself; and, when the Word
   was in man, man himself received. Since then, the Word being in flesh,
   man himself was exalted, and received power, therefore these things are
   referred to the Word, since they were given on His account; for on
   account of the Word in man were these gifts given. And as the Word
   became flesh [3312] ,' so also man himself received the gifts which
   came through the Word. For all that man himself has received, the Word
   is said to have received [3313] ; that it might be shewn, that man
   himself, being unworthy to receive, as far as his own nature is
   concerned, yet has received because of the Word become flesh. Wherefore
   if anything be said to be given to the Lord, or the like, we must
   consider that it is given, not to Him as needing it, but to man himself
   through the Word. For every one interceding for another, receives the
   gift in his own person, not as needing, but on his account for whom he
   intercedes.

   7. For as He takes our infirmities, not being infirm [3314] , and
   hungers not hungering, but sends up what is ours that it may be
   abolished, so the gifts which come from God instead of our infirmities,
   doth He too Himself receive, that man, being united to Him, may be able
   to partake them. Hence it is that the Lord says, All things whatsoever
   Thou hast given Me, I have given them,' and again, I pray for them
   [3315] .' For He prayed for us, taking on Him what is ours, and He was
   giving what He received. Since then, the Word being united to man
   himself, the Father, regarding Him, vouchsafed to man to be exalted, to
   have all power and the like; therefore are referred to the Word
   Himself, and are as if given to Him, all things which through Him we
   receive. For as He for our sake became man, so we for His sake are
   exalted. It is no absurdity then, if, as for our sake He humbled
   Himself, so also for our sake He is said to be highly exalted. So He
   gave to Him,' that is, to us for His sake;' and He highly exalted Him
   [3316] ,' that is, us in Him.' And the Word Himself, when we are
   exalted, and receive, and are succoured, as if He Himself were exalted
   and received and were succoured, gives thanks to the Father, referring
   what is ours to Himself, and saying, All things, whatsoever Thou hast
   given Me, I have given unto them [3317] .'

   Â§8. Arians date the Son's beginning earlier than Marcellus, &c.

   8. Eusebius and his fellows, that is, the Ario-maniacs, ascribing a
   beginning of being to the Son, yet pretend not to wish Him to have a
   beginning of kingship [3318] . But this is ridiculous; for he who
   ascribes to the Son a beginning of being, very plainly ascribes to Him
   also a beginning of reigning; so blind are they, confessing what they
   deny. Again, those who say that the Son is only a name, and that the
   Son of God, that is, the Word of the Father, is unessential and
   non-subsistent, pretend to be angry with those who say, Once He was
   not.' This is ridiculous also; for they who give Him no being at all,
   are angry with those who at least grant Him to be in time. Thus these
   also confess what they deny, in the act of censuring the others. And
   again Eusebius and his fellows, confessing a Son, deny that He is the
   Word by nature, and would have the Son called Word notionally; and the
   others confessing Him to be Word, deny Him to be Son, and would have
   the Word called Son notionally, equally void of footing.

   Â§Â§9, 10. Unless Father and Son are two in name only, or as parts and so
   each imperfect, or two gods, they are coessential, one in Godhead, and
   the Son from the Father.

   9. I and the Father are One [3319] .' You say that the two things are
   one, or that the one has two names, or again that the one is divided
   into two. Now if the one is divided into two, that which is divided
   must need be a body, and neither part perfect, for each is a part and
   not a whole. But if again the one have two names, this is the expedient
   of Sabellius, who said that Son and Father were the same, and did away
   with either, the Father when there is a Son, and the Son when there is
   a Father. But if the two are one, then of necessity they are two, but
   one according to the Godhead, and according to the Son's coessentiality
   with the Father, and the Word's being from the Father Himself; so that
   there are two, because there is Father, and Son, namely the Word; and
   one because one God. For if not, He would have said, I am the Father,'
   or I and the Father am;' but, in fact, in the I' He signifies the Son,
   and in the And the Father,' Him who begat Him; and in the One' the one
   Godhead and His coessentiality [3320] . For the Same is not, as the
   Gentiles hold, Wise and Wisdom, or the Same Father and Word; for it
   were unfit for Him to be His own Father, but the divine teaching knows
   Father and Son, and Wise and Wisdom, and God and Word; while it ever
   guards Him indivisible and inseparable and indissoluble in all
   respects.

   10. But if any one, on hearing that the Father and the Son are two,
   misrepresent us as preaching two Gods (for this is what some feign to
   themselves, and forthwith mock, saying, You hold two Gods'), we must
   answer to such, If to acknowledge Father and Son, is to hold two Gods,
   it instantly [3321] follows that to confess but one we must deny the
   Son and Sabellianise. For if to speak of two is to fall into Gentilism,
   therefore if we speak of one, we must fall into Sabellianism. But this
   is not so; perish the thought! but, as when we say that Father and Son
   are two, we still confess one God, so when we say that there is one
   God, let us consider Father and Son two, while they are one in the
   Godhead, and in the Father's Word being indissoluble and indivisible
   and inseparable from Him. And let the fire and the radiance from it be
   a similitude of man, which are two in being and in appearance, but one
   in that its radiance is from it indivisibly.

   Â§Â§11, 12. Marcellus and his disciples, like Arians, say that the Word
   was, not indeed created, but issued, to create us, as if the Divine
   silence were a state of inaction, and when God spake by the Word, He
   acted; or that there was a going forth and return of the Word; a
   doctrine which implies change and imperfection in Father and Son.

   11. They fall into the same folly with the Arians; for Arians also say
   that He was created for us, that He might create us, as if God waited
   till our creation for His issue, as the one party say, or His creation,
   as the other. Arians then are more bountiful to us than to the Son; for
   they say, not we for His sake, but He for ours, came to be; that is, if
   He was therefore created, and subsisted, that God through Him might
   create us. And these, as irreligious or more so, give to God less than
   to us. For we oftentimes, even when silent, yet are active in thinking,
   so as to form the results of our thoughts into images; but God they
   would have inactive when silent, and when He speaks then to exert
   strength; if, that is, when silent He could not make, and when speaking
   He began to create. For it is just to ask them, whether the Word, when
   He was in God, was perfect, so as to be able to make. If on the one
   hand He was imperfect, when in God, but by being begotten became
   perfect [3322] , we are the cause of His perfection, that is, if He has
   been begotten for us; for on our behalf He has received the power of
   making. But if He was perfect in God, so as to be able to make, His
   generation is superfluous; for He, even when in the Father, could frame
   the world; so that either He has not been begotten, or He was begotten,
   not for us, but because He is ever from the Father. For His generation
   evidences, not that we were created, but that He is from God; for He
   was even before our creation.

   12. And the same presumption will be proved against them concerning the
   Father; for if, when silent, He could not make, of necessity He has
   gained power by begetting, that is, by speaking. And whence has He
   gained it? and wherefore? If, when He had the Word within Him, He could
   make, He begets needlessly, being able to make even in silence. Next,
   if the Word was in God before He was begotten, then being begotten He
   is without and external to Him. But if so, how says He now, I in the
   Father and the Father in Me [3323] ?' but if He is now in the Father,
   then always was He in the Father, as He is now, and needless is it to
   say, For us was He begotten, and He reverts after we are formed, that
   He may be as He was.' For He was not anything which He is not now, nor
   is He what He was not; but He is as He ever was, and in the same state
   and in the same respects; otherwise He will seem to be imperfect and
   alterable. For if, what He was, that He shall be afterwards, as if now
   He were not so, it is plain, He is not now what He was and shall be. I
   mean, if He was before in God, and afterwards shall be again, it
   follows that now the Word is not in God. But the Lord refutes such
   persons when He says, I in the Father and the Father in Me;' for so is
   He now as He ever was. But if so He now is, as He was ever, it follows,
   not that at one time He was begotten and not at another, nor that once
   there was silence with God, and then He spake, but there is ever a
   Father [3324] , and a Son who is His Word, not in name [3325] alone a
   Word, nor the Word in notion only a Son, but existing coessential
   [3326] with the Father, not begotten for us, for we are brought into
   being for Him. For, if He were begotten for us, and in His begetting we
   were created, and in His generation the creature consists, and then He
   returns that He may be what He was before, first, He that was begotten
   will be again not begotten. For if His progression be generation, His
   return will be the close [3327] of that generation, for when He has
   come to be in God, God will be silent again. But if He shall be silent,
   there will be what there was when He was silent, stillness and not
   creation, for the creation will cease to be. For, as on the Word's
   outgoing, the creation came to be, and existed, so on the Word's
   retiring, the creation will not exist. What use then for it to come
   into being, if it is to cease? or why did God speak, that then He
   should be silent? and why did He issue One whom He recalls? and why did
   He beget One whose generation He willed to cease? Again it is uncertain
   what He shall be. For either He will ever be silent, or He will again
   beget, and will devise a different creation (for He will not make the
   same, else that which was made would have remained, but another); and
   in due course He will bring that also to a close, and will devise
   another, and so on without end [3328] .

   13. This perhaps he [3329] borrowed from the Stoics, who maintain that
   their God contracts and again expands with the creation, and then rests
   without end. For what is dilated is first straitened; and what is
   expanded is at first contracted; and it is what it was, and does but
   undergo an affection. If then the Monad being dilated became a Triad,
   and the Monad was the Father [3330] , and the Triad is Father, Son, and

   became what it was not; for it was dilated, whereas it had not been
   dilate. Next, if the Monad itself was dilated into a Triad, and that,
   Father and Son and Holy Ghost, then Father and Son and Spirit prove the
   same, as Sabellius held, unless the Monad which he speaks of is
   something besides the Father, and then he ought not to speak of
   dilatation, since the Monad was to make Three, so that there was a
   Monad, and then Father, Son, and Spirit. For if the Monad were dilated,
   and expanded itself, it must itself be that which was expanded. And a
   Triad when dilated is no longer a Monad, and when a Monad it is not yet
   a Triad. And so, He that was Father was not yet Son and Spirit; but,
   when become These, is no longer only Father. And a man who thus should
   lie, must ascribe a body to God, and represent Him as passible; for
   what is dilatation, but an affection of that which is dilated? or what
   the dilated, but what before was not so, but was strait indeed; for it
   is the same, in time only differing from itself.

   14. And this the divine Apostle knows, when he writes to the
   Corinthians, Be ye not straitened in us, but be ye yourselves dilated,
   O Corinthians [3331] ;' for he advises identical persons to change from
   straitness to dilatation. And as, supposing the Corinthians being
   straitened were in turn dilated, they had not been others, but still
   Corinthians, so if the Father was dilated into a Triad, the Triad again
   is the Father alone. And he says again the same thing, Our heart is
   dilated [3332] ;' and Noah says, May God dilate for Japheth [3333] ,'
   for the same heart and the same Japheth is in the dilatation. If then
   the Monad dilated, it would dilate for others; but if it dilated for
   itself, then it would be that which was dilated; and what is that but
   the Son and Holy Spirit? And it is well to ask him, when thus speaking,
   what was the action [3334] of this dilatation? or, in very truth,
   wherefore at all it took place? for what does not remain the same, but
   is in course of time dilated, must necessarily have a cause of
   dilatation. If then it was in order that Word and Spirit should be with
   Him, it is beside the purpose to say, First Monad, and then dilated;'
   for Word and Spirit were not afterwards, but ever, or God would be
   wordless [3335] , as the Arians hold. So that if Word and Spirit were
   ever, ever was it dilated, and not at first a Monad; but if it were
   dilated afterwards, then afterwards is there a Word. But if for the
   Incarnation it was dilated, and then became a Triad, then before the
   Incarnation there was not yet a Triad. And it will seem even that the
   Father became flesh, if, that is, He be the Monad, and was dilated in
   the Man; and thus perhaps there will only be a Monad, and flesh, and
   thirdly Spirit; if, that is, He was Himself dilated; and there will be
   in name only a Triad. It is absurd too to say that it was dilated for
   creating; for it were possible for it, remaining a Monad, to make all;
   for the Monad did not need dilatation, nor was wanting in power before
   being dilated; it is absurd surely and impious, to think or speak thus
   in the case of God. Another absurdity too will follow. For if it was
   dilated for the sake of the creation, and while it was a Monad the
   creation was not, but upon the Consummation it will be again a Monad
   after dilatation, then the creation too will come to nought. For as for
   the sake of creating it was dilated, so, the dilatation ceasing, the
   creation will cease also.

   Â§Â§15-24. Since the Word is from God, He must be Son. Since the Son is
   from everlasting, He must be the Word; else either He is superior to
   the Word, or the Word is the Father. Texts of the New Testament which
   state the unity of the Son with the Father; therefore the Son is the
   Word. Three hypotheses refuted--1. That the Man is the Son; 2. That the
   Word and Man together are the Son; 3. That the Word became Son on His
   incarnation. Texts of the Old Testament which speak of the Son. If they
   are merely prophetical, then those concerning the Word may be such
   also.

   15. Such absurdities will be the consequence of saying that the Monad
   is dilated into a Triad. But since those who say so venture to separate
   Word and Son, and to say that the Word is one and the Son another, and
   that first was the Word and then the Son, come let us consider this
   doctrine also. Now their presumption takes various forms; for some say
   that the man whom the Saviour assumed is the Son [3336] ; and others
   both that the man and the Word then became Son, when they were united
   [3337] . And others say that the Word Himself then became Son when He
   became man [3338] ; for from being Word, they say, He has become Son,
   not being Son before, but only Word. Now both are Stoic [3339]
   doctrines, whether to say that God was dilated or to deny the Son, but
   especially is it absurd to name the Word, yet deny Him to be Son. For
   if the Word be not from God, reasonably might they deny Him to be Son;
   but if He is from God, how see they not that what exists from anything
   is son of him from whom it is? Next, if God is Father of the Word, why
   is not the Word Son of His own Father? for one is and is called father,
   whose is the son; and one is and is called son of another, whose is the
   father. If then God is not Father of Christ, neither is the Word Son;
   but if God be Father, then reasonably also the Word is Son. But if
   afterwards there is Father, and first God, this is an Arian thought
   [3340] . Next, it is absurd that God should change; for that belongs to
   bodies; but if they argue that in the instance of creation He became
   afterwards a Maker, let them know that the change is in the things
   [3341] which afterwards came to be, and not in God.

   16. If then the Son too were a work, well might God begin to be a
   Father towards Him as others; but if the Son is not a work, then ever
   was the Father and ever the Son [3342] . But if the Son was ever, He
   must be the Word; for if the Word be not Son, and this is what a man
   waxes bold to say, either he holds that Word to be Father or the Son
   superior to the Word. For the Son being in the bosom of the Father
   [3343] ,' of necessity either the Word is not before the Son (for
   nothing is before Him who is in the Father), or if the Word be other
   than the Son, the Word must be the Father in whom is the Son. But if
   the Word is not Father but Word, the Word must be external to the
   Father, since it is the Son who is in the bosom of the Father.' For not
   both the Word and the Son are in the bosom, but one must be, and He the
   Son, who is Only-begotten. And it follows for another reason, if the
   Word is one, and the Son another, that the Son is superior to the Word;
   for no one knoweth the Father save the Son [3344] ,' not the Word.
   Either then the Word does not know, or if He knows, it is not true that
   no one knows.' And the same of He that hath seen Me, hath seen the
   Father,' and I and the Father are One,' for this is uttered by the Son,
   not the Word, as they would have it, as is plain from the Gospel; for
   according to John when the Lord said, I and the Father are One,' the
   Jews took up stones to stone Him. Jesus [3345] answered them, Many good
   works have I shewed you from My Father, for which of those works do ye
   stone Me? The Jews answered Him, saying, For a good work we stone Thee
   not, but for blasphemy, and because that Thou, being a man, makest
   Thyself God. Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I
   said, Ye are gods? If he called them gods unto whom the Word of God
   came, and the Scripture cannot be broken, say ye of Him, whom the
   Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest,
   because I said, I am the Son of God? If I do not the works of My
   Father, believe Me not. But if I do, though ye believe not Me, believe
   the works, that ye may know and believe that the Father is in Me, and I
   in the Father.' And yet, as far as the surface of the words intimated,
   He said neither I am God,' nor I am Son of God,' but I and the Father
   are One.'

   17. The Jews then, when they heard One,' thought like Sabellius that He
   said that He was the Father, but our Saviour shews their sin by this
   argument: Though I had said "God," you should have remembered what is
   written, "I said, Ye are gods;"' then to clear up I and the Father are
   One,' He has explained the Son's oneness with the Father in the words,
   Because I said, I am the Son of God.' For if He did not say it in
   words, still He has referred the sense of are One' to the Son. For
   nothing is one with the Father, but what is from Him. What is that
   which is from Him but the Son? And therefore He adds, that ye may know
   that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me.' For, when expounding
   the One,' He said that the union and the inseparability lay, not in
   This being That, with which It was One, but in His being in the Father
   and the Father in the Son. For thus He overthrows both Sabellius, in
   saying, I am' not, "the Father," but, the Son of God;' and Arius, in
   saying, are One.' If then the Son and the Word are not the same, it is
   not that the Word is one with the Father, but the Son; nor he that hath
   seen the Word hath seen the Father,' but he that hath seen' the Son.
   And from this it follows, either that the Son is greater than the Word,
   or the Word has nothing beyond the Son. For what can be greater or more
   perfect than One,' and I in the Father and the Father in Me,' and He
   that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father?' for these utterances also
   belong to the Son. And hence the same John says, He that hath seen Me,
   hath seen Him that sent Me,' and, He that receiveth Me, receiveth Him
   that sent Me;' and, I am come a light into the world, that whosoever
   believeth in Me, should not abide in darkness. And, if any one hear My
   words and observe them not, I judge him not; for I came not to judge
   the world, but to save the world. The word which he shall hear, the
   same shall judge him in the last day, because I go unto the Father
   [3346] .' The preaching, He says, judges him who has not observed the
   commandment; for if,' He says, I had not come and spoken unto them,
   they had not had sin; but now they shall have no cloke [3347] ,' He
   says, having heard My words, through which those who observe them shall
   reap salvation.

   18. Perhaps they will have so little shame as to say, that this
   utterance belongs not to the Son but to the Word; but from what
   preceded it appeared plainly that the speaker was the Son. For He who
   here says, I came not to judge the world but to save [3348] ,' is shewn
   to be no other than the Only-begotten Son of God, by the same John's
   saying before [3349] , For God so loved the world that He gave His
   Only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on Him should not perish,
   but have everlasting life. For God sent not His Son into the world to
   condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. He
   that believeth on Him is not condemned, but he that believeth not is
   condemned already, because he hath not believed in the Name of the
   Only-begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that light is
   come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because
   their deeds are evil [3350] .' If He who says, For I came not to judge
   the world, but that I might save it,' is the Same as says, He that
   seeth Me, seeth Him that sent Me [3351] ,' and if He who came to save
   the world and not judge it is the Only-begotten Son of God, it is plain
   that it is the same Son who says, He that seeth Me, seeth Him that sent
   Me.' For He who said, He that believeth on Me,' and, If any one hear My
   words, I judge him not,' is the Son Himself, of whom Scripture says, He
   that believeth on Him is not condemned, but He that believeth not is
   condemned already, because He hath not believed in the Name of the
   Only-begotten Son of God.' And again: And this is the condemnation' of
   him who believeth not on the Son, that light hath come into the world,'
   and they believed not in Him, that is, in the Son; for He must be the
   Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world [3352] .' And
   as long as He was upon earth according to the Incarnation, He was Light
   in the world, as He said Himself, While ye have light, believe in the
   light, that ye may be the children of light;' for I,' says He, am come
   a light into the world [3353] .'

   19. This then being shewn, it follows that the Word is the Son. But if
   the Son is the Light, which has come into the world, beyond all dispute
   the world was made by the Son. For in the beginning of the Gospel, the
   Evangelist, speaking of John the Baptist, says, He was not that Light,
   but that he might bear witness concerning that Light [3354] .' For
   Christ Himself was, as we have said before, the True Light that
   lighteth every man that cometh into the world. For if He was in the
   world, and the world was made by Him [3355] ,' of necessity He is the
   Word of God, concerning whom also the Evangelist witnesses that all
   things were made by Him. For either they will be compelled to speak of
   two worlds, that the one may have come into being by the Son and the
   other by the Word, or, if the world is one and the creation one, it
   follows that Son and Word are one and the same before all creation, for
   by Him it came into being. Therefore if as by the Word, so by the Son
   also all things came to be, it will not be contradictory, but even
   identical to say, for instance, In the beginning was the Word,' or, In
   the beginning was the Son.' But if because John did not say, In the
   beginning was the Son,' they shall maintain that the attributes of the
   Word do not suit with the Son, it at once follows that the attributes
   of the Son do not suit with the Word. But it was shewn that to the Son
   belongs, I and the Father are One,' and that it is He Who is in the
   bosom of the Father,' and, He that seeth Me, seeth Him that sent Me
   [3356] ;' and that the world was brought into being by Him,' is common
   to the Word and the Son; so that from this the Son is shewn to be
   before the world; for of necessity the Framer is before the things
   brought into being. And what is said to Philip must belong, according
   to them, not to the Word, but to the Son. For, Jesus said,' says
   Scripture, Have I been so long time with you, and yet thou hast not
   known Me, Philip? He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father. And how
   sayest thou then, Shew us the Father? Believest thou not, that I am in
   the Father and the Father in Me? the words that I speak unto you, I
   speak not of Myself, but the Father that dwelleth in Me, He doeth the
   works. Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me, or
   else, believe Me for the very works' sake. Verily, verily, I say unto
   you, he that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also, and
   greater works than these shall he do, because I go unto the Father. And
   whatsoever ye shall ask in My Name, that will I do, that the Father may
   be glorified in the Son [3357] .' Therefore if the Father be glorified
   in the Son, the Son must be He who said, I in the Father and the Father
   in Me;' and He who said, He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father;'
   for He, the same who thus spoke, shews Himself to be the Son, by
   adding, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.'

   20. If then they say that the Man whom the Word wore, and not the Word,
   is the Son of God the Only-begotten, the Man must be by consequence He
   who is in the Father, in whom also the Father is; and the Man must be
   He who is One with the Father, and who is in the bosom of the Father,
   and the True Light. And they will be compelled to say that through the
   Man Himself the world came into being, and that the Man was He who came
   not to judge the world but to save it; and that He it was who was in
   being before Abraham came to be. For, says Scripture, Jesus said to
   them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, before Abraham was, I am [3358]
   .' And is it not absurd to say, as they do, that one who came of the
   seed of Abraham after two and forty generations [3359] , should exist
   before Abraham came to be? is it not absurd, if the flesh, which the
   Word bore, itself is the Son, to say that the flesh from Mary is that
   by which the world was made? and how will they retain He was in the
   world?' for the Evangelist, by way of signifying the Son's antecedence
   to the birth according to the flesh, goes on to say, He was in the
   world.' And how, if not the Word but the Man is the Son, can He save
   the world, being Himself one of the world? And if this does not shame
   them, where shall be the Word, the Man being in the Father? And where
   will the Word stand to the Father, the Man and the Father being One?
   But if the Man be Only-begotten, what will be the place of the Word?
   Either one must say that He comes second, or, if He be above the
   Only-begotten, He must be the Father Himself. For as the Father is One,
   so also the Only-begotten from Him is One; and what has the Word above
   the Man, if the Word is not the Son? For, while Scripture says that
   through the Son and the Word the world was brought to be, and it is
   common to the Word and to the Son to frame the world, yet Scripture
   proceeds to place the sight of the Father, not in the Word but in the
   Son, and to attribute the saving of the world, not to the Word, but to
   the Only-begotten Son. For, saith it, Jesus said, Have I been so long
   while with you, and yet hast thou not known Me, Philip? He that hath
   seen Me, hath seen the Father.' Nor does Scripture say that the Word
   knows the Father, but the Son; and that not the Word sees the Father,
   but the Only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father.

   21. And what more does the Word contribute to our salvation than the
   Son, if, as they hold, the Son is one, and the Word another? for the
   command is that we should believe, not in the Word, but in the Son. For
   John says, He that believeth on the Son, hath everlasting life; but he
   that believeth not the Son, shall not see life [3360] .' And Holy
   Baptism, in which the substance of the whole faith is lodged, is
   administered not in the Word, but in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. If
   then, as they hold, the Word is one and the Son another, and the Word
   is not the Son, Baptism has no connection with the Word. How then are
   they able to hold that the Word is with the Father, when He is not with
   Him in the giving of Baptism? But perhaps they will say, that in the
   Father's Name the Word is included? Wherefore then not the Spirit also?
   or is the Spirit external to the Father? and the Man indeed (if the
   Word is not Son) is named after the Father, but the Spirit after the
   Man? and then the Monad, instead of dilating into a Triad, dilates
   according to them into a Tetrad, Father, Word, Son, and Holy Ghost.
   Being brought to shame on this ground, they have recourse to another,
   and say that not the Man by Himself whom the Lord bore, but both
   together, the Word and the Man, are the Son; for both joined together
   are named Son, as they say. Which then is cause of which? and which has
   made which a Son? or, to speak more clearly, is the Word a Son because
   of the flesh? or is the flesh called Son because of the Word? or is
   neither the cause, but the concurrence of the two? If then the Word be
   a Son because of the flesh, of necessity the flesh is Son, and all
   those absurdities follow which have been already drawn from saying that
   the Man is Son. But if the flesh is called Son because of the Word,
   then even before the flesh the Word certainly, being such, was Son. For
   how could a being make other sons, not being himself a son, especially
   when there was a father [3361] ? If then He makes sons for Himself,
   then is He Himself Father; but if for the Father, then must He be Son,
   or rather that Son, by reason of Whom the rest are made sons.

   22. For if, while He is not Son, we are sons, God is our Father and not
   His. How then does He appropriate the name instead, saying, My Father,'
   and I from the Father [3362] ?' for if He be common Father of all, He
   is not His Father only, nor did He alone come out from the Father. But
   he says, that He is sometimes called our Father also, because He has
   Himself become partaker in our flesh. For on this account the Word has
   become flesh, that, since the Word is Son, therefore, because of the
   Son dwelling in us [3363] , He may be called our Father also; for He
   sent forth,' says Scripture, the Spirit of His Son into our hearts,
   crying, Abba, Father [3364] .' Therefore the Son in us, calling upon
   His own Father, causes Him to be named our Father also. Surely in whose
   hearts the Son is not, of them neither can God be called Father. But if
   because of the Word the Man is called Son, it follows necessarily,
   since the ancients [3365] are called sons even before the Incarnation,
   that the Word is Son even before His sojourn among us; for I begat
   sons,' saith Scripture; and in the time of Noah, When the sons of God
   saw,' and in the Song, Is not He thy Father [3366] ?' Therefore there
   was also that True Son, for whose sake they too were sons. But if, as
   they say again, neither of the two is Son, but it depends on the
   concurrence of the two, it follows that neither is Son; I say, neither
   the Word nor the Man, but some cause, on account of which they were
   united; and accordingly that cause which makes the Son will precede the
   uniting. Therefore in this way also the Son was before the flesh. When
   this then is urged, they will take refuge in another pretext, saying,
   neither that the Man is Son, nor both together, but that the Word was
   Word indeed simply in the beginning, but when He became Man, then He
   was named [3367] Son; for before His appearing He was not Son but Word
   only; and as the Word became flesh,' not being flesh before, so the
   Word became Son, not being Son before. Such are their idle words; but
   they admit of an obvious refutation.

   23. For if simply, when made Man, He has become Son, the becoming Man
   is the cause. And if the Man is cause of His being Son, or both
   together, then the same absurdities result. Next, if He is first Word
   and then Son, it will appear that He knew the Father afterwards, not
   before; for not as being Word does He know Him, but as Son. For No one
   knoweth the Father but the Son.' And this too will result, that He has
   come afterwards to be in the bosom of the Father [3368] ,' and
   afterwards He and the Father have become One; and afterwards is, He
   that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father [3369] .' For all these things
   are said of the Son. Hence they will be forced to say, The Word was
   nothing but a name. For neither is it He who is in us with the Father,
   nor whoso has seen the Word, hath seen the Father, nor was the Father
   known to any one at all, for through the Son is the Father known (for
   so it is written, And he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him'), and,
   the Word not being yet Son, not yet did any know the Father. How then
   was He seen by Moses, how by the fathers? for He says Himself in the
   Kingdoms, Was I not plainly revealed to the house of thy father [3370]
   ?' But if God was revealed, there must have been a Son to reveal, as He
   says Himself, And he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him.' It is
   irreligious then and foolish to say that the Word is one and the Son
   another, and whence they gained such an idea it were well to ask them.
   They answer, Because no mention is made in the Old Testament of the
   Son, but of the Word; and for this reason they are positive in their
   opinion that the Son came later than the Word, because not in the Old,
   but in the New only, is He spoken of. This is what they irreligiously
   say; for first to separate between the Testaments, so that the one does
   not hold with the other, is the device of Manichees and Jews, the one
   of whom oppose the Old, and the other the New [3371] . Next, on their
   shewing, if what is contained in the Old is of older date, and what in
   the New of later, and times depend upon the writing, it follows that I
   and the Father are One,' and Only-begotten,' and He that hath seen Me
   hath seen the Father [3372] ,' are later, for these testimonies are
   adduced not from the Old but from the New.

   24. But it is not so; for in truth much is said in the Old also about
   the Son, as in the second Psalm, Thou art My Son, this day have I
   begotten Thee [3373] ;' and in the ninth the title [3374] , Unto the
   end concerning the hidden things of the Son, a Psalm of David;' and in
   the forty-fourth, Unto the end, concerning the things that shall be
   changed to the Sons of Korah for understanding, a song about the
   Well-beloved;' and in Isaiah, I will sing to my Well-beloved a song of
   my Well-beloved touching my vineyard. My Well-beloved hath a vineyard
   [3375] ;' Who is this Well-beloved' but the Only-begotten Son? as also
   in the hundred and ninth, From the womb I begat Thee before the morning
   star [3376] ,' concerning which I shall speak afterwards; and in the
   Proverbs, Before the hills He begat me;' and in Daniel, And the form of
   the Fourth is like the Son of God [3377] ;' and many others. If then
   from the Old be ancientness, ancient must be the Son, who is clearly
   described in the Old Testament in many places. Yes,' they say, so it
   is, but it must be taken prophetically.' Therefore also the Word must
   be said to be spoken of prophetically; for this is not to be taken one
   way, that another. For if Thou art My Son' refer to the future, so does
   By the Word of the Lord were the heavens established;' for it is not
   said were brought to be,' nor He made.' But that established' refers to
   the future, it states elsewhere: The Lord reigned [3378] ,' followed by
   He so established the earth that it can never be moved.' And if the
   words in the forty-fourth Psalm for My Well-beloved' refer to the
   future, so does what follows upon them, My heart uttered a good Word.'
   And if From the womb' relates to a man, therefore also From the heart.'
   For if the womb is human, so is the heart corporeal. But if what is
   from the heart is eternal, then what is From the womb' is eternal. And
   if the Only-begotten' is in the bosom,' therefore the Well-beloved' is
   in the bosom.' For Only-begotten' and Well-beloved' are the same, as in
   the words This is My Well-beloved Son [3379] .' For not as wishing to
   signify His love towards Him did He say Well-beloved,' as if it might
   appear that He hated others, but He made plain thereby His being
   Only-begotten, that He might shew that He alone was from Him. And hence
   the Word, with a view of conveying to Abraham the idea of
   Only-begotten,' says, Offer thy son thy well-beloved [3380] ;' but it
   is plain to any one that Isaac was the only son from Sara. The Word
   then is Son, not lately come to be, or named Son, but always Son. For
   if not Son, neither is He Word; and if not Word, neither is He Son. For
   that which is from the father is a son; and what is from the Father,
   but that Word that went forth from the heart, and was born from the
   womb? for the Father is not Word, nor the Word Father, but the one is
   Father, and the other Son; and one begets, and the other is begotten.

   Â§25. Marcellian illustration from 1 Cor. xii. 4, refuted.

   25. Arius then raves in saying that the Son is from nothing, and that
   once He was not, while Sabellius also raves in saying that the Father
   is Son, and again, the Son Father [3381] , in subsistence [3382] One,
   in name Two; and he [3383] raves also in using as an example the grace
   of the Spirit. For he says, As there are "diversities of gifts, but the
   same Spirit," so also the Father is the same [3384] , but is dilated
   into Son and Spirit.' Now this is full of absurdity; for if as with the
   Spirit, so it is with God, the Father will be Word and Holy Spirit, to
   one becoming Father, to another Son, to another Spirit, accommodating
   himself to the need of each, and in name indeed Son and Spirit, but in
   reality Father only; having a beginning in that He becomes a Son, and
   then ceasing to be called Father, and made man in name, but in truth
   not even coming among us; and untrue in saying I and the Father,' but
   in reality being Himself the Father, and the other absurdities which
   result in the instance of Sabellius. And the name of the Son and the
   Spirit will necessarily cease, when the need has been supplied; and
   what happens will altogether be but make-belief, because it has been
   displayed, not in truth, but in name. And the Name of Son ceasing, as
   they hold, then the grace of Baptism will cease too; for it was given
   in the Son [3385] . Nay, what will follow but the annihilation of the
   creation? for if the Word came forth that we might be created [3386] ,
   and when He was come forth, we were, it is plain that when He retires
   into the Father, as they say, we shall be no longer. For He will be as
   He was; so also we shall not be, as then we were not; for when He is no
   more gone forth, there will no more be a creation. This then is absurd.

   Â§Â§26-36. That the Son is the Co-existing Word, argued from the New
   Testament. Texts from the Old Testament continued; especially Ps. cx.
   3. Besides, the Word in Old Testament may be Son in New, as Spirit in
   Old Testament is Paraclete in New. Objection from Acts x. 36; answered
   by parallels, such as 1 Cor. i. 5. Lev. ix. 7. &c. Necessity of the
   Word's taking flesh, viz. to sanctify, yet without destroying, the
   flesh.

   26. But that the Son has no beginning of being, but before He was made
   man was ever with the Father, John makes clear in his first Epistle,
   writing thus: That which was from the beginning, which we have heard,
   which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our
   hands have handled of the Word of Life; and the Life was manifested,
   and we have seen it; and we bear witness and declare unto you that
   Eternal Life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us
   [3387] .' While he says here that the Life,' not became,' but was with
   the Father,' in the end of his Epistle he says the Son is the Life,
   writing, And we are in Him that is True, even in His Son, Jesus Christ;
   this is the True God and Eternal Life [3388] .' But if the Son is the
   Life, and the Life was with the Father, and if the Son was with the
   Father, and the same Evangelist says, And the Word was with God [3389]
   ,' the Son must be the Word, which is ever with the Father. And as the
   Son' is Word,' so God' must be the Father.' Moreover, the Son,
   according to John, is not merely God' but True God;' for according to
   the same Evangelist, And the Word was God;' and the Son said, I am the
   Life [3390] .' Therefore the Son is the Word and Life which is with the
   Father. And again, what is said in the same John, The Only-begotten Son
   which is in the bosom of the Father [3391] ,' shews that the Son was
   ever. For whom John calls Son, Him David mentions in the Psalm as God's
   Hand [3392] , saying, Why stretchest Thou not forth Thy Right Hand out
   of Thy bosom [3393] ?' Therefore if the Hand is in the bosom, and the
   Son in the bosom, the Son will be the Hand, and the Hand will be the
   Son, through whom the Father made all things; for it is written, Thy
   Hand made all these things,' and He led out His people with His Hand
   [3394] ;' therefore through the Son. And if this is the changing of the
   Right Hand of the Most Highest,' and again, Unto the end, concerning
   the things that shall be changed, a song for My Well-beloved [3395] ;'
   the Well-beloved then is the Hand that was changed; concerning whom the
   Divine Voice also says, This is My Beloved Son.' This My Hand' then is
   equivalent to This My Son.'

   27. But since there are ill-instructed men who, while resisting the
   doctrine of a Son, think little of the words, From the womb before the
   morning star I begat Thee [3396] ;' as if this referred to His relation
   to Mary, alleging that He was born of Mary before the morning star,'
   for that to say womb' could not refer to His relation towards God, we
   must say a few words here. If then, because the womb' is human,
   therefore it is foreign to God, plainly heart' too has a human meaning
   [3397] , for that which has heart has womb also. Since then both are
   human, we must deny both, or seek to explain both. Now as a word is
   from the heart, so is an offspring from the womb; and as when the heart
   of God is spoken of, we do not conceive of it as human, so if Scripture
   says from the womb,' we must not take it in a corporeal sense. For it
   is usual with divine Scripture to speak and signify in the way of man
   what is above man. Thus speaking of the creation it says, Thy hands
   made me and fashioned me,' and, Thy hand made all these things,' and,
   He commanded and they were created [3398] .' Suitable then is its
   language about everything; attributing to the Son propriety' and
   genuineness,' and to the creation the beginning of being.' For the one
   God makes and creates; but Him He begets from Himself, Word or Wisdom.
   Now womb' and heart' plainly declare the proper and the genuine; for we
   too have this from the womb; but our works we make by the hand.

   28. What means then, say they, Before the morning star?' I would
   answer, that if Before the morning star' shews that His birth from Mary
   was wonderful, many others besides have been born before the rising of
   the star. What then is said so wonderful in His instance, that He
   should record it as some choice prerogative [3399] , when it is common
   to many? Next, to beget differs from bringing forth; for begetting
   involves the primary foundation, but to bring forth is nothing else
   than the production of what exists. If then the term belongs to the
   body, let it be observed that He did not then receive a beginning of
   coming to be when he was evangelized to the shepherds by night, but
   when the Angel spoke to the Virgin. And that was not night, for this is
   not said; on the contrary, it was night when He issued from the womb.
   This difference Scripture makes, and says on the one hand that He was
   begotten before the morning star, and on the other speaks of His
   proceeding from the womb, as in the twenty-first Psalm, Thou art he
   that drew Me from the womb [3400] .' Besides, He did not say, before
   the rising of the morning star,' but simply before the morning star.'
   If then the phrase must be taken of the body, then either the body must
   be before Adam, for the stars were before Adam, or we have to
   investigate the sense of the letter. And this John enables us to do,
   who says in the Apocalypse, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the
   last, the beginning and the end. Blessed are they who make broad their
   robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in
   through the gates into the city. For without are dogs, and sorcerers,
   and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever maketh
   and loveth a lie. I Jesus have sent My Angel, to testify these things
   in the Churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the Bright
   and Morning Star. And the Spirit and the Bride say, Come; and let him
   that heareth say, Come; and let him that is athirst, Come; and
   whosoever will, let him take of the water of life freely [3401] .' If
   then the Offspring of David' be the Bright and Morning Star,' it is
   plain that the flesh of the Saviour is called the Morning Star,' which
   the Offspring from God preceded; so that the sense of the Psalm is
   this, I have begotten Thee from Myself before Thy appearance in the
   flesh;' for before the Morning Star' is equivalent to before the
   Incarnation of the Word.'

   29. Thus in the Old also, statements are plainly made concerning the
   Son; at the same time it is superfluous to argue the point; for if what
   is not stated in the Old is of later date, let them who are thus
   disputatious, say where in the Old is mention made of the Spirit, the
   Paraclete? for of the Holy Spirit there is mention, but nowhere of the
   Paraclete. Is then the Holy Spirit one, and the Paraclete another, and
   the Paraclete the later, as not mentioned in the Old? but far be it to
   say that the Spirit is later, or to distinguish the Holy Ghost as one
   and the Paraclete as another; for the Spirit is one and the same, then
   and now hallowing and comforting those who are His recipients; as one
   and the same Word and Son led even then to adoption of sons those who
   were worthy [3402] . For sons under the Old were made such through no
   other than the Son. For unless even before Mary there were a Son who
   was of God, how is He before all, when they are sons before Him? and
   how also First-born,' if He comes second after many? But neither is the
   Paraclete second, for He was before all, nor the Son later; for in the
   beginning was the Word [3403] .' And as the Spirit and Paraclete are
   the same, so the Son and Word are the same; and as the Saviour says
   concerning the Spirit, But the Paraclete which is the Holy Ghost, whom
   the Father will send in My Name [3404] ,' speaking of One and Same, and
   not distinguishing, so John describes similarly when he says, And the
   Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, glory
   as of one Only-begotten from the Father [3405] .' For here too he does
   not distinguish but witnesses the identity. And as the Paraclete is not
   one and the Holy Ghost another, but one and the same, so Word is not
   one, and Son another, but the Word is Only-Begotten; for He says not
   the glory of the flesh itself, but of the Word. He then who dares
   distinguish between Word and Son, let him distinguish between Spirit
   and Paraclete; but if the Spirit cannot be distinguished, so neither
   can the Word, being also Son and Wisdom and Power. Moreover, the word
   Well-beloved' even the Greeks who are skilful in phrases know to be
   equivalent with Only-begotten.' For Homer speaks thus of Telemachus,
   who was the only-begotten of Ulysses, in the second book of the
   Odyssey:

   O'er the wide earth, dear youth, why seek to run,

   An only child, a well-beloved [3406] son?

   He whom you mourn, divine Ulysses, fell

   Far from his country, where the strangers dwell.

   Therefore he who is the only son of his father is called well-beloved.

   30. Some of the followers of the Samosatene, distinguishing the Word
   from the Son, pretend that the Son is Christ, and the Word another; and
   they ground this upon Peter's words in the Acts, which he spoke well,
   but they explain badly [3407] . It is this: The Word He sent to the
   children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ; this is Lord of
   all [3408] .' For they say that since the Word spoke through Christ, as
   in the instance of the Prophets, Thus saith the Lord,' the prophet was
   one and the Lord another. But to this it is parallel to oppose the
   words in the first to the Corinthians, waiting for the revelation of
   our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall also confirm you unto the end
   unblameable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ [3409] .' For as one
   Christ does not confirm the day of another Christ, but He Himself
   confirms in His own day those who wait for Him, so the Father sent the
   Word made flesh, that being made man He might preach by means of
   Himself. And therefore he straightway adds, This is Lord of all;' but
   Lord of all is the Word.

   31. And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar and offer thy
   sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make an atonement for thyself
   and for the people; and offer the offering of the people, and make an
   atonement for them, as the Lord commanded Moses [3410] .' See now here,
   though Moses be one, Moses himself speaks as if about another Moses, as
   the Lord commanded Moses.' In like manner then, if the blessed Peter
   speak of the Divine Word also, as sent to the children of Israel by
   Jesus Christ, it is not necessary to understand that the Word is one
   and Christ another, but that they were one and the same by reason of
   the uniting which took place in His divine and loving condescension and
   becoming man. And even if He be considered in two ways [3411] , still
   it is without any division of the Word, as when the inspired John says,
   And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us [3412] .' What then is
   said well and rightly [3413] by the blessed Peter, the followers of the
   Samosatene, understanding badly and wrongly, stand not in the truth.
   For Christ is understood in both ways in Divine Scripture, as when it
   says Christ God's power and God's wisdom [3414] .' If then Peter says
   that the Word was sent through Jesus Christ unto the children of
   Israel, let him be understood to mean, that the Word incarnate has
   appeared to the children of Israel, so that it may correspond to And
   the Word became flesh.' But if they understand it otherwise, and, while
   confessing the Word to be divine, as He is, separate from Him the Man
   that He has taken, with which also we believe that He is made one,
   saying that He has been sent through Jesus Christ, they are, without
   knowing it, contradicting themselves. For those who in this place
   separate the divine Word from the divine Incarnation, have, it seems, a
   degraded notion of the doctrine of His having become flesh, and
   entertain Gentile thoughts, as they do, conceiving that the divine
   Incarnation is an alteration of the Word. But it is not so; perish the
   thought.

   32. For in the same way that John here preaches that incomprehensible
   union. the mortal being swallowed up of life [3415] ,' nay, of Him who
   is Very Life (as the Lord said to Martha, I am the Life [3416] '), so
   when the blessed Peter says that through Jesus Christ the Word was
   sent, he implies the divine union also. For as when a man heard The
   Word became flesh,' he would not think that the Word ceased to be,
   which is absurd, as has been said before, so also hearing of the Word
   which has been united to the flesh, let him understand the divine
   mystery one and simple. More clearly however and indisputably than all
   reasoning does what was said by the Archangel to the Bearer of God
   herself, shew the oneness of the Divine Word and Man. For he says, The
   Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the Power of the Highest shall
   overshadow thee: therefore also that Holy Thing which shall be born of
   thee, shall be called the Son of God [3417] .' Irrationally then do the
   followers of the Samosatene separate the Word who is clearly declared
   to be made one with the Man from Mary. He is not therefore sent through
   that Man; but He rather in Him sent, saying, Go ye, teach all nations
   [3418] .'

   33. And this is usual with Scripture [3419] , to express itself in
   inartificial and simple phrases. For so also in Numbers we shall find,
   Moses said to Raguel the Midianite, the father-in-law of Moses; for
   there was not one Moses who spoke, and another whose father-in-law was
   Raguel, but Moses was one. And if in like manner the Word of God is
   called Wisdom and Power and Right-Hand and Arm and the like, and if in
   His love to man He has become one with us, putting on our first-fruits
   and blended with it, therefore the other titles also have, as was
   natural, become the Word's portions. For that John has said, that in
   the beginning was the Word, and He with God and Himself God, and all
   things through Him, and without Him nothing made, shews clearly that
   even man is the formation of God the Word. If then after taking him,
   when enfeebled [3420] , into Himself, He renews him again through that
   sure renewal unto endless permanence, and therefore is made one with
   him in order to raise him to a diviner lot, how can we possibly say
   that the Word was sent through the Man who was from Mary, and reckon
   Him, the Lord of Apostles, with the other Apostles, I mean prophets,
   who were sent by Him? And how can Christ be called a mere man? on the
   contrary, being made one with the Word, He is with reason called Christ
   and Son of God, the prophet having long since loudly and clearly
   ascribed the Father's subsistence to Him, and said, And I will send My
   Son Christ [3421] ,' and in the Jordan, This is My Well-beloved Son.'
   For when He had fulfilled His promise, He shewed, as was suitable, that
   He was He whom He said He had sent.

   34. Let us then consider Christ in both ways, the divine Word made one
   in Mary with Him which is from Mary. For in her womb the Word fashioned
   for Himself His house, as at the beginning He formed Adam from the
   earth; or rather more divinely, concerning whom Solomon too says
   openly, knowing that the Word was also called Wisdom, Wisdom builded
   herself an house [3422] ;' which the Apostle interprets when he says,
   Which house are we [3423] ,' and elsewhere calls us a temple, as far as
   it is fitting to God to inhabit a temple, of which the image, made of
   stones, He by Solomon commanded the ancient people to build; whence, on
   the appearance of the Truth, the image ceased. For when the ruthless
   men wished to prove the image to be the truth, and to destroy that true
   habitation which we surely believe His union with us to be, He
   threatened them not; but knowing that their crime was against
   themselves, He says to them, Destroy this Temple, and in three days I
   will raise it up [3424] ,' He, our Saviour, surely shewing thereby that
   the things about which men busy themselves, carry their dissolution
   with them. For unless the Lord had built the house, and kept the city,
   in vain did the builders toil, and the keepers watch [3425] . And so
   the works of the Jews are undone, for they were a shadow; but the
   Church is firmly established; it is founded on the rock,' and the gates
   of hades shall not prevail against it [3426] .' Theirs [3427] it was to
   say, Why dost Thou, being a man, make Thyself God [3428] ?' and their
   disciple is the Samosatene; whence to his followers with reason does he
   teach his heresy. But we did not so learn Christ, if so be that we
   heard' Him, and were taught from Him, putting off the old man, which is
   corrupt according to the deceitful lusts,' and taking up the new, which
   after God is created in righteousness and true holiness [3429] .' Let
   Christ then in both ways be religiously considered.

   35. But if Scripture often calls even the body by the name of Christ,
   as in the blessed Peter's words to Cornelius, when he teaches him of
   Jesus of Nazareth, whom God anointed with the Holy Ghost,' and again to
   the Jews, Jesus of Nazareth, a Man approved of God for you [3430] ,'
   and again the blessed Paul to the Athenians, By that Man, whom He
   ordained, giving assurance to all men, in that He raised Him from the
   dead [3431] ' (for we find the appointment and the mission often
   synonymous with the anointing; from which any one who will may learn,
   that there is no discordance in the words of the sacred writers, but
   that they but give various names to the union of God the Word with the
   Man from Mary, sometimes as anointing, sometimes as mission, sometimes
   as appointment), it follows that what the blessed Peter says is right
   [3432] , and he proclaims in purity the Godhead of the Only begotten,
   without separating the subsistence of God the Word from the Man from
   Mary (perish the thought! for how should he, who had heard in so many
   ways, I and the Father are one,' and He that hath seen Me, hath seen
   the Father [3433] ?)' In which Man, after the resurrection also, when
   the doors were shut, we know of His coming to the whole band [3434] of
   the Apostles, and dispersing all that was hard to believe in it by His
   words, Handle Me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye
   see Me have [3435] .' And He did not say, This,' or this Man which I
   have taken to Me,' but Me.' Wherefore the Samosatene will gain no
   allowance, being refuted by so many arguments for the union of God the
   Word, nay by God the Word Himself, who now brings the news to all, and
   assures them by eating, and permitting to them that handling of Him
   which then took place. For certainly he who gives food to others, and
   they who give him, touch hands. For they gave Him,' Scripture says, a
   piece of a broiled fish and of an honey-comb, and' when He had eaten
   before them, He took the remains and gave to them [3436] .' See now,
   though not as Thomas was allowed, yet by another way, He afforded to
   them full assurance, in being touched by them; but if you would now see
   the scars, learn from Thomas. Reach hither thy hand and thrust it into
   My side, and reach hither thy finger and behold My hands [3437] ;' so
   says God the Word, speaking of His own [3438] side and hands, and of
   Himself as whole man and God together, first affording to the Saints
   even perception of the Word through the body [3439] , as we may
   consider, by entering when the doors were shut; and next standing near
   them in the body and affording full assurance. So much may be
   conveniently said for confirmation of the faithful, and correction of
   the unbelieving.

   36. And so let Paul of Samosata also stand corrected on hearing the
   divine voice of Him who said My body,' not Christ besides Me who am the
   Word,' but Him [3440] with Me, and Me with Him.' For I the Word am the
   chrism, and that which has the chrism from Me is the Man [3441] ; not
   then without Me could He be called Christ, but being with Me and I in
   Him. Therefore the mention of the mission of the Word shews the uniting
   which took place with Jesus, born of Mary, Whose Name means Saviour,
   not by reason of anything else, but from the Man's being made one with
   God the Word. This passage has the same meaning as the Father that sent
   Me,' and I came not of Myself, but the Father sent Me [3442] .' For he
   has given the name of mission [3443] to the uniting with the Man, with
   Whom the Invisible nature might be known to men, through the visible.
   For God changes not place, like us who are hidden in places, when in
   the fashion of our littleness He displays Himself in His existence in
   the flesh; for how should He, who fills the heaven and the earth? but
   on account of the presence in the flesh the just have spoken of His
   mission. Therefore God the Word Himself is Christ from Mary, God and
   Man; not some other Christ but One and the Same; He before ages from
   the Father, He too in the last times from the Virgin; invisible [3444]
   before even to the holy powers of heaven, visible now because of His
   being one with the Man who is visible; seen, I say, not in His
   invisible Godhead but in the operation [3445] of the Godhead through
   the human body and whole Man, which He has renewed by its appropriation
   to Himself. To Him be the adoration and the worship, who was before,
   and now is, and ever shall be, even to all ages. Amen.

   Introduction to de Synodis.

   ------------------------

   (Written 359, Added to After 361.)

   The de Synodis is the last of the great and important group of writings
   of the third exile. With the exception of Â§Â§30, 31, which were inserted
   at a later recension after the death of Constantius (cf. Hist. Ar. 32
   end), the work was all written in 359, the year of the dated' creed (Â§4
   apo tes nun hupateias) and of the fateful assemblies of Rimini and
   Seleucia. It was written moreover after the latter council had broken
   up (Oct. 1), but before the news had reached Athanasius of the
   Emperor's chilling reception of the Ariminian deputies, and of the
   protest of the bishops against their long detention at that place. The
   documents connected with the last named episode reached him only in
   time for his postscript (Â§55). Still less had he heard of the
   melancholy surrender of the deputies of Ariminum at NikÃ© on Oct. 10, or
   of the final catastrophe (cf. the allusion in the inserted Â§30, also
   Prolegg. ch. ii. Â§8 (2) fin.).

   The first part only (see Table infra) of the letter is devoted to the
   history [3446] of the twin councils. Athanasius is probably mistaken in
   ascribing the movement for a great council to the Acacian or Homoean
   anxiety to eclipse and finally set aside the Council of NicÃ¦a. The
   Semi-Arians, who were ill at ease and anxious to dissociate themselves
   from the growing danger of Anomoeanism, and who at this time had the
   ear of Constantius, were the persons who desired a doctrinal
   settlement. It was the last effort of Eastern Conservatism' (yet see
   Gwatkin, Studies, p. 163) to formulate a position which without
   admitting the obnoxious homoousion should yet condemn Arianism,
   conciliate the West, and restore peace to the Christian world. The
   failure of the attempt, gloomy and ignominious as it was, was yet the
   beginning of the end, the necessary precursor of the downfall of
   Arianism as a power within the Church. The cause of this failure is to
   be found in the intrigues of the Homoeans, Valens in the West, Eudoxius
   and Acacius in the East. NicÃ¦a was chosen by Constantius for the venue
   of the great Synod. But Basil, then in high favour, suggested
   Nicomedia, and thither the bishops were summoned. Before they could
   meet, the city was destroyed by an earthquake, and the venue was
   changed to NicÃ¦a again. Now the Homoeans saw their opportunity. Their
   one chance of escaping disaster was in the principle divide et impera.'
   The Council was divided into two: the Westerns were to meet at
   Ariminum, the Easterns at Seleucia in Cilicia, a place with nothing to
   recommend it excepting the presence of a strong military force. Hence
   also the conference of Homoean and Semi-Arian bishops at Sirmium, who
   drew up in the presence of Constantius, on Whitsun-Eve, the famous
   dated' or third Sirmian' Creed. Its wording (homoiou kata panta) shows
   the predominant influence of the Semi-Arians, in spite of the efforts
   of Valens to get rid of the test words, upon which the Emperor
   insisted. Basil moreover issued a separate memorandum to explain the
   sense in which he signed the creed, emphasising the absolute likeness
   of the Son to the Father (Bright, Introd., lxxxiii., Gwatkin, pp. 168
   sq.), and accepting the Nicene doctrine in everything but the name. But
   for all Basil might say, the Dated Creed by the use of the word homoion
   had opened the door to any evasion that an Arian could desire: for
   homoion is a relative term admitting of degrees: what is only like' is
   ipso facto to some extent unlike (see below, Â§53). The party of Basil,
   then, entered upon the decisive contest already outmanoeuvred, and
   doomed to failure. The events which followed are described by
   Athanasius (Â§Â§8-12). At Ariminum the Nicene, at Seleucia the Semi-Arian
   cause carried all before it. The Dated Creed, rejected with scorn at
   Ariminum, was unsuccessfully propounded in an altered form by Acacius
   at Seleucia. The rupture between Homoeans and Semi-Arians was complete.
   So far only does Athanasius carry his account of the Synods: at this
   point he steps in with a fresh blow at the link which united Eastern
   Conservatism with the mixed multitude of original Arians like Euzoius
   and Valens, ultra Arians like Aetius and Eunomius, and Arianising
   opportunists like Acacius, Eudoxius, and their tribe. In the latter he
   recognises deadly foes who are to be confuted and exposed without any
   thought of compromise; in the former, brethren who misunderstand their
   own position, and whom explanation will surely bring round to their
   natural allies. In this twofold aim the de Synodis stands in the lines
   of the great anti-Arian discourses (supra, p. 304). But with the eye of
   a general Athanasius suits his attack to the new position. With the
   Arians, he has done with theological argument; he points indignantly to
   their intrigues and their brow-beating, to their lack of consistent
   principle, their endless synods and formularies (Â§Â§21-32); concisely he
   exposes the hollowness of their objection to the Nicene formula, the
   real logical basis upon which their position rests (Â§33-40, see Bright,
   xc.-xcii.). But to the Semi-Arians he turns with a serious and
   carefully stated vindication of the homoousion. The time has come to
   press it earnestly upon them as the only adequate expression of what
   they really mean, as the only rampart which can withstand the Arian
   invasion. This, the last portion (Â§Â§41-54) of the letter, is the raison
   d'Ãªtre of the whole: the account of the Synods is merely a means to
   this end, not his main purpose; the exposure of Arian principles and of
   Arian variations subserves the ultimate aim of detaching from them
   those of whom Athanasius was now hoping better things. It may be said
   that he over-rated the hopefulness of affairs as far as the immediate
   future was concerned. The weak acceptance by the Seleucian majority (or
   rather by their delegates) of the Arian creed of NikÃ©, the triumph of
   Acacius, Eudoxius and their party as Constantius drifted in the last
   two years of his life nearer and nearer to ultra-Arianism (de Syn. 30,
   31, his rupture with Basil, Theodt. ii. 27), the ascendancy of Arianism
   under Valens, and the eventual consolidation of a Semi-Arian sect under
   the name of Macedonius, all this at the first glance is a sad
   commentary upon the hopefulness of the de Synodis. But (1) even if this
   were all the truth, Athanasius was right: he was acting a noble part.
   In the de Synodis even Athanasius rises above himself.' Driven to bay
   by the pertinacity of his enemies, exasperated as we see him in the de
   Fuga and Arian History, yet no sooner is he cheered with the news of
   hope than the importunate jealousies of forty years are hushed
   (contrast Ep. Ã†g. 7) in a moment, as though the Lord had spoken peace
   to the tumult of the grey old exile's troubled soul' (Gwatkin, Studies,
   p. 176, Arian Controv., p. 98). The charity that hopeth all things is
   always justified of her works. (2) Athanasius, however, was right in
   his estimate of the position. Not only did many of the Semi-Arians
   (e.g. the fifty-nine in 365) accept the homoousion, but it was from the
   ranks of the Semi-Arians that the men arose who led the cause of NicÃ¦a
   to its ultimate victory in the East. There accompanied Basil of Ancyra
   from the Seleucian Synod to Constantinople a young deacon and ascetic,
   who read and welcomed the appeal of Athanasius. Writing a few months
   later, this young theologian, Basil of CÃ¦sarea, adopts the words of the
   de Synodis: one God we confess, one in nature not in number, for number
   belongs to the category of quantity,...neither Like nor Unlike, for
   these terms belong to the category of quality (cf. below, Â§53)...He
   that is essentially God is Coessential with Him that is essentially
   God....If I am to state my own opinion, I accept "Like in essence" with
   the addition of "exactly" as identical in sense with
   "Coessential"...but "exactly like" [without "essence"] I
   suspect....Accordingly since "Coessential" is the term less open to
   abuse, on this ground I too adopt it' (Epp. 8, 9, the Greek in Gwatkin,
   Studies, p. 242) [3447] . Basil the Great is, not indeed the only, but
   the conspicuous and abundant justification of the insight of Athanasius
   in the de Synodis.

   Turning to subordinate parts of the Letter, we may note the somewhat
   unfair use made of the unlucky blunder of the Dated Creed, as though
   its compilers thereby admitted that their faith had no earlier origin.
   The dating of the creed was doubtless an offence against good taste as
   well as ecclesiastical propriety' (as sad a blunder in its way as
   Macaulay's celebrated letter to his constituents from Windsor Castle'),
   and it was only in human nature to make the most of it. More serious is
   the objection taken to the revolting title Augoustou tou aioniou (which
   set a bad precedent for later times, Bright, lxxxiv, note 4) in
   contrast to the denial of the eternity of the Son. At any rate, lending
   itself as it did to such obvious criticisms, we are not surprised to
   read (Â§29) that the copies of the creed were hastily called in and a
   fresh recension substituted for it.

   Lastly it must be remembered that Athanasius does not aim at giving a
   complete catalogue of Arian or Arianising creeds, any more than at
   giving a full history of the double council. Accordingly we miss (1)
   the confession of Arius and Euzoius, presented to Constantine in 330;
   (2) The confession colourless in wording, but heterodox in aim,' drawn
   up at Sirmium [3448] against Photinus in 347 (Hil. Fragm. 2. 21 sq.
   Hefele, vol. i. p. 192); (3) The formulary propounded by the Emperor at
   Milan in 355 (Hil. Syn. 78); (4) The confession of the council of
   Ancyra [3449] , 358, alluded to Â§41, see n. 9); (5) The Anomoean
   Ecthesis of Eudoxius and Aetius, Constantinople 359 (Thdt. H. E. ii.
   27).

   In the de Synodis we have a worthy conclusion of the anti-Arian
   writings which are the legacy and the record of the most stirring and
   eventful period of the noble life of our great bishop.

   The translation of this tract by Newman has been more closely revised
   than those of the de Decretis' and the first three Discourses,' as it
   appeared somewhat less exact in places. In Â§Â§10, 11, the Athanasian
   version has been followed, as, inaccurate as the version certainly is
   in places, this seemed more suitable to an edition of Athanasius;
   moreover, it appears to preserve some more original readings than the
   Hilarian text. The notes have been curtailed to some extent, especially
   those containing purely historical matter.

   Councils of Ariminum and Seleucia.

   ------------------------

   Part I. History of the Councils.

   Reason why two Councils were called. Inconsistency and folly of calling
   any; and of the style of the Arian formularies; occasion of the Nicene
   Council; proceedings at Ariminum; Letter of the Council to Constantius;
   its decree. Proceedings at Seleucia; reflections on the conduct of the
   Arians.

   1. Perhaps news has reached even yourselves concerning the Council,
   which is at this time the subject of general conversation; for letters
   both from the Emperor and the Prefects [3450] were circulated far and
   wide for its convocation. However, you take that interest in the events
   which have occurred, that I have determined upon giving you an account
   of what I have seen myself, and accurately ascertained, which may save
   you from the suspense attendant on the reports of others; and this the
   more, because there are parties who are in the habit of misrepresenting
   what has happened. At NicÃ¦a then, which had been fixed upon, the
   Council has not met, but a second edict was issued, convening the
   Western Bishops at Ariminum in Italy, and the Eastern at Seleucia the
   Rugged, as it is called, in Isauria. The professed reason of such a
   meeting was to treat of the faith touching our Lord Jesus Christ; and
   those who alleged it, were Ursacius, Valens, and one Germinius [3451]
   from Pannonia; and from Syria, Acacius, Eudoxius, and Patrophilus
   [3452] of Scythopolis. These men who had always been of the Arian
   party, and understood neither how they believe or whereof they affirm,'
   and were silently deceiving first one and then another, and scattering
   the second sowing [3453] of their heresy, influenced some who seemed to
   be somewhat, and the Emperor Constantius among them, being a heretic
   [3454] , on some pretence about the Faith, to call a Council; under the
   idea that they should be able to put into the shade the Nicene Council,
   and prevail upon all to turn round, and to establish irreligion
   everywhere instead of the Truth.

   2. Now here I marvel first, and think that I shall carry every sensible
   man whatever with me, that, whereas a General Council had been fixed,
   and all were looking forward to it, it was all of a sudden divided into
   two, so that one part met here, and the other there. However, this was
   surely the doing of Providence, in order in the respective Councils to
   exhibit the faith without guile or corruption of the one party, and to
   expose the dishonesty and duplicity of the other. Next, this too was on
   the mind of myself and my true brethren here, and made us anxious, the
   impropriety of this great gathering which we saw in progress; for what
   pressed so much, that the whole world was to be put in confusion, and
   those who at the time bore the profession of clergy, should run about
   far and near, seeking how best to learn to believe in our Lord Jesus
   Christ? Certainly if they were believers already, they would not have
   been seeking, as though they were not. And to the catechumens, this was
   no small scandal; but to the heathen, it was something more than
   common, and even furnished broad merriment [3455] , that Christians, as
   if waking out of sleep at this time of day, should be enquiring how
   they were to believe concerning Christ; while their professed clergy,
   though claiming deference from their flocks, as teachers, were
   unbelievers on their own shewing, in that they were seeking what they
   had not. And the party of Ursacius, who were at the bottom of all this,
   did not understand what wrath they were storing up (Rom. ii. 5) against
   themselves, as our Lord says by His saints, Woe unto them, through whom
   My Name is blasphemed among the Gentiles' (Is. lii. 5; Rom. ii. 24);
   and by His own mouth in the Gospels (Matt. xviii. 6), Whoso shall
   offend one of these little ones, it were better for him that a
   millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the
   depth of the sea, than,' as Luke adds, that he should offend one of
   these little ones' (Luke xvii. 2).

   3. What defect of teaching was there for religious truth in the
   Catholic Church [3456] , that they should enquire concerning faith now,
   and should prefix this year's Consulate to their profession of faith?
   For Ursacius and Valens and Germinius and their friends have done what
   never took place, never was heard of among Christians. After putting
   into writing what it pleased them to believe, they prefix to it the
   Consulate, and the month and the day of the current year [3457] ;
   thereby to shew all sensible men, that their faith dates, not from of
   old, but now, from the reign of Constantius [3458] ; for whatever they
   write has a view to their own heresy. Moreover, though pretending to
   write about the Lord, they nominate another master for themselves,
   Constantius, who has bestowed on them this reign of irreligion [3459] ;
   and they who deny that the Son is everlasting, have called him Eternal
   Emperor; such foes of Christ are they in addition to irreligion. But
   perhaps the dates in the holy Prophets form their excuse for the
   Consulate; so bold a pretence, however, will serve but to publish more
   fully their ignorance of the subject. For the prophecies of the saints
   do indeed specify their times (for instance, Isaiah and Hosea lived in
   the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah; Jeremiah in the days of
   Josiah; Ezekiel and Daniel prophesied under Cyrus and Darius; and
   others in other times); yet they were not laying the foundations of
   divine religion; it was before them, and was always, for before the
   foundation of the world God prepared it for us in Christ. Nor were they
   signifying the respective dates of their own faith; for they had been
   believers before these dates. But the dates did but belong to their own
   preaching. And this preaching spoke beforehand of the Saviour's coming,
   but directly of what was to happen to Israel and the nations; and the
   dates denoted not the commencement of faith, as I said before, but of
   the prophets themselves, that is, when it was they thus prophesied. But
   our modern sages, not in historical narration, nor in prediction of the
   future, but, after writing, The Catholic Faith was published,'
   immediately add the Consulate and the month and the day, that, as the
   saints specified the dates of their histories, and of their own
   ministries, so these may mark the date of their own faith. And would
   that they had written, touching their own [3460] ' (for it does date
   from today); and had not made their essay as touching the Catholic,'
   for they did not write, Thus we believe,' but the Catholic Faith was
   published.'

   4. The boldness then of their design shews how little they understand
   the subject; while the novelty of their phrase matches the Arian
   heresy. For thus they shew, when it was they began their own faith, and
   that from that same time present they would have it proclaimed. And as
   according to the Evangelist Luke, there was made a decree' (Luke ii. 1)
   concerning the taxing, and this decree before was not, but began from
   those days in which it was made by its framer, they also in like
   manner, by writing, The Faith is now published,' shewed that the
   sentiments of their heresy are novel, and were not before. But if they
   add of the Catholic Faith,' they fall before they know it into the
   extravagance of the Phrygians, and say with them, To us first was
   revealed,' and from us dates the Faith of Christians.' And as those
   inscribe it with the names of Maximilla and Montanus [3461] , so do
   these with Constantius, Master,' instead of Christ. If, however, as
   they would have it, the faith dates from the present Consulate, what
   will the Fathers do, and the blessed Martyrs? nay, what will they
   themselves do with their own catechumens, who departed to rest before
   this Consulate? how will they wake them up, that so they may obliterate
   their former lessons, and may sow in turn the seeming discoveries which
   they have now put into writing [3462] ? So ignorant they are on the
   subject; with no knowledge but that of making excuses, and those
   unbecoming and unplausible, and carrying with them their own
   refutation.

   5. As to the Nicene Council, it was not a common meeting, but convened
   upon a pressing necessity, and for a reasonable object. The Syrians,
   Cilicians, and Mesopotamians, were out of order in celebrating the
   Feast, and kept Easter with the Jews [3463] ; on the other hand, the
   Arian heresy had risen up against the Catholic Church, and found
   supporters in Eusebius and his fellows, who were both zealous for the
   heresy, and conducted the attack upon religious people. This gave
   occasion for an Ecumenical Council, that the feast might be everywhere
   celebrated on one day, and that the heresy which was springing up might
   be anathematized. It took place then; and the Syrians submitted, and
   the Fathers pronounced the Arian heresy to be the forerunner of
   Antichrist [3464] , and drew up a suitable formula against it. And yet
   in this, many as they are, they ventured on nothing like the
   proceedings [3465] of these three or four men [3466] . Without
   pre-fixing Consulate, month, and day, they wrote concerning Easter, It
   seemed good as follows,' for it did then seem good that there should be
   a general compliance; but about the faith they wrote not, It seemed
   good,' but, Thus believes the Catholic Church;' and thereupon they
   confessed how they believed, in order to shew that their own sentiments
   were not novel, but Apostolical; and what they wrote down was no
   discovery of theirs, but is the same as was taught by the Apostles.
   [3467]

   6. But the Councils which they are now setting in motion, what
   colourable pretext have they [3468] ? If any new heresy has risen since
   the Arian, let them tell us the positions which it has devised, and who
   are its inventors? and in their own formula, let them anathematize the
   heresies antecedent to this Council of theirs, among which is the
   Arian, as the Nicene Fathers did, that it may appear that they too have
   some cogent reason for saying what is novel. But if no such event has
   happened, and they have it not to shew, but rather they themselves are
   uttering heresies, as holding Arius's irreligion, and are exposed day
   by day, and day by day shift their ground [3469] , what need is there
   of Councils, when the Nicene is sufficient, as against the Arian
   heresy, so against the rest, which it has condemned one and all by
   means of the sound faith? For even the notorious Aetius, who was
   surnamed godless [3470] , vaunts not of the discovering of any mania of
   his own, but under stress of weather has been wrecked upon Arianism,
   himself and the persons whom he has beguiled. Vainly then do they run
   about with the pretext that they have demanded Councils for the faith's
   sake; for divine Scripture is sufficient above all things; but if a
   Council be needed on the point, there are the proceedings of the
   Fathers, for the Nicene Bishops did not neglect this matter, but stated
   the doctrine so exactly, that persons reading their words honestly,
   cannot but be reminded by them of the religion towards Christ announced
   in divine Scripture [3471] .

   7. Having therefore no reason on their side, but being in difficulty
   whichever way they turn, in spite of their pretences, they have nothing
   left but to say; Forasmuch as we contradict our predecessors, and
   transgress the traditions of the Fathers, therefore we have thought
   good that a Council should meet [3472] ; but again, whereas we fear
   lest, should it meet at one place, our pains will be thrown away,
   therefore we have thought good that it be divided into two; that so
   when we put forth our documents to these separate portions, we may
   overreach with more effect, with the threat of Constantius the patron
   of this irreligion, and may supersede the acts of NicÃ¦a, under pretence
   of the simplicity of our own documents.' If they have not put this into
   words, yet this is the meaning of their deeds and their disturbances.
   Certainly, many and frequent as have been their speeches and writings
   in various Councils, never yet have they made mention of the Arian
   heresy as objectionable; but, if any present happened to accuse the
   heresies, they always took up the defence of the Arian, which the
   Nicene Council had anathematized; nay, rather, they cordially welcomed
   the professors of Arianism. This then is in itself a strong argument,
   that the aim of the present Councils was not truth, but the annulling
   of the acts of NicÃ¦a; but the proceedings of them and their friends in
   the Councils themselves, make it equally clear that this was the
   case:--For now we must relate everything as it occurred.

   8. When all were in expectation that they were to assemble in one
   place, whom the Emperor's letters convoked, and to form one Council,
   they were divided into two; and, while some betook themselves to
   Seleucia called the Rugged, the others met at Ariminum, to the number
   of those four hundred bishops and more, among whom were Germinius,
   Auxentius, Valens, Ursacius, Demophilus, and Gaius [3473] . And, while
   the whole assembly was discussing the matter from the Divine
   Scriptures, these men produced [3474] a paper, and, reading out the
   Consulate, they demanded that it should be preferred to every Council,
   and that no questions should be put to the heretics beyond it, nor
   inquiry made into their meaning, but that it should be sufficient by
   itself;--and what they had written ran as follows:--

   The Catholic Faith [3475] was published in the presence of our Master
   the most religious and gloriously victorious Emperor, Constantius,
   Augustus, the eternal and august, in the Consulate of the most
   illustrious Flavii, Eusebius and Hypatius, in Sirmium on the 11th of
   the Calends of June [3476] .

   We believe in one Only and True God, the Father Almighty, Creator and
   Framer of all things:

   And in one Only-begotten Son of God, who, before all ages, and before
   all origin, and before all conceivable time, and before all
   comprehensible essence, was begotten impassibly from God: through whom
   the ages were disposed and all things were made; and Him begotten as
   the Only-begotten, Only from the Only Father, God from God, like to the
   Father who begat Him, according to the Scriptures; whose origin no one
   knoweth save the Father alone who begat Him. We know that He, the
   Only-begotten Son of God, at the Father's bidding came from the heavens
   for the abolishment of sin, and was born of the Virgin Mary, and
   conversed with the disciples, and fulfilled the Economy according to
   the Father's will, and was crucified, and died and descended into the
   parts beneath the earth, and regulated the things there, Whom the
   gate-keepers of hell saw (Job xxxviii. 17, LXX.) and shuddered; and He
   rose from the dead the third day, and conversed with the disciples, and
   fulfilled all the Economy, and when the forty days were full, ascended
   into the heavens, and sitteth on the right hand of the Father, and is
   coming in the last day of the resurrection in the glory of the Father,
   to render to every one according to his works.

   And in the Holy Ghost, whom the Only-begotten of God Himself, Jesus
   Christ, had promised to send to the race of men, the Paraclete, as it
   is written, I go to My Father, and I will ask the Father, and He shall
   send unto you another Paraclete, even the Spirit of Truth. He shall
   take of Mine and shall teach and bring to your remembrance all things'
   (Job. xiv. 16, 17, 26; xvi. 14).

   But whereas the term essence,' has been adopted by the Fathers in
   simplicity, and gives offence as being misconceived by the people, and
   is not contained in the Scriptures, it has seemed good to remove it,
   that it be never in any case used of God again, because the divine
   Scriptures nowhere use it of Father and Son. But we say that the Son is
   like the Father in all things, as also the Holy Scriptures say and
   teach [3477] .

   9. When this had been read, the dishonesty of its framers was soon
   apparent. For on the Bishops proposing that the Arian heresy should be
   anathematized together with the other heresies too, and all assenting,
   Ursacius and Valens and those with them refused; till in the event the
   Fathers condemned them, on the ground that their confession had been
   written, not in sincerity, but for the annulling of the acts of NicÃ¦a,
   and the introduction instead of their unhappy heresy. Marvelling then
   at the deceitfulness of their language and their unprincipled
   intentions, the Bishops said: Not as if in need of faith have we come
   hither; for we have within us faith, and that in soundness: but that we
   may put to shame those who gainsay the truth and attempt novelties. If
   then ye have drawn up this formula, as if now beginning to believe, ye
   are not so much as clergy, but are starting with school; but if you
   meet us with the same views with which we have come hither, let there
   be a general unanimity, and let us anathematize the heresies, and
   preserve the teaching of the Fathers. Thus pleas for Councils will not
   longer circulate about, the Bishops at NicÃ¦a having anticipated them
   once for all, and done all that was needful for the Catholic Church
   [3478] .' However, even then, in spite of this general agreement of the
   Bishops, still the above-mentioned refused. So at length the whole
   Council, condemning them as ignorant and deceitful men, or rather as
   heretics, gave their suffrages in behalf of the Nicene Council, and
   gave judgment all of them that it was enough; but as to the forenamed
   Ursacius and Valens, Germinius, Auxentius, Gaius, and Demophilus, they
   pronounced them to be heretics, deposed them as not really Christians,
   but Arians, and wrote against them in Latin what has been translated in
   its substance into Greek, thus:--

   10. Copy of an Epistle from the Council to Constantius Augustus [3479]
   .

   We believe that what was formerly decreed was brought about both by
   God's command and by order of your piety. For we the bishops, from all
   the Western cities, assembled together at Ariminum, both that the Faith
   of the Catholic Church might be made known, and that gainsayers might
   be detected. For, as we have found after long deliberation, it appeared
   desirable to adhere to and maintain to the end, that faith which,
   enduring from antiquity, we have received as preached by the prophets,
   the Gospels, and the Apostles through our Lord Jesus Christ, Who is
   Keeper of your Kingdom and Patron of your power. For it appeared wrong
   and unlawful to make any change in what was rightly and justly defined,
   and what was resolved upon in common at NicÃ¦a along with the Emperor
   your father, the most glorious Constantine,--the doctrine and spirit of
   which [definition] went abroad and was proclaimed in the hearing and
   understanding of all men. For it alone was the conqueror and destroyer
   of the heresy of Arius, by which not that only but the other heresies
   [3480] also were destroyed, to which of a truth it is perilous to add,
   and full of danger to minish aught from it, since if either be done,
   our enemies will be able with impunity to do whatever they will.
   Accordingly Ursacius and Valens, since they had been from of old
   abettors and sympathisers of the Arian dogma, were properly declared
   separate from our communion, to be admitted to which they asked to be
   allowed a place of repentance and pardon for the transgressions of
   which they were conscious, as the documents drawn up by them testify.
   By which means forgiveness and pardon on all charges has been obtained.
   Now the time of these transactions was when the council was assembled
   at Milan [3481] , the presbyters of the Roman Church being also
   present. But knowing at the same time that Constantine of worthy memory
   had with all accuracy and deliberation published the Faith then drawn
   up; when he had been baptized by the hands of men, and had departed to
   the place which was his due, [we think it] unseemly to make a
   subsequent innovation and to despise so many saints, confessors,
   martyrs, who compiled and drew up this decree; who moreover have
   continued to hold in all matters according to the ancient law of the
   Church; whose faith God has imparted even to the times of your reign
   through our Master Jesus Christ, through whom also it is yours to reign
   and rule over the world in our day [3482] . Once more then the pitiful
   men of wretched mind with lawless daring have announced themselves as
   the heralds of an impious opinion, and are attempting to upset every
   summary of truth. For when according to your command the synod met,
   those men laid bare the design of their own deceitfulness. For they
   attempted in a certain unscrupulous and disorderly manner to propose to
   us an innovation, having found as accomplices in this plot Germinius,
   Auxentius [3483] , and Gaius, the stirrers up of strife and discord,
   whose teaching by itself has gone beyond every pitch of blasphemy. But
   when they perceived that we did not share their purpose, nor agree with
   their evil mind, they transferred themselves to our council, alleging
   that it might be advisable to compile something instead. But a short
   time was enough to expose their plans. And lest the Churches should
   have a recurrence of these disturbances, and a whirl of discord and
   confusion throw everything into disorder, it seemed good to keep
   undisturbed the ancient and reasonable institutions, and that the above
   persons should be separated from our communion. For the information
   therefore of your clemency, we have instructed our legates to acquaint
   you with the judgment of the Council by our letter, to whom we have
   given this special direction, to establish the truth by resting their
   case upon the ancient and just decrees; and they will also assure your
   piety that peace would not be accomplished by the removal of those
   decrees as Valens and Ursacius alleged. For how is it possible for
   peace-breakers to bring peace? on the contrary, by their means strife
   and confusion will arise not only in the other cities, but also in the
   Church of the Romans. On this account we ask your clemency to regard
   our legates with favourable ears and a serene countenance and not to
   suffer aught to be abrogated to the dishonour of the dead; but allow us
   to abide by what has been defined and laid down by our forefathers,
   who, we venture to say, we trust in all things acted with prudence and
   wisdom and the Holy Spirit; because by these novelties not only are the
   faithful made to disbelieve, but the infidels also are embittered
   [3484] . We pray also that you would give orders that so many Bishops
   who are detained abroad, among whom are numbers who are broken with age
   and poverty, may be enabled to return to their own country, lest the
   Churches suffer, as being deprived of their Bishops. This, however, we
   ask with earnestness, that nothing be innovated upon existing creeds,
   nothing withdrawn; but that all remain incorrupt which has continued in
   the times of your Father's piety and to the present time; and that you
   will not permit us to be harassed, and estranged from our sees; but
   that the Bishops may in quiet give themselves always to prayers and
   worship, which they do always offer for your own safety and for your
   reign, and for peace, which may the Divinity bestow on you for ever.
   But our legates are conveying the subscriptions and titles of the
   Bishops, and will also inform your piety from the Holy Scriptures
   themselves.

   11. Decree of the Council [3485] .

   As far as it was fitting and possible, dearest brethren, the general
   Council and the holy Church have had patience, and have generously
   displayed the Church's forbearance towards Ursacius and Valens, Gaius,
   Germinius, and Auxentius; who by so often changing what they had
   believed, have troubled all the Churches, and still are endeavouring to
   foist their heretical spirit upon the faith of the orthodox. For they
   wish to annul the formulary passed at NicÃ¦a, which was framed against
   the Arian heresy. They have presented to us besides a creed drawn up by
   themselves from without, and utterly alien to the most holy Church;
   which we could not lawfully receive. Even before this, and now, have
   they been pronounced heretics and gainsayers by us, whom we have not
   admitted to our communion, but condemned and deposed them in their
   presence by our voices. Now then, what seems good to you, again
   declare, that each one's vote may be ratified by his subscription.

   The Bishops answered with one accord, It seems good that the aforenamed
   heretics should be condemned, that the Catholic faith may remain in
   peace.

   Matters at Ariminum then had this speedy issue; for there was no
   disagreement there, but all of them with one accord both put into
   writing what they decided upon, and deposed the Arians [3486] .

   12. Meanwhile the transactions in Seleucia the Rugged were as follows:
   it was in the month called by the Romans September, by the Egyptians
   Thoth, and by the Macedonians GorpiÃ¦us, and the day of the month
   according to the Egyptians the 16th [3487] , upon which all the members
   of the Council assembled together. And there were present about a
   hundred and sixty; and whereas there were many who were accused among
   them, and their accusers were crying out against them, Acacius, and
   Patrophilus, and Uranius of Tyre, and Eudoxius, who usurped the Church
   of Antioch, and Leontius [3488] , and Theodotus [3489] , and Evagrius,
   and Theodulus, and George who has been driven from the whole world
   [3490] , adopt an unprincipled course. Fearing the proofs which their
   accusers had to shew against them, they coalesced with the rest of the
   Arian party (who were mercenaries in the cause of irreligion for this
   purpose, and were ordained by Secundus, who had been deposed by the
   great Council), the Libyan Stephen, and Seras, and Polydeuces, who were
   under accusation upon various charges, next Pancratius, and one Ptolemy
   a Meletian [3491] . And they made a pretence [3492] of entering upon
   the question of faith, but it was clear they were doing so from fear of
   their accusers; and they took the part of the heresy, till at length
   they were divided among themselves. For, whereas those with Acacius and
   his fellows lay under suspicion and were very few, the others were the
   majority; therefore Acacius and his fellows, acting with the boldness
   of desperation, altogether denied the Nicene formula, and censured the
   Council, while the others, who were the majority, accepted the whole
   proceedings of the Council, except that they complained of the word
   Coessential,' as obscure and so open to suspicion. When then time
   passed, and the accusers pressed, and the accused put in pleas, and
   thereby were led on further by their irreligion and blasphemed the
   Lord, thereupon the majority of Bishops became indignant [3493] , and
   deposed Acacius, Patrophilus, Uranius, Eudoxius, and George the
   contractor [3494] , and others from Asia, Leontius, and Theodosius,
   Evagrius and Theodulus, and excommunicated Asterius, Eusebius, Augarus,
   Basilicus, Phoebus, Fidelius, Eutychius, and Magnus. And this they did
   on their non-appearance, when summoned to defend themselves on charges
   which numbers preferred against them. And they decreed that so they
   should remain, until they made their defence and cleared themselves of
   the offences imputed to them. And after despatching the sentence
   pronounced against them to the diocese of each, they proceeded to
   Constantius, the most irreligious [3495] Augustus, to report to him
   their proceedings, as they had been ordered. And this was the
   termination of the Council in Seleucia.

   13. Who then but must approve of the conscientious conduct of the
   Bishops at Ariminum? who endured such labour of journey and perils of
   sea, that by a sacred and canonical resolution they might depose the
   Arians, and guard inviolate the definitions of the Fathers. For each of
   them deemed that, if they undid the acts of their predecessors, they
   were affording a pretext to their successors to undo what they
   themselves then were enacting [3496] . And who but must condemn the
   fickleness of Eudoxius, Acacius, and their fellows, who sacrifice the
   honour due to their own fathers to partizanship and patronage of the
   Ario-maniacs [3497] ? for what confidence can be placed in their acts,
   if the acts of their fathers be undone? or how call they them fathers
   and themselves successors, if they set about impeaching their judgment?
   and especially what can Acacius say of his own master, Eusebius, who
   not only gave his subscription in the Nicene Council, but even in a
   letter [3498] signified to his flock, that that was true faith, which
   the Council had declared? for, if he explained himself in that letter
   in his own way [3499] , yet he did not contradict the Council's terms,
   but even charged it upon the Arians, that their position that the Son
   was not before His generation, was not even consistent with His being
   before Mary. What then will they proceed to teach the people who are
   under their teaching? that the Fathers erred? and how are they
   themselves to be trusted by those, whom they teach to disobey their
   Teachers? and with what eyes too will they look upon the sepulchres of
   the Fathers whom they now name heretics? And why do they defame the
   Valentinians, Phrygians, and Manichees, yet give the name of saint to
   those whom they themselves suspect of making parallel statements? or
   how can they any longer be Bishops, if they were ordained by persons
   whom they accuse of heresy [3500] ? But if their sentiments were wrong
   and their writings seduced the world, then let their memory perish
   altogether; when, however, you cast out their books, go and cast out
   their remains too from the cemeteries, so that one and all may know
   that they are seducers, and that you are parricides.

   14. The blessed Apostle approves of the Corinthians because, he says,
   ye remember me in all things, and keep the traditions as I delivered
   them to you' (1 Cor. xi. 2); but they, as entertaining such views of
   their predecessors, will have the daring to say just the reverse to
   their flocks: We praise you not for remembering your fathers, but
   rather we make much of you, when you hold not their traditions.' And
   let them go on to accuse their own unfortunate birth, and say, We are
   sprung not of religious men but of heretics.' For such language, as I
   said before, is consistent in those who barter their Fathers' fame and
   their own salvation for Arianism, and fear not the words of the divine
   proverb, There is a generation that curseth their father' (Prov. xxx.
   11; Ex. xxi. 17), and the threat lying in the Law against such. They
   then, from zeal for the heresy, are of this obstinate temper; you,
   however, be not troubled at it, nor take their audacity for truth. For
   they dissent from each other, and, whereas they have revolted from
   their Fathers, are not of one and the same mind, but float about with
   various and discordant changes. And, as quarrelling with the Council of
   NicÃ¦a, they have held many Councils themselves, and have published a
   faith in each of them, and have stood to none [3501] , nay, they will
   never do otherwise, for perversely seeking, they will never find that
   Wisdom which they hate. I have accordingly subjoined portions both of
   Arius's writings and of whatever else I could collect, of their
   publications in different Councils; whereby you will learn to your
   surprise with what object they stand out against an Ecumenical Council
   and their own Fathers without blushing.

   their Fathers,' &c.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Part II. History of Arian Opinions.

   Arius's own sentiments; his Thalia and Letter to S. Alexander;
   corrections by Eusebius and others; extracts from the works of
   Asterius; letter of the Council of Jerusalem; first Creed of Arians at
   the Dedication of Antioch; second, Lucian's on the same occasion;
   third, by Theophronius; fourth, sent to Constans in Gaul; fifth, the
   Macrostich sent into Italy; sixth, at Sirmium; seventh, at the same
   place; and eighth also, as given above in Â§8; ninth, at Seleucia;
   tenth, at Constantinople; eleventh, at Antioch.

   15. Arius and those with him thought and professed thus: God made the
   Son out of nothing, and called Him His Son;' The Word of God is one of
   the creatures;' and Once He was not;' and He is alterable; capable,
   when it is His Will, of altering.' Accordingly they were expelled from
   the Church by the blessed Alexander. However, after his expulsion, when
   he was with Eusebius and his fellows, he drew up his heresy upon paper,
   and imitating in the Thalia no grave writer, but the Egyptian Sotades,
   in the dissolute tone of his metre [3502] , he writes at great length,
   for instance as follows:--

   Blasphemies of Arius.

   God Himself then, in His own nature, is ineffable by all men. Equal or
   like Himself He alone has none, or one in glory. And Ingenerate we call
   Him, because of Him who is generate by nature. We praise Him as without
   beginning because of Him who has a beginning. And adore Him as
   everlasting, because of Him who in time has come to be. The Unbegun
   made the Son a beginning of things originated; and advanced Him as a
   Son to Himself by adoption. He has nothing proper to God in proper
   subsistence. For He is not equal, no, nor one in essence [3503] with
   Him. Wise is God, for He is the teacher of Wisdom [3504] . There is
   full proof that God is invisible to all beings; both to things which
   are through the Son, and to the Son He is invisible. I will say it
   expressly, how by the Son is seen the Invisible; by that power by which
   God sees, and in His own measure, the Son endures to see the Father, as
   is lawful. Thus there is a Triad, not in equal glories. Not
   intermingling with each other [3505] are their subsistences. One more
   glorious than the other in their glories unto immensity. Foreign from
   the Son in essence is the Father, for He is without beginning.
   Understand that the Monad was; but the Dyad was not, before it was in
   existence. It follows at once that, though the Son was not, the Father
   was God. Hence the Son, not being (for He existed at the will of the
   Father), is God Only-begotten [3506] , and He is alien from either.
   Wisdom existed as Wisdom by the will of the Wise God. Hence He is
   conceived in numberless conceptions [3507] : Spirit, Power, Wisdom,
   God's glory, Truth, Image, and Word. Understand that He is conceived to
   be Radiance and Light. One equal to the Son, the Superior is able to
   beget; but one more excellent, or superior, or greater, He is not able.
   At God's will the Son is what and whatsoever He is. And when and since
   He was, from that time He has subsisted from God. He, being a strong
   God, praises in His degree the Superior. To speak in brief, God is
   ineffable to His Son. For He is to Himself what He is, that is,
   unspeakable. So that nothing which is called comprehensible [3508] does
   the Son know to speak about; for it is impossible for Him to
   investigate the Father, who is by Himself. For the Son does not know
   His own essence, For, being Son, He really existed, at the will of the
   Father. What argument then allows, that He who is from the Father
   should know His own parent by comprehension? For it is plain that for
   that which hath a beginning to conceive how the Unbegun is, or to grasp
   the idea, is not possible.

   16. And what they wrote by letter to the blessed Alexander, the Bishop,
   runs as follows:--

   To Our Blessed Pope [3509] and Bishop, Alexander, the Presbyters and
   Deacons send health in the Lord.

   Our faith from our forefathers, which also we have learned from thee,
   Blessed Pope, is this:--We acknowledge One God, alone Ingenerate, alone
   Everlasting, alone Unbegun, alone True, alone having Immortality, alone
   Wise, alone Good, alone Sovereign; Judge, Governor, and Providence of
   all, unalterable and unchangeable, just and good, God of Law and
   Prophets and New Testament; who begat an Only-begotten Son before
   eternal times, through whom He has made both the ages and the universe;
   and begat Him, not in semblance, but in truth; and that He made Him
   subsist at His own will, unalterable and unchangeable; perfect creature
   of God, but not as one of the creatures; offspring, but not as one of
   things begotten; nor as Valentinus pronounced that the offspring of the
   Father was an issue [3510] ; nor as ManichÃ¦us taught that the offspring
   was a portion of the Father, one in essence [3511] ; or as Sabellius,
   dividing the Monad, speaks of a Son-and-Father [3512] ; nor as
   Hieracas, of one torch from another, or as a lamp divided into two
   [3513] ; nor that He who was before, was afterwards generated or
   new-created into a Son [3514] , as thou too thyself, Blessed Pope, in
   the midst of the Church and in session hast often condemned; but, as we
   say, at the will of God, created before times and before ages, and
   gaining life and being from the Father, who gave subsistence to His
   glories together with Him. For the Father did not, in giving to Him the
   inheritance of all things, deprive Himself of what He has ingenerately
   in Himself; for He is the Fountain of all things. Thus there are Three
   Subsistences. And God, being the cause of all things, is Unbegun and
   altogether Sole, but the Son being begotten apart from time by the
   Father, and being created and founded before ages, was not before His
   generation, but being begotten apart from time before all things, alone
   was made to subsist by the Father. For He is not eternal or co-eternal
   or co-unoriginate with the Father, nor has He His being together with
   the Father, as some speak of relations [3515] , introducing two
   ingenerate beginnings, but God is before all things as being Monad and
   Beginning of all. Wherefore also He is before the Son; as we have
   learned also from thy preaching in the midst of the Church. So far then
   as from God He has being, and glories, and life, and all things are
   delivered unto Him, in such sense is God His origin. For He is above
   Him, as being His God and before Him. But if the terms from Him,' and
   from the womb,' and I came forth from the Father, and I am come [3516]
   ' (Rom. xi. 36; Ps. cx. 3; John xvi. 28), be understood by some to mean
   as if a part of Him, one in essence or as an issue, then the Father is
   according to them compounded and divisible and alterable and material,
   and, as far as their belief goes, has the circumstances of a body, Who
   is the Incorporeal God.

   This is a part of what Arius and his fellows vomited from their
   heretical hearts.

   17. And before the Nicene Council took place, similar statements were
   made by Eusebius and his fellows, Narcissus, Patrophilus, Maris,
   Paulinus, Theodotus, and Athanasius of [A]nazarba [3517] . And Eusebius
   of Nicomedia wrote over and above to Arius, to this effect, Since your
   sentiments are good, pray that all may adopt them; for it is plain to
   any one, that what has been made was not before its origination; but
   what came to be has a beginning of being.' And Eusebius of CÃ¦sarea in
   Palestine, in a letter to Euphration the Bishop [3518] , did not
   scruple to say plainly that Christ was not true God [3519] . And
   Athanasius of [A]nazarba uncloked the heresy still further, saying that
   the Son of God was one of the hundred sheep. For writing to Alexander
   the Bishop, he had the extreme audacity to say: Why complain of Arius
   and his fellows, for saying, The Son of God is made as a creature out
   of nothing, and one among others? For all that are made being
   represented in parable by the hundred sheep, the Son is one of them. If
   then the hundred are not created and originate, or if there be beings
   beside that hundred, then may the Son be not a creature nor one among
   others; but if those hundred are all originate, and there is nothing
   besides the hundred save God alone, what absurdity do Arius and his
   fellows utter, when, as comprehending and reckoning Christ in the
   hundred, they say that He is one among others?' And George who now is
   in Laodicea, and then was presbyter of Alexandria, and was staying at
   Antioch, wrote to Alexander the Bishop; Do not complain of Arius and
   his fellows, for saying, "Once the Son of God was not," for Isaiah came
   to be son of Amos, and, whereas Amos was before Isaiah came to be,
   Isaiah was not before, but came to be afterwards.' And he wrote to the
   Arians, Why complain of Alexander the Pope, saying, that the Son is
   from the Father? for you too need not fear to say that the Son was from
   God.' For if the Apostle wrote (1 Cor. xi. 12), All things are from
   God,' and it is plain that all things are made of nothing, though the
   Son too is a creature and one of things made, still He may be said to
   be from God in that sense in which all things are said to be from God.'
   From him then those who hold with Arius learned to simulate the phrase
   from God,' and to use it indeed, but not in a good meaning. And George
   himself was deposed by Alexander for certain reasons, and among them
   for manifest irreligion; for he was himself a presbyter, as has been
   said before.

   18. On the whole then such were their statements, as if they all were
   in dispute and rivalry with each other, which should make the heresy
   more irreligious, and display it in a more naked form. And as for their
   letters I had them not at hand, to dispatch them to you; else I would
   have sent you copies; but, if the Lord will, this too I will do, when I
   get possession of them. And one Asterius [3520] from Cappadocia, a
   many-headed Sophist, one of the fellows of Eusebius, whom they could
   not advance into the Clergy, as having done sacrifice in the former
   persecution in the time of Constantius's grandfather, writes, with the
   countenance of Eusebius and his fellows, a small treatise, which was on
   a par with the crime of his sacrifice, yet answered their wishes; for
   in it, after comparing, or rather preferring, the locust and the
   caterpillar to Christ, and saying that Wisdom in God was other than
   Christ, and was the Framer as well of Christ as of the world, he went
   round the Churches in Syria and elsewhere, with introductions from
   Eusebius and his fellows, that as he once made trial of denying, so now
   he might boldly oppose the truth. The bold man intruded himself into
   forbidden places, and seating himself in the place of Clergy [3521] ,
   he used to read publicly this treatise of his, in spite of the general
   indignation. The treatise is written at great length, but portions of
   it are as follows:--

   For the Blessed Paul said not that he preached Christ, His, that is,
   God's, own Power' or Wisdom,' but without the article, God's Power and
   God's Wisdom' (1 Cor. i. 24), preaching that the own power of God
   Himself was distinct, which was con-natural and co-existent with Him
   unoriginately, generative indeed of Christ, creative of the whole
   world; concerning which he teaches in his Epistle to the Romans, thus,
   The invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly
   seen, being understood by the things which are made, even His eternal
   power and divinity' (Rom. i. 20). For as no one would say that the
   Deity there mentioned was Christ, but the Father Himself, so, as I
   think, His eternal power is also not the Only-begotten God (Joh. i.
   18), but the Father who begat Him. And he tells us of another Power and
   Wisdom of God, namely, that which is manifested through Christ, and
   made known through the works themselves of His Ministry.

   And again:--

   Although His eternal Power and Wisdom, which truth argues to be Unbegun
   and Ingenerate, would appear certainly to be one and the same, yet many
   are those powers which are one by one created by Him, of which Christ
   is the First-born and Only-begotten. All however equally depend upon
   their Possessor, and all His powers are rightly called His, who created
   and uses them; for instance, the Prophet says that the locust, which
   became a divine punishment of human sin, was called by God Himself, not
   only a power of God, but a great power (Joel ii. 25). And the blessed
   David too in several of the Psalms, invites, not Angels alone, but
   Powers also to praise God. And while he invites them all to the hymn,
   he presents before us their multitude, and is not unwilling to call
   them ministers of God, and teaches them to do His will.

   19. These bold words against the Saviour did not content him, but he
   went further in his blasphemies, as follows:

   The Son is one among others; for He is first of things originate, and
   one among intellectual natures; and as in things visible the sun is one
   among phenomena, and it shines upon the whole world according to the
   command of its Maker, so the Son, being one of the intellectual
   natures, also enlightens and shines upon all that are in the
   intellectual world.

   And again he says, Once He was not, writing thus:--And before the Son's
   origination, the Father had pre-existing knowledge how to generate;
   since a physician too, before he cured, had the science of curing
   [3522] .' And he says again: The Son was created by God's beneficent
   earnestness; and the Father made Him by the superabundance of His
   Power.' And again: If the will of God has pervaded all the works in
   succession, certainly the Son too, being a work, has at His will come
   to be and been made.' Now though Asterius was the only person to write
   all this, Eusebius and his fellows felt the like in common with him.

   20. These are the doctrines for which they are contending; for these
   they assail the ancient Council, because its members did not propound
   the like, but anathematized the Arian heresy instead, which they were
   so eager to recommend. This was why they put forward, as an advocate of
   their irreligion, Asterius who sacrificed, a sophist too, that he might
   not spare to speak against the Lord, or by a show of reason to mislead
   the simple. And they were ignorant, the shallow men, that they were
   doing harm to their own cause. For the ill savour of their advocate's
   idolatrous sacrifice betrayed still more plainly that the heresy is
   Christ's foe. And now again, the general agitations and troubles which
   they are exciting, are in consequence of their belief, that by their
   numerous murders and their monthly Councils, at length they will undo
   the sentence which has been passed against the Arian heresy [3523] .
   But here too they seem ignorant, or to pretend ignorance, that even
   before Nicea that heresy was held in detestation, when Artemas [3524]
   was laying its foundations, and before him Caiaphas's assembly and that
   of the Pharisees his contemporaries. And at all times is this gang of
   Christ's foes detestable, and will not cease to be hateful, the Lord's
   Name being full of love, and the whole creation bending the knee, and
   confessing that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father'
   (Phil. ii. 11).

   21. Yet so it is, they have convened successive Councils against that
   Ecumenical One, and are not yet tired. After the Nicene, Eusebius and
   his fellows had been deposed; however, in course of time they intruded
   themselves without shame upon the Churches, and began to plot against
   the Bishops who withstood them, and to substitute in the Church men of
   their own heresy. Thus they thought to hold Councils at their pleasure,
   as having those who concurred with them, whom they had ordained on
   purpose for this very object. Accordingly, they assemble at Jerusalem,
   and there they write thus:--

   The Holy Council assembled in Jerusalem [3525] by the grace of God,
   &c....their orthodox teaching in writing [3526] , which we all
   confessed to be sound and ecclesiastical. And he reasonably recommended
   that they should be received and united to the Church of God, as you
   will know yourselves from the transcript of the same Epistle, which we
   have transmitted to your reverences. We believe that yourselves also,
   as if recovering the very members of your own body, will experience
   great joy and gladness, in acknowledging and recovering your own
   bowels, your own brethren and fathers; since not only the Presbyters,
   Arius and his fellows, are given back to you, but also the whole
   Christian people and the entire multitude, which on occasion of the
   aforesaid men have a long time been in dissension among you. Moreover
   it were fitting, now that you know for certain what has passed, and
   that the men have communicated with us and have been received by so
   great a Holy Council, that you should with all readiness hail this your
   coalition and peace with your own members, specially since the articles
   of the faith which they have published preserve indisputable the
   universally confessed apostolical tradition and teaching.

   22. This was the beginning of their Councils, and in it they were
   speedy in divulging their views, and could not conceal them. For when
   they said that they had banished all jealousy, and, after the expulsion
   of Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria, recommended the reception of Arius
   and his friends, they shewed that their measures against Athanasius
   himself then, and before against all the other Bishops who withstood
   them, had for their object their receiving Arius and his fellows, and
   introducing the heresy into the Church. But although they had approved
   in this Council all Arius's malignity, and had ordered to receive his
   party into communion, as they had set the example, yet feeling that
   even now they were short of their wishes, they assembled a Council at
   Antioch under colour of the so-called Dedication [3527] and, since they
   were in general and lasting odium for their heresy, they publish
   different letters, some of this sort, and some of that and what they
   wrote in one letter was as follows:--

   We have not been followers of Arius,--how could Bishops, such as we,
   follow a Presbyter?--nor did we receive any other faith beside that
   which has been handed down from the beginning. But, after taking on
   ourselves to examine and to verify his faith, we admitted him rather
   than followed him; as you will understand from our present avowals.

   For we have been taught from the first, to believe [3528] in one God,
   the God of the Universe, the Framer and Preserver of all things both
   intellectual and sensible.

   And in One Son of God, Only-begotten, who existed before all ages, and
   was with the Father who had begotten Him, by whom all things were made,
   both visible and invisible, who in the last days according to the good
   pleasure of the Father came down; and has taken flesh of the Virgin,
   and jointly fulfilled all His Father's will, and suffered and risen
   again, and ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of the
   Father, and cometh again to judge quick and dead, and remaineth King
   and God unto all ages.

   And we believe also in the Holy Ghost; and if it be necessary to add,
   we believe concerning the resurrection of the flesh, and the life
   everlasting.

   23. Here follows what they published next at the same Dedication in
   another Epistle, being dissatisfied with the first, and devising
   something newer and fuller:

   We believe [3529] , conformably to the evangelical and apostolical
   tradition, in One God, the Father Almighty, the Framer, and Maker, and
   Provider of the Universe, from whom are all things.

   And in One Lord Jesus Christ, His Son, Only-begotten God (Joh. i. 18),
   by whom are all things, who was begotten before all ages from the
   Father, God from God, whole from whole, sole from sole [3530] , perfect
   from perfect, King from King, Lord from Lord, Living Word, Living
   Wisdom, true Light, Way, Truth, Resurrection, Shepherd, Door, both
   unalterable and [3531] unchangeable; exact Image [3532] of the Godhead,
   Essence, Will, Power and Glory of the Father; the first born of every
   creature, who was in the beginning with God, God the Word, as it is
   written in the Gospel, and the Word was God' (John i. 1); by whom all
   things were made, and in whom all things consist; who in the last days
   descended from above, and was born of a Virgin according to the
   Scriptures, and was made Man, Mediator [3533] between God and man, and
   Apostle of our faith, and Prince of life, as He says, I came down from
   heaven, not to do Mine own will, but the will of Him that sent Me'
   (John vi. 38); who suffered for us and rose again on the third day, and
   ascended into heaven, and sat down on the right hand of the Father, and
   is coming again with glory and power, to judge quick and dead.

   And in the Holy Ghost, who is given to those who believe for comfort,
   and sanctification, and initiation, as also our Lord Jesus Christ
   enjoined His disciples, saying, Go ye, teach all nations, baptizing
   them in the Name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost' (Matt.
   xxviii. 19); namely of a Father who is truly Father, and a Son who is
   truly Son, and of the Holy Ghost who is truly Holy Ghost, the names not
   being given without meaning or effect, but denoting accurately the
   peculiar subsistence, rank, and glory of each that is named, so that
   they are three in subsistence, and in agreement one [3534] .

   Holding then this faith, and holding it in the presence of God and
   Christ, from beginning to end, we anathematize every heretical
   heterodoxy [3535] . And if any teaches, beside the sound and right
   faith of the Scriptures, that time, or season, or age [3536] , either
   is or has been before the generation of the Son, be he anathema. Or if
   any one says, that the Son is a creature as one of the creatures, or an
   offspring as one of the offsprings, or a work as one of the works, and
   not the aforesaid articles one after another, as the divine Scriptures
   have delivered, or if he teaches or preaches beside what we received,
   be he anathema. For all that has been delivered in the divine
   Scriptures, whether by Prophets or Apostles, do we truly and
   reverentially both believe and follow [3537] .

   24. And one Theophronius [3538] , Bishop of Tyana, put forth before
   them all the following statement of his personal faith. And they
   subscribed it, accepting the faith of this man:--

   God [3539] knows, whom I call as a witness upon my soul, that so I
   believe:--in God the Father Almighty, the Creator and Maker of the
   Universe, from whom are all things.

   And in His Only-begotten Son, Word, Power, and Wisdom, our Lord Jesus
   Christ, through whom are all things; who has been begotten from the
   Father before the ages, perfect God from perfect God [3540] , and was
   with God in subsistence, and in the last days descended, and was born
   of the Virgin according to the Scriptures, and was made man, and
   suffered, and rose again from the dead, and ascended into the heavens,
   and sat down on the right hand of His Father, and cometh again with
   glory and power to judge quick and dead, and remaineth for ever:

   And in the Holy Ghost, the Paraclete, the Spirit of truth (Joh. xv.
   26), which also God promised by His Prophet to pour out (Joel ii. 28)
   upon His servants, and the Lord promised to send to His disciples:
   which also He sent, as the Acts of the Apostles witness.

   But if any one teaches, or holds in his mind, aught beside this faith,
   be he anathema; or with Marcellus of Ancyra [3541] , or Sabellius, or
   Paul of Samosata, be he anathema, both himself and those who
   communicate with him.

   25. Ninety Bishops met at the Dedication under the Consulate of
   Marcellinus and Probinus, in the 14th of the Indiction [3542] ,
   Constantius the most irreligious being present. Having thus conducted
   matters at Antioch at the Dedication, thinking that their composition
   was deficient still, and fluctuating moreover in their own opinions,
   again they draw up afresh another formulary, after a few months,
   professedly concerning the faith, and despatch Narcissus, Maris,
   Theodorus, and Mark into Gaul [3543] . And they, as being sent from the
   Council, deliver the following document to Constans Augustus of blessed
   memory, and to all who were there:

   We believe [3544] in One God, the Father Almighty, Creator and Maker of
   all things; from whom all fatherhood in heaven and on earth is named.
   (Eph. iii. 15.)

   And in His Only-begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, who before all
   ages was begotten from the Father, God from God, Light from Light, by
   whom all things were made in the heavens and on the earth, visible and
   invisible, being Word, and Wisdom, and Power, and Life, and True Light;
   who in the last days was made man for us, and was born of the Holy
   Virgin; who was crucified, and dead, and buried, and rose again from
   the dead the third day, and was taken up into heaven, and sat down on
   the right hand of the Father; and is coming at the consummation of the
   age, to judge quick and dead, and to render to every one according to
   his works; whose Kingdom endures indissolubly into the infinite ages
   [3545] ; for He shall be seated on the right hand of the Father, not
   only in this age but in that which is to come.

   And in the Holy Ghost, that is, the Paraclete; which, having promised
   to the Apostles, He sent forth after His ascension into heaven, to
   teach them and to remind of all things; through whom also shall be
   sanctified the souls of those who sincerely believe in Him.

   But those who say, that the Son was from nothing, or from other
   subsistence and not from God, and, there was time when He was not, the
   Catholic Church regards as aliens [3546] .

   26. As if dissatisfied with this, they hold their meeting again after
   three years, and dispatch Eudoxius, Martyrius, and Macedonius of
   Cilicia [3547] , and some others with them, to the parts of Italy, to
   carry with them a faith written at great length, with numerous
   additions over and above those which have gone before. They went abroad
   with these, as if they had devised something new.

   We believe [3548] in one God the Father Almighty, the Creator and Maker
   of all things, from whom all fatherhood in heaven and on earth is
   named.

   And in His Only-begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ, who before all ages
   was begotten from the Father, God from God, Light from Light, by whom
   all things were made, in heaven and on the earth, visible and
   invisible, being Word and Wisdom and Power and Life and True Light, who
   in the last days was made man for us, and was born of the Holy Virgin,
   crucified and dead and buried, and rose again from the dead the third
   day, and was taken up into heaven, and sat down on the right hand of
   the Father, and is coming at the consummation of the age to judge quick
   and dead, and to render to every one according to his works, whose
   Kingdom endures unceasingly unto the infinite ages; for He sitteth on
   the right hand of the Father not only in this age, but also in that
   which is to come.

   And we believe in the Holy Ghost, that is, the Paraclete, which, having
   promised to the Apostles, He sent forth after the ascension into
   heaven, to teach them and to remind of all things: through whom also
   shall be sanctified the souls of those who sincerely believe in Him.

   But those who say, (1) that the Son was from nothing, or from other
   subsistence and not from God; (2) and that there was a time or age when
   He was not, the Catholic and Holy Church regards as aliens. Likewise
   those who say, (3) that there are three Gods: (4) or that Christ is not
   God; (5) or that before the ages He was neither Christ nor Son of God;
   (6) or that Father and Son, or Holy Ghost, are the same; (7) or that
   the Son is Ingenerate; or that the Father begat the Son, not by choice
   or will; the Holy and Catholic Church anathematizes.

   (1.) For neither is safe to say that the Son is from nothing, (since
   this is no where spoken of Him in divinely inspired Scripture,) nor
   again of any other subsistence before existing beside the Father, but
   from God alone do we define Him genuinely to be generated. For the
   divine Word teaches that the Ingenerate and Unbegun, the Father of
   Christ, is One [3549] .

   (2.) Nor may we, adopting the hazardous position, There was once when
   He was not,' from unscriptural sources, imagine any interval of time
   before Him, but only the God who has generated Him apart from time; for
   through Him both times and ages came to be. Yet we must not consider
   the Son to be co-unbegun and co-ingenerate with the Father; for no one
   can be properly called Father or Son of one who is co-unbegun and
   co-ingenerate with Him [3550] . But we acknowledge [3551] that the
   Father who alone is Unbegun and Ingenerate, hath generated
   inconceivably and incomprehensibly to all: and that the Son hath been
   generated before ages, and in no wise to be ingenerate Himself like the
   Father, but to have the Father who generated Him as His beginning; for
   the Head of Christ is God.' (1 Cor. xi. 3.)

   (3.) Nor again, in confessing three realities and three Persons, of the
   Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost according to the Scriptures, do
   we therefore make Gods three; since we acknowledge the Self-complete
   and Ingenerate and Unbegun and Invisible God to be one only [3552] ,
   the God and Father (Joh. xx. 17) of the Only-begotten, who alone hath
   being from Himself, and alone vouchsafes this to all others
   bountifully.

   (4.) Nor again, in saying that the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is
   one only God, the only Ingenerate, do we therefore deny that Christ
   also is God before ages: as the disciples of Paul of Samosata, who say
   that after the incarnation He was by advance [3553] made God, from
   being made by nature a mere man. For we acknowledge, that though He be
   subordinate to His Father and God, yet, being before ages begotten of
   God, He is God perfect according to nature and true [3554] , and not
   first man and then God, but first God and then becoming man for us, and
   never having been deprived of being.

   (5.) We abhor besides, and anathematize those who make a pretence of
   saying that He is but the mere word of God and unexisting, having His
   being in another,--now as if pronounced, as some speak, now as mental
   [3555] ,--holding that He was not Christ or Son of God or mediator or
   image of God before ages; but that He first became Christ and Son of
   God, when He took our flesh from the Virgin, not quite four hundred
   years since. For they will have it that then Christ began His Kingdom,
   and that it will have an end after the consummation of all and the
   judgment [3556] . Such are the disciples of Marcellus and Scotinus
   [3557] of Galatian Ancyra, who, equally with Jews, negative Christ's
   existence before ages, and His Godhead, and unending Kingdom, upon
   pretence of supporting the divine Monarchy. We, on the contrary, regard
   Him not as simply God's pronounced word or mental, but as Living God
   and Word, existing in Himself, and Son of God and Christ; being and
   abiding with His Father before ages, and that not in foreknowledge only
   [3558] , and ministering to Him for the whole framing whether of things
   visible or invisible. For He it is, to whom the Father said, Let Us
   make man in Our image, after Our likeness [3559] ' (Gen. i. 26), who
   also was seen in His own Person [3560] by the patriarchs, gave the law,
   spoke by the prophets, and at last, became man, and manifested His own
   Father to all men, and reigns to never-ending ages. For Christ has
   taken no recent dignity, but we have believed Him to be perfect from
   the first, and like in all things to the Father [3561] .

   (6.) And those who say that the Father and Son and Holy Ghost are the
   same, and irreligiously take the Three Names of one and the same
   Reality and Person, we justly proscribe from the Church, because they
   suppose the illimitable and impassible Father to be limitable withal
   and passible through His becoming man: for such are they whom Romans
   call Patripassians, and we Sabellians [3562] . For we acknowledge that
   the Father who sent, remained in the peculiar state of His unchangeable
   Godhead, and that Christ who was sent fulfilled the economy of the
   Incarnation.

   (7.) And at the same time those who irreverently say that the Son has
   been generated not by choice or will, thus encompassing God with a
   necessity which excludes choice and purpose, so that He begat the Son
   unwillingly, we account as most irreligious and alien to the Church; in
   that they have dared to define such things concerning God, beside the
   common notions concerning Him, nay, beside the purport of divinely
   inspired Scripture. For we, knowing that God is absolute and sovereign
   over Himself, have a religious judgment that He generated the Son
   voluntarily and freely; yet, as we have a reverent belief in the Son's
   words concerning Himself (Prov. viii. 22), The Lord created me a
   beginning of His ways for His works,' we do not understand Him to have
   been originated like the creatures or works which through Him came to
   be. For it is irreligious and alien to the ecclesiastical faith, to
   compare the Creator with handiworks created by Him, and to think that
   He has the same manner of origination with the rest. For divine
   Scripture teaches us really and truly that the Only-begotten Son was
   generated sole and solely [3563] . Yet [3564] , in saying that the Son
   is in Himself, and both lives and exists like the Father, we do not on
   that account separate Him from the Father, imagining place and interval
   between their union in the way of bodies. For we believe that they are
   united with each other without mediation or distance [3565] , and that
   they exist inseparable; all the Father embosoming the Son, and all the
   Son hanging and adhering to the Father, and alone resting on the
   Father's breast continually [3566] . Believing then in the All-perfect
   Triad, the most Holy, that is, in the Father, and the Son, and the Holy
   Ghost, and calling the Father God, and the Son God, yet we confess in
   them, not two Gods, but one dignity of Godhead, and one exact harmony
   of dominion, the Father alone being Head over the whole universe
   wholly, and over the Son Himself, and the Son subordinated to the
   Father; but, excepting Him, ruling over all things after Him which
   through Himself have come to be, and granting the grace of the Holy
   Ghost unsparingly to the saints at the Father's will. For that such is
   the account of the Divine Monarchy towards Christ, the sacred oracles
   have delivered to us.

   Thus much, in addition to the faith before published in epitome, we
   have been compelled to draw forth at length, not in any officious
   display, but to clear away all unjust suspicion concerning our
   opinions, among those who are ignorant of our affairs: and that all in
   the West may know, both the audacity of the slanders of the heterodox,
   and as to the Orientals, their ecclesiastical mind in the Lord, to
   which the divinely inspired Scriptures bear witness without violence,
   where men are not perverse.

   27. However they did not stand even to this; for again at Sirmium
   [3567] they met together [3568] against Photinus [3569] and there
   composed a faith again, not drawn out into such length, not so full in
   words; but subtracting the greater part and adding in its place, as if
   they had listened to the suggestions of others, they wrote as
   follows:--

   We believe [3570] in One God, the Father Almighty, the Creator and
   Maker of all things, from whom all fatherhood in heaven and earth is
   named [3571] '

   And in His Only-begotten Son, our Lord Jesus the Christ, who before all
   the ages was begotten from the Father, God from God, Light from Light,
   by whom all things were made, in heaven and on the earth, visible and
   invisible, being Word and Wisdom and True Light and Life, who in the
   last of days was made man for us, and was born of the Holy Virgin, and
   crucified and dead and buried, and rose again from the dead the third
   day, and was taken up into heaven, and sat down on the right hand of
   the Father, and is coming at the consummation of the age, to judge
   quick and dead, and to render to every one according to his works;
   whose Kingdom being unceasing endures unto the infinite ages; for He
   shall sit on the right hand of the Father, not only in this age, but
   also in that which is to come.

   And in the Holy Ghost, that is, the Paraclete; which, having promised
   to the Apostles to send forth after His ascension into heaven, to teach
   and to remind them of all things, He did send; through whom also are
   sanctified the souls of those who sincerely believe in Him.

   (1.) But those who say that the Son was from nothing or from other
   subsistence [3572] and not from God, and that there was time or age
   when He was not, the Holy and Catholic Church regards as aliens.

   (2.) Again we say, Whosoever says that the Father and the Son are two
   Gods, be he anathema [3573] .

   (3.) And whosoever, saying that Christ is God, before ages Son of God,
   does not confess that He has subserved the Father for the framing of
   the universe, be he anathema [3574] .

   (4.) Whosoever presumes to say that the Ingenerate, or a part of Him,
   was born of Mary, be he anathema.

   (5.) Whosoever says that according to foreknowledge [3575] the Son is
   before Mary and not that, generated from the Father before ages, He was
   with God, and that through Him all things were originated, be he
   anathema.

   (6.) Whosoever shall pretend that the essence of God is dilated or
   contracted [3576] , be he anathema.

   (7.) Whosoever shall say that the essence of God being dilated made the
   Son, or shall name the dilation of His essence Son, be he anathema.

   (8.) Whosoever calls the Son of God the mental or pronounced Word
   [3577] , be he anathema.

   (9.) Whosoever says that the Son from Mary is man only, be he anathema.

   (10.) Whosoever, speaking of Him who is from Mary God and man, thereby
   means God the Ingenerate [3578] , be he anathema.

   (11.) Whosoever shall explain I God the First and I the Last, and
   besides Me there is no God,' (Is. xliv. 6), which is said for the
   denial of idols and of gods that are not, to the denial of the
   Only-begotten, before ages God, as Jews do, be he anathema.

   (12.) Whosoever hearing The Word was made flesh,' (John i. 14), shall
   consider that the Word has changed into flesh, or shall say that He has
   undergone alteration by taking flesh, be he anathema [3579] .

   (13.) Whosoever hearing the Only-begotten Son of God to have been
   crucified, shall say that His Godhead has undergone corruption, or
   passion. or alteration, or diminution, or destruction, be he anathema.

   (14.) Whosoever shall say that Let Us make man' (Gen. i. 26), was not
   said by the Father to the Son, but by God to Himself, be he anathema
   [3580] .

   (15.) Whosoever shall say that Abraham saw, not the Son, but the
   Ingenerate God or part of Him, be he anathema [3581] .

   (16.) Whosoever shall say that with Jacob, not the Son as man, but the
   Ingenerate God or part of Him, has wrestled, be he anathema [3582] .

   (17.) Whosoever shall explain, The Lord rained fire from the Lord'
   (Gen. xix. 24), not of the Father and the Son, and says that He rained
   from Himself, be he anathema. For the Son, being Lord, rained from the
   Father Who is Lord.

   (18.) Whosoever, hearing that the Father is Lord and the Son Lord and
   the Father and Son Lord, for there is Lord from Lord, says there are
   two Gods, be he anathema. For we do not place the Son in the Father's
   Order, but as subordinate to the Father; for He did not descend upon
   Sodom without the Father's will, nor did He rain from Himself, but from
   the Lord, that is, the Father authorising it. Nor is He of Himself set
   down on the right hand, but He hears the Father saying, Sit Thou on My
   right hand' (Ps. cx. 1).

   (19.) Whosoever says that the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost are
   one Person, be he anathema.

   (20.) Whosoever, speaking of the Holy Ghost as Paraclete, shall mean
   the Ingenerate God, be he anathema [3583] .

   (21.) Whosoever shall deny, what the Lord taught us, that the Paraclete
   is other than the Son, for He hath said, And another Paraclete shall
   the Father send to you, whom I will ask,' (John xiv. 16) be he
   anathema.

   (22.) Whosoever shall say that the Holy Ghost is part of the Father or
   of the Son [3584] be he anathema.

   (23.) Whosoever shall say that the Father and the Son and the Holy
   Ghost are three Gods, be he anathema.

   (24.) Whosoever shall say that the Son of God at the will of God has
   come to be, as one of the works, be he anathema.

   (25.) Whosoever shall say that the Son has been generated, the Father
   not wishing it [3585] , be he anathema. For not by compulsion, led by
   physical necessity, did the Father, as He wished not, generate the Son,
   but He at once willed, and, after generating Him from Himself apart
   from time and passion, manifested Him.

   (26.) Whosoever shall say that the Son is without beginning and
   ingenerate, as if speaking of two unbegun and two ingenerate, and
   making two Gods, be he anathema. For the Son is the Head, namely the
   beginning of all: and God is the Head, namely the beginning of Christ;
   for thus to one unbegun beginning of the universe do we religiously
   refer all things through the Son.

   (27.) And in accurate delineation of the idea of Christianity we say
   this again; Whosoever shall not say that Christ is God, Son of God, as
   being before ages, and having subserved the Father in the framing of
   the Universe, but that from the time that He was born of Mary, from
   thence He was called Christ and Son, and took an origin of being God,
   be he anathema.

   28. Casting aside the whole of this, as if they had discovered
   something better, they propound another faith, and write at Sirmium in
   Latin what is here translated into Greek [3586] .

   Whereas [3587] it seemed good that there should be some discussion
   concerning faith, all points were carefully investigated and discussed
   at Sirmium in the presence of Valens, and Ursacius, and Germinius, and
   the rest.

   It is held for certain that there is one God, the Father Almighty, as
   also is preached in all the world.

   And His One Only-begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, generated from
   Him before the ages; and that we may not speak of two Gods, since the
   Lord Himself has said, I go to My Father and your Father, and My God
   and your God' (John xx. 17). On this account He is God of all, as also
   the Apostle taught: Is He God of the Jews only, is He not also of the
   Gentiles? yea of the Gentiles also: since there is one God who shall
   justify the circumcision from faith, and the uncircumcision through
   faith' (Rom. iii. 29, 30); and every thing else agrees, and has no
   ambiguity.

   But since many persons are disturbed by questions concerning what is
   called in Latin Substantia,' but in Greek Usia,' that is, to make it
   understood more exactly, as to Coessential,' or what is called,
   Like-in-Essence,' there ought to be no mention of any of these at all,
   nor exposition of them in the Church, for this reason and for this
   consideration, that in divine Scripture nothing is written about them,
   and that they are above men's knowledge and above men's understanding;
   and because no one can declare the Son's generation, as it is written,
   Who shall declare His generation' (Is. liii. 8)? for it is plain that
   the Father only knows how He generated the Son, and again the Son how
   He has been generated by the Father. And to none can it be a question
   that the Father is greater: for no one can doubt that the Father is
   greater in honour and dignity and Godhead, and in the very name of
   Father, the Son Himself testifying, The Father that sent Me is greater
   than I' (John x. 29; xiv. 28). And no one is ignorant, that it is
   Catholic doctrine, that there are two Persons of Father and Son, and
   that the Father is greater, and the Son subordinated to the Father
   together with all things which the Father has subordinated to Him, and
   that the Father has no beginning, and is invisible, and immortal, and
   impassible; but that the Son has been generated from the Father, God
   from God, Light from Light, and that His origin, as aforesaid, no one
   knows, but the Father only. And that the Son Himself and our Lord and
   God, took flesh, that is, a body, that is, man, from Mary the Virgin,
   as the Angel preached beforehand; and as all the Scriptures teach, and
   especially the Apostle himself, the doctor of the Gentiles, Christ took
   man of Mary the Virgin, through which He has suffered. And the whole
   faith is summed up [3588] , and secured in this, that a Trinity should
   ever be preserved, as we read in the Gospel, Go ye and baptize all the
   nations in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost'
   (Matt. xxviii. 19). And entire and perfect is the number of the
   Trinity; but the Paraclete, the Holy Ghost, sent forth through the Son,
   came according to the promise, that He might teach and sanctify the
   Apostles and all believers [3589] .

   29. After drawing up this, and then becoming dissatisfied, they
   composed the faith which to their shame they paraded with the
   Consulate.' And, as is their wont, condemning this also, they caused
   Martinian the notary to seize it from the parties who had the copies of
   it [3590] . And having got the Emperor Constantius to put forth an
   edict against it, they form another dogma afresh, and with the addition
   of certain expressions, according to their wont, they write thus in
   Isauria.

   We decline [3591] not to bring forward the authentic faith published at
   the Dedication at Antioch [3592] ; though certainly our fathers at the
   time met together for a particular subject under investigation. But
   since Coessential' and Like-in-essence,' have troubled many persons in
   times past and up to this day, and since moreover some are said
   recently to have devised the Son's Unlikeness' to the Father, on their
   account we reject Coessential' and Like-in-essence,' as alien to the
   Scriptures, but Unlike' we anathematize, and account all who profess it
   as aliens from the Church. And we distinctly confess the Likeness' of
   the Son to the Father, according to the Apostle, who says of the Son,
   Who is the Image of the Invisible God' (Col. i. 15).

   And we confess and believe in one God, the Father Almighty, the Maker
   of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible.

   And we believe also in our Lord Jesus Christ, His Son, generated from
   Him impassibly before all the ages, God the Word, God from God,
   Only-begotten, light, life, truth, wisdom, power, through whom all
   things were made, in the heavens and on the earth, whether visible or
   invisible. He, as we believe, at the end of the world, for the
   abolishment of sin, took flesh of the Holy Virgin, and was made man,
   and suffered for our sins, and rose again, and was taken up into
   heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of the Father, and is coming
   again in glory, to judge quick and dead.

   We believe also in the Holy Ghost, which our Saviour and Lord named
   Paraclete, having promised to send Him to the disciples after His own
   departure, as He did send; through whom He sanctifieth those in the
   Church who believe, and are baptized in the Name of Father and Son and
   Holy Ghost.

   But those who preach aught beside this faith the Catholic Church
   regards as aliens. And that to this faith that is equivalent which was
   published lately at Sirmium, under sanction of his religiousness the
   Emperor, is plain to all who read it.

   30. Having written thus in Isauria, they went up to Constantinople
   [3593] , and there, as if dissatisfied, they changed it, as is their
   wont, and with some small additions against using even Subsistence' of
   Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, they transmitted it to those at Ariminum,
   and compelled even those in the said parts to subscribe, and those who
   contradicted them they got banished by Constantius. And it runs thus:--

   We believe [3594] in One God, Father Almighty, from whom are all
   things;

   And in the Only-begotten Son of God, begotten from God before all ages
   and before every beginning, by whom all things were made, visible and
   invisible, and begotten as only-begotten, only from the Father only
   [3595] , God from God, like to the Father that begat Him according to
   the Scriptures; whose origin no one knows, except the Father alone who
   begat Him. He as we acknowledge, the Only-begotten Son of God, the
   Father sending Him, came hither from the heavens, as it is written, for
   the undoing of sin and death, and was born of the Holy Ghost, of Mary
   the Virgin according to the flesh, as it is written, and convened with
   the disciples, and having fulfilled the whole Economy according to the
   Father's will, was crucified and dead and buried and descended to the
   parts below the earth; at whom hades itself shuddered: who also rose
   from the dead on the third day, and abode with the disciples, and,
   forty days being fulfilled, was taken up into the heavens, and sitteth
   on the right hand of the Father, to come in the last day of the
   resurrection in the Father's glory, that He may render to every man
   according to his works.

   And in the Holy Ghost, whom the Only-begotten Son of God Himself,
   Christ, our Lord and God, promised to send to the race of man, as
   Paraclete, as it is written, the Spirit of truth' (Joh. xvi. 13), which
   He sent unto them when He had ascended into the heavens.

   But the name of Essence,' which was set down by the Fathers in
   simplicity, and, being unknown by the people, caused offence, because
   the Scriptures contain it not, it has seemed good to abolish, and for
   the future to make no mention of it at all; since the divine Scriptures
   have made no mention of the Essence of Father and Son. For neither
   ought Subsistence to be named concerning Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
   But, we say that the Son is Like the Father, as the divine Scriptures
   say and teach; and all the heresies, both those which have been afore
   condemned already, and whatever are of modern date, being contrary to
   this published statement, be they anathema [3596] .

   31. However, they did not stand even to this: for coming down from
   Constantinople to Antioch, they were dissatisfied that they had written
   at all that the Son was Like the Father, as the Scriptures say;' and
   putting their ideas upon paper [3597] , they began reverting to their
   first doctrines, and said that the Son is altogether unlike the
   Father,' and that the Son is in no manner like the Father,' and so much
   did they change, as to admit those who spoke the Arian doctrine nakedly
   and to deliver to them the Churches with licence to bring forward the
   words of blasphemy with impunity [3598] . Because then of the extreme
   shamelessness of their blasphemy they were called by all Anomoeans,
   having also the name of Exucontian [3599] , and the heretical
   Constantius for the patron of their irreligion, who persisting up to
   the end in irreligion, and on the point of death, thought good to be
   baptized [3600] ; not however by religious men, but by Euzoius [3601] ,
   who for his Arianism had been deposed, not once, but often, both when
   he was a deacon, and when he was in the see of Antioch.

   32. The forementioned parties then had proceeded thus far, when they
   were stopped and deposed. But well I know, not even under these
   circumstances will they stop, as many as have now dissembled, [3602]
   but they will always be making parties against the truth, until they
   return to themselves and say, Let us rise and go to our fathers, and we
   will say unto them, We anathematize the Arian heresy, and we
   acknowledge the Nicene Council;' for against this is their quarrel. Who
   then, with ever so little understanding, will bear them any longer?
   who, on hearing in every Council some things taken away and others
   added, but perceives that their mind is shifty and treacherous against
   Christ? who on seeing them embodying to so great a length both their
   professions of faith, and their own exculpation, but sees that they are
   giving sentence against themselves, and studiously writing much which
   may be likely by their officious display and abundance of words to
   seduce the simple and hide what they are in point of heresy? But as the
   heathen, as the Lord said, using vain words in their prayers (Mat. vi.
   7), are nothing profited; so they too, after all this outpouring, were
   not able to quench the judgment pronounced against the Arian heresy,
   but were convicted and deposed instead; and rightly; for which of their
   formularies is to be accepted by the hearer? or with what confidence
   shall they be catechists to those who come to them? for if they all
   have one and the same meaning, what is the need of many? But if need
   has arisen of so many, it follows that each by itself is deficient, not
   complete; and they establish this point better than we can, by their
   innovating on them all and remaking them. And the number of their
   Councils, and the difference of their statements is a proof that those
   who were present at them, while at variance with the Nicene, are yet
   too feeble to harm the Truth.

   Philostorgius tells us that Arius wrote songs for the sea and for the
   mill and for the road, and then set them to suitable music,' Hist. ii.
   2. It is remarkable that Athanasius should say the Egyptian Sotades,
   and again in Sent. D. 6. There were two Poets of the name; one a writer
   of the Middle Comedy, Athen. Deipn. vii. 11; but the other, who is here
   spoken of, was a native of Maronea in Crete, according to Suidas (in
   voc.), under the successors of Alexander, Athen. xiv. 4. He wrote in
   Ionic metre, which was of infamous name from the subjects to which he
   and others applied it. vid. Suid. ibid. Horace's Ode. Miserarum est
   neque amori, &c.' is a specimen of this metre, and some have called it
   Sotadic; but Bentley shews in loc. that Sotades wrote in the Ionic a
   majore. AthenÃ¦us implies that all Ionic metres were called Sotadic, or
   that Sotades wrote in various Ionic metres. The Church adopted the
   Doric music, and forbade the Ionic and Lydian. The name Thalia'
   commonly belonged to convivial songs; Martial contrasts the lasciva
   Thalia' with carmina sanctiora,' Epigr. vii. 17. vid. Thaliarchus, the
   master of the feast,' Horat. Od. i. 9. [The metre of the fragments of
   the Thalia' is obscure, there are no traces of the Ionic foot, but very
   distinct anapÃ¦stic cadences. In fact the lines resemble ill-constructed
   or very corrupt anapÃ¦stic tetrameters catalectic, as in a comic
   Parabasis. For Sotades, the Greek text here reads corruptly Sosates.]

   Eusebius uses the word proballesthai. Eccl. Theol. i. 8. On the other

   [3514] Bull considers that the doctrine of such Fathers is here spoken
   of as held that our Lord's sunkatabasis to create the world was a
   gennesis, and certainly such language as that of Hippol. contr. Noet.
   Â§15. favours the supposition. But one class of [Monarchians] may more
   probably be intended, who held that the Word became the Son upon His
   incarnation, such as Marcellus, vid. Euseb. Eccles. Theol. i. 1. contr.
   Marc. ii. 3. vid. also Eccles. Theol. ii. 9. p. 114 b. med' allote
   allen k.t.l. Also the Macrostich says, We anathematize those who call
   Him the mere Word of God, not allowing Him to be Christ and Son of God
   before all ages, but from the time He took on Him our flesh: such are
   the followers of Marcellus and Photinus, &c.' infr. Â§26. Again,
   Athanasius, Orat. iv. 15, says that, of those who divide the Word from
   the Son, some called our Lord's manhood the Son, some the two Natures
   together, and some said that the Word Himself became the Son when He
   was made man.' It makes it more likely that Marcellus is meant, that
   Asterius seems to have written against him before the Nicene Council,
   and that Arius in other of his writings borrowed from Asterius. vid. de
   Decret. Â§8.

   [3515] Eusebius's letter to Euphration, which is mentioned just after,
   expresses this more distinctly--If they coexist, how shall the Father
   be Father and the Son Son? or how the One first, the Other second? and
   the One ingenerate and the other generate?' Acta Conc. 7. p. 301. The
   phrase ta pros ti Bull well explains to refer to the Catholic truth
   that the Father or Son being named; the Other is therein implied
   without naming. Defens. F. N. iii. 9. Â§4. Hence Arius, in his Letter to
   Eusebius, complains that Alexander says, aei ho theos, aei ho hui&

   [3517] Most of these original Arians were attacked in a work of
   Marcellus's which Eusebius answers. Now he replies to Asterius,' says
   Eusebius, now to the great Eusebius' [of Nicomedia], and then he turns
   upon that man of God, that indeed thrice blessed person Paulinus [of
   Tyre]. Then he goes to war with Origen....Next he marches out against
   Narcissus, and pursues the other Eusebius,' [himself]. In a word, he
   counts for nothing all the Ecclesiastical Fathers, being satisfied with
   no one but himself.' contr. Marc. i. 4. [On Maris (who was not at
   Ariminum, and scarcely at Antioch in 363) see D.C.B. s.v. (2). On
   Theodotus see vol. i. of this series, p. 320, note 37. On Paulinus, ib.

   [3520] Asterius has been mentioned above, p. 155, note 2, &c.
   Philostorgius speaks of him as adopting Semi-Arian terms; and Acacius
   gives an extract from him containing them, ap. Epiph. HÃ¦r. 72. 6. He
   seems to be called many-headed with an allusion to the Hydra, and to
   his activity in the Arian cause and his fertility in writing. He wrote
   comments on Scripture. [See Prolegg. ii. Â§3 (2) a, sub. fin.]

   [3526] This is supposed to be the same Confession which is preserved by
   Socr. i. 26. and Soz. ii. 27. and was presented to Constantine by Arius
   in 330.

   that known as the Formulary of the Dedication. It is quoted as such by

   Lucian, see Prolegg. ubi supr., and Caspari Alte. u. Neue Q. p. 42
   note.]

   [3530] Vid. 10th Confession, infr. Â§30.

   [3531] These strong words and those which follow, whether Lucian's or
   not, mark the great difference between this confession and the
   foregoing. The words unalterable and unchangeable' are formal
   anti-Arian symbols, as the trepton or alterable was one of the most
   characteristic parts of Arius's creed. vid. Orat. i. Â§35, &c.

   [3532] On aparallaktos eikon kat' ousian, which was synonymous with
   homoiousios, vid. infr. Â§38. supr. p. 163, note 9. It was in order to
   secure the true sense of aparallakton that the Council adopted the word
   homoousion 'Aparallakton is accordingly used as a familiar word by
   Athan. de Decr. Â§Â§20, 24. Orat. iii. Â§36. contr. Gent. 41. 46. fin.
   Philostorgius ascribing it to Asterius, and Acacius quotes a passage
   from his writings containing it; cf. S. Alexander ten kata panta

   Charakter, Hebr. i. 3. contains the same idea. Basil. contr. Eunom. i.
   18.

   [3533] This statement perhaps is the most Catholic in the Creed; not
   that the former are not more explicit in themselves, or that in a
   certain true sense our Lord may not be called a Mediator before He
   became incarnate, but because the Arians, even Eusebius, like Philo and
   the Platonists, consider Him as made in the beginning the Eternal
   Priest of the Father,' Demonst. v. 3. de Laud. C. 3, 11, an
   intermediate divine power,' Â§Â§26, 27, and notes.

   [3534] On this phrase, which is justified by S. Hilary, de Syn. 32, and
   is protested against in the Sardican Confession, Theod. H. E. ii. 6
   [see Prolegg. ubi supr.]

   [3535] The whole of these anathemas are [a compromise]. The Council
   anathematizes every heretical heterodoxy;' not, as Athanasius observes,
   supr., Â§7, the Arian.

   [3536] Our Lord was, as they held, before time, but still created.

   [3537] This emphatic mention of Scripture is also virtually an Arian
   evasion, admitting of a silent reference to themselves as interpreters
   of Scripture.

   [3538] On this Creed see Prolegg. ubi supr.

   [3539] 3rd Confession or 3rd of Antioch, a.d. 341.

   [3540] It need scarcely be said, that perfect from perfect' is a symbol
   on which the Catholics laid stress, Athan. Orat. ii. 35. Epiph. HÃ¦r.
   76. p. 945. but it admitted of an evasion. An especial reason for
   insisting on it in the previous centuries had been the Sabellian
   doctrine, which considered the title Word' when applied to our Lord to
   be adequately explained by the ordinary sense of the term, as a word
   spoken by us. In consequence they insisted on His to teleion,
   perfection, which became almost synonymous with His personality. (Thus
   the Apollinarians, e.g. denied that our Lord was perfect man, because
   His person was not human. Athan. contr. Apoll. i. 2.) And Athan.
   condemns the notion of the logos en to theo ateles, gennetheis teleios,
   Orat. iv. 11. The Arians then, as being the especial opponents of the
   Sabellians, insisted on nothing so much as our Lord's being a real,
   living, substantial, Word. vid. Eusebius passim. The Father,' says
   Acacius against Marcellus, begat the Only-begotten, alone alone, and
   perfect perfect; for there is nothing imperfect in the Father,
   wherefore neither is there in the Son, but the Son's perfection is the
   genuine offspring of His perfection, and superperfection.' ap. Epiph.
   HÃ¦r. 72. 7. Teleios then was a relative word, varying with the subject
   matter, vid. Damasc. F. O. i. 8. p. 138. and when the Arians said that
   our Lord was perfect God, they meant, perfect, in that sense in which
   He is God'--i.e. as a secondary divinity.--Nay, in one point of view,
   holding as they did no real condescension or assumption of a really new
   state, they would use the term of His divine Nature more freely than
   the Catholics sometimes had. Nor was the Word,' says Hippolytus, before
   the flesh and by Himself, perfect Son, though being perfect Word,
   Only-begotten; nor could the flesh subsist by itself without the Word,
   because that in the Word it has its consistence: thus then He was
   manifested One perfect Son of God.' contr. Noet. 15.

   [3541] [See Prolegg.] Marcellus wrote his work against Asterius in 335,
   the year of the Arian Council of Jerusalem, which at once took
   cognisance of it, and cited Marcellus to appear before them. The next
   year a Council held at Constantinople condemned and deposed him.

   [3543] [Cf. Prolegg. ii. Â§6 (3) init.]

   [3544] 4th Confession, or 4th of Antioch, a.d. 342. The fourth, fifth,
   and sixth Confessions are the same, and with them agree the Creed of
   Philippopolis [a.d. 343, see Gwatkin, Stud. p. 119, espec. note 2].

   [3545] These words, which answer to those [of our present Nicene'
   Creed], are directed against the doctrine of Marcellus [on which see
   Prolegg. ii. Â§3 (2) c, 3]. Cf. Eusebius, de Eccl. Theol. iii. 8. 17.
   cont. Marc. ii. 4.

   [3546] S. Hilary, as we have seen above, p. 78, by implication calls
   this the Nicene Anathema; but it omits many of the Nicene clauses, and
   evades our Lord's eternal existence, substituting for once He was not,'
   there was time when He was not.' It seems to have been considered
   sufficient for Gaul, as used now, for Italy as in the 5th Confession or
   Macrostich, and for Africa as in the creed of Philippopolis.

   [3547] Little is known of Macedonius who was Bishop of Mopsuestia, or
   of Martyrius; and too much of Eudoxius. This Long Confession, or
   Macrostich, which follows, is remarkable; [see Prolegg, ch. ii. Â§6 (3),
   Gwatkin, p. 125 sq.]

   [3548] 5th Confession or Macrostich, a.d. 344. [Published by the
   Council which deposed Stephen and elected Leontius bishop of Antioch.]

   [3549] It is observable that here and in the next paragraph the only
   reasons they give against using the only two Arian formulas which they
   condemn is that they are not found in Scripture. Here, in their
   explanation of the ex ouk onton, or from nothing, they do but deny it
   with Eusebius's evasion, supr. p. 75, note 5.

   [3550] They argue after the usual Arian manner, that the term Son'
   essentially implies beginning, and excludes the title co-unoriginate;'
   but see supr. Â§16, note 1, and p. 154, note 5.

   [3553] ek prokopes, de Decr. Â§10, note 10.

   [3554] These strong words, theon kata phusin teleion kai alethe are of
   a different character from any which have occurred in the Arian
   Confessions. They can only be explained away by considering them used
   in contrast to the Samosatene doctrine; so that perfect according to
   nature' and true,' will not be directly connected with God' so much as
   opposed to, by advance,' by adoption,' &c.

   [3555] The use of the words endiathetos and prophorikos, mental and
   pronounced, to distinguish the two senses of logos, reason and word,
   came from the school of the Stoics, and is found in Philo, and was
   under certain limitations allowed in Catholic theology, Damasc. F. O.
   ii. 21. To use either absolutely and to the exclusion of the other
   would have involved some form of Sabellianism, or Arianism as the case
   might be; but each might correct the defective sense of either. S.
   Theophilus speaks of our Lord as at once endiathetos and prophorikos.
   ad Autol. ii. 10 and 22, S. Cyril as endiathetos, in Joann. p. 39. but
   see also Thesaur. p. 47. When the Fathers deny that our Lord is the
   prophorikos logos, they only mean that that title is not, even as far
   as its philosophical idea went, an adequate representative of Him, a
   word spoken being insubstantive, vid. Orat. ii. 35; Hil. de Syn. 46;
   Cyr. Catech. xi. 10; Damas. Ep. ii. p. 203; Cyril in Joann. p. 31;
   Iren. HÃ¦r. ii. 12. n. 5. Marcellus is said by Eusebius to have
   considered our Lord as first the one and then the other. Eccl. Theol.
   ii. 15.

   [3556] This passage seems taken from Eusebius, and partly from
   Marcellus's own words. S. Cyril speaks of his doctrine in like terms.

   the text, The voice of the Lord God walking in the garden,' speaks of
   the Word, assuming the person, prosopon, of the Father,' and in the
   person of God,' ad Autol. ii. 22. the word not then having its
   theological sense.

   [3561] homoion kata panta. Here again we have a strong Semi-Arian or
   almost Catholic formula introduced by the bye. Of course it admitted of
   evasion, but in its fulness it included essence.' [See above Â§8, note
   1, and Introd.]

   [3562] See vol. i. of this series, p. 295, note 1. In the reason which
   the Confession alleges against that heretical doctrine it is almost
   implied that the divine nature of the Son suffered on the Cross. They
   would naturally fall into this notion directly they gave up our Lord's
   absolute divinity. It would naturally follow that our Lord had no human
   soul, but that His pre-existent nature stood in the place of it:--also
   that His Mediatorship was no peculiarity of His Incarnation. vid. Â§23,
   note 2. Â§27, Anath. 12, note.

   [3563] The Confession still insists upon the unscripturalness of the
   Catholic positions. On the main subject of this paragraph the thelesei

   [3564] The following passage is in its very form an interpolation or
   appendix, while its doctrine bears distinctive characters of something
   higher than the old absolute separation between the Father and the Son.
   [Eusebius of CÃ¦s. had] considered Them as two ousiai, homoiai like, but
   not as homoousioi; his very explanation of the word teleios was
   independent' and distinct.' Language then, such as that in the text,
   was the nearest assignable approach to the reception of the homoousion;

   [3566] De Decr. Â§26.

   [3567] Sirmium [Mitrowitz on the Save] was a city of lower Pannonia,
   not far from the Danube, and was the great bulwark of the Illyrian
   provinces of the Empire. There Vetranio assumed the purple; and there
   Constantius was born. The frontier war caused it to be from time to
   time the Imperial residence. We hear of Constantius at Sirmium in the
   summer of 357. Ammian. xvi. 10. He also passed there the ensuing
   winter. ibid. xvii. 12. In October, 358, after the Sarmatian war, he
   entered Sirmium in triumph, and passed the winter there. xvii. 13 fin.
   and with a short absence in the spring, remained there till the end of
   May, 359.

   [3568] [Cf. Prolegg. ch. ii. Â§7]. The leading person in this Council
   was Basil of Ancyra. Basil held a disputation with Photinus. Silvanus
   too of Tarsus now appears for the first time: while, according to
   Socrates, Mark of Arethusa drew up the Anathemas; the Confession used
   was the same as that sent to Constans, of the Council of Philippopolis,
   and the Macrostich.

   [3569] S. Hilary treats their creed as a Catholic composition. de Syn.
   39-63. Philastrius and Vigilius call the Council a meeting of holy
   bishops' and a Catholic Council,' de HÃ¦r. 65. in Eutych. v. init. What
   gave a character and weight to this Council was, that it met to set
   right a real evil, and was not a mere pretence with Arian objects.

   [3570] 6th Confession, or 1st Sirmian, a.d. 351.

   [3571] Eph. iii. 15.

   [3572] Vid. p. 77, sqq.

   [3573] This Anathema which has occurred in substance in the Macrostich,
   and again infr. Anath. 18 and 23. is a disclaimer of their in fact
   holding a supreme and a secondary God. In the Macrostich it is
   disclaimed upon a simple Arian basis. The Semi-Arians were more open to
   this imputation; Eusebius, as we have seen above, distinctly calling
   our Lord a second and another God. vid. p. 75, note 7. It will be
   observed that this Anathema contradicts the one which immediately
   follows, and the 11th, in which Christ is called God; except, on the
   one hand the Father and Son are One God, which was the Catholic
   doctrine, or, on the other, the Son is God in name only, which was the
   pure Arian or Anomoean.

   [3574] The language of Catholics and heretics is very much the same on
   this point of the Son's ministration, with this essential difference of
   sense, that Catholic writers mean a ministration internal to the divine
   substance and an instrument connatural with the Father, and Arius meant
   an external and created medium of operation. Thus S. Clement calls our
   Lord the All-harmonious Instrument (organon) of God.' Protrept. p. 6;
   Eusebius an animated and living instrument (organon empsuchon), nay,
   rather divine and vivific of every substance and nature.' Demonstr. iv.
   4. S. Basil, on the other hand, insists that the Arians reduced our
   Lord to an inanimate instrument,' organon apsuchon, though they called
   Him hupourgon teleiotaton, most perfect minister or underworker. adv.
   Eunom. ii. 21. Elsewhere he makes them say, the nature of a cause is
   one, and the nature of an instrument, organou, another;....foreign then
   in nature is the Son from the Father, since such is an instrument from
   a workman.' De Sp. S. n. 6 fin. vid. also n. 4 fin. 19, and 20. And so
   S. Gregory, The Father signifies, the Word accomplishes, not servilely,
   nor ignorantly, but with knowledge and sovereignty, and to speak more
   suitably, in a father's way, patrikos. Orat. 30. 11. Cf. S. Cyril, in
   Joann. p. 48. Explanations such as these secure for the Catholic
   writers some freedom in their modes of speaking, e.g. Athan. speaks of
   the Son, as enjoined and ministering,' prostattomenos, kai hupourgon,
   Orat. ii. Â§22. Thus S. IrenÃ¦us speaks of the Father being well-pleased
   and commanding, keleuontos, and the Son doing and framing. HÃ¦r. iv. 75.
   S. Basil too, in the same treatise in which are some of the foregoing
   protests, speaks of the Lord ordering,' prostassonta, and the word
   framing.' de Sp. S. n. 38, S. Cyril of Jerusalem, of Him who bids,
   entelletai, bidding to one who is present with Him,' Cat. xi. 16. vid.

   [3579] The 12th and 13th Anathemas are intended to meet the charge
   which is alluded to Â§26 (6), note 2, that Arianism involved the
   doctrine that our Lord's divine nature suffered. [But see Gwatkin, p.
   147.] Athanasius brings this accusation against them distinctly in his
   work against Apollinaris. contr. Apoll. i. 15. vid. also Ambros. de
   Fide, iii. 31. Salig in his de Eutychianismo ant. Eutychen takes notice
   of none of the passages in the text.

   [3580] This Anathema is directed against Marcellus, who held the very
   opinion which it denounces, that the Almighty spake with Himself.
   Euseb. Eccles. Theol. ii. 15. The Jews said that Almighty God spoke to
   the Angels. Basil. Hexaem. fin. Others that the plural was used as
   authorities on earth use it in way of dignity. Theod. in Gen. 19. As to
   the Catholic Fathers, as is well known, they interpreted the text in
   the sense here given. See Petav.

   [3581] This again, in spite of the wording. which is directed against
   the Catholic doctrine [or Marcellus?] is a Catholic interpretation.

   Petavius; also from Dorscheus, who has written an elaborate commentary
   on this Council, &c. The Catholic doctrine is that the Son has
   condescended to become visible by means of material appearances.
   Augustine seems to have been the first who changed the mode of viewing
   the texts in question, and considered the divine appearance, not God
   the Son, but a created Angel. Vid. de Trin. ii. passim. Jansenius
   considers that he did so from a suggestion of S. Ambrose, that the
   hitherto received view had been the origo hÃ¦resis ArianÃ¦, vid. his
   Augustinus, lib. prooem. c. 12. t. 2. p. 12.

   [3582] This and the following Canon are Catholic in their main
   doctrine, and might be illustrated, if necessary, as the foregoing.

   [3583] It was an expedient of the later Macedonians to deny that the
   Holy Spirit was God because it was not usual to call Him Ingenerate.
   They asked the Catholics whether the Holy Spirit was Ingenerate,
   generate, or created, for into these three they divided all things.
   vid. Basil in Sabell. et Ar. Hom. xxiv. 6. But, as the Arians had first
   made the alternative only between Ingenerate and created, and Athan. de
   Decr. Â§28. shews that generate is a third idea really distinct from one
   and the other, so S. Greg. Naz. adds. processive, ekporeuton, as an
   intermediate idea, contrasted with Ingenerate, yet distinct from
   generate. Orat. xxxi. 8. In other words, Ingenerate means, not only not
   generate, but not from any origin. vid. August. de Trin. xv. 26.

   [3589] It will be observed that this Confession; 1. by denying two
   Gods,' and declaring that the One God is the God of Christ, implies
   that our Lord is not God. 2. It says that the word substance,' and its
   compounds, ought not to be used as being unscriptural, mysterious, and
   leading to disturbance; 3. it holds that the Father is greater than the
   Son in honour, dignity, and godhead;' 4. that the Son is subordinate to
   the Father with all other things; 5. that it is the Father's
   characteristic to be invisible and impassible. They also say that our
   Lord, hominem suscepisse per quem compassus est, a word which
   Phoebadius condemns in his remarks on this Confession; where, by the
   way, he uses the word spiritus' in the sense of Hilary and the
   Ante-Nicene Fathers, in a connection which at once explains the obscure
   words of the supposititious Sardican Confession (vid. above, Â§9, note
   3), and turns them into another evidence of this additional heresy
   involved in Arianism. Impassibilis Deus,'says Phoebadius, quia Deus
   Spiritus...non ergo passibilis Dei Spiritus, licet in homine suo
   passus.' Now the Sardican Confession is thought ignorant, as well as
   unauthoritative, e.g. by Natalis Alex. SÃ¦c. 4. Diss. 29, because it
   imputes to Valens and Ursacius the following belief, which he supposes
   to be Patripassianism, but which exactly answers to this aspect and
   representation of Arianism: hoti ho logos kai hoti to pneuma kai
   estaurothe kai esphage kai apethanen kai aneste. Theod. H. E. ii. 6. p.

   majority, adds an anathema upon the Anomoean as well as on the
   HomoÃ¼sion and Homoeusion.

   [3593] These two sections seem to have been inserted by Athan. after
   his Letter was finished, and contain later occurrences in the history
   of Ariminum, than were contemplated when he wrote supr. Â§11. vid. note
   7 in loc. It should be added that at this Council Ulfilas the Apostle
   of the Goths, who had hitherto followed the Council of NicÃ¦a,
   conformed, and thus became the means of spreading through his
   countrymen the Creed of Ariminum.

   [3594] 10th Confession at NikÃ© and Constantinople, a.d. 359, 360.

   [3595] monos ek monou. This phrase may be considered a symptom of
   Anomoean influence; monos para, or hupo, monon being one special
   formula adopted by Eunomius, explanatory of monogenes, in accordance
   with the original Arian theory, mentioned de Decr. Â§7. supr. p. 154,
   that the Son was the one instrument of creation. Eunomius said that He
   alone was created by the Father alone; all other things being created
   by the Father, not alone, but through Him whom alone He had first
   created. vid. Cyril. Thesaur. 25. Basil contr. Eunom. ii. 21. Acacius
   ap. Epiph. HÃ¦r. 72. 7. p. 839.

   anathematizes all heresies, vid. supr. Â§23, n. 4.

   [3597] 11th Confession at Antioch, a.d. 361. [Socr. ii. 45. The
   occasion was the installation of Euzoius in place of Meletius.]

   [3598] Acacius, Eudoxius, and the rest, after ratifying at
   Constantinople the Creed framed at NikÃ© and subscribed at Ariminum,
   appear next at Antioch a year and a half later, when they throw off the
   mask, and, avowing the Anomoean Creed, revert,' as S. Athanasius says,
   to their first doctrines,' i.e. those with which Arius started.

   [3599] From ex ouk onton, out of nothing,' one of the original Arian
   positions concerning the Son. Theodoret says that they were also called
   HexakionitÃ¦, from the nature of their place of meeting, HÃ¦r. iv. 3. and
   Du Cange confirms it so far as to show that there was a place or
   quarter of Constantinople Hexakionium. [Cf. Soph. Lex. s.v.]

   [3600] This passage shews that Athanasius did not insert these sections
   till two years after the composition of the work itself; for
   Constantine died a.d. 361.

   [3601] Euzoius, now Arian Bishop of Antioch, was excommunicated with
   Arius in Egypt and at NicÃ¦a, and was restored with him to the Church at
   the Council of Jerusalem.

   an apparent allusion to 1 Tim. iv. 2. vid. Socr. i. p. 5, Orat. i. Â§8).
     __________________________________________________________________

   Part III. On the Symbols Of the Essence' And Coessential.'

   We must look at the sense not the wording. The offence excited is at
   the sense; meaning of the Symbols; the question of their not being in
   Scripture. Those who hesitate only at coessential,' not to be
   considered Arians. Reasons why coessential' is better than
   like-in-essence,' yet the latter may be interpreted in a good sense.
   Explanation of the rejection of coessential' by the Council which
   condemned the Samosatene; use of the word by Dionysius of Alexandria;
   parallel variation in the use of Unoriginate; quotation from Ignatius
   and another; reasons for using coessential;' objections to it;
   examination of the word itself; further documents of the Council of
   Ariminum.

   33. But since they are thus minded both towards each other and towards
   those who preceded them, proceed we to ascertain from them what
   absurdity they have seen, or what they complain of in the received
   phrases, that they have proved disobedient to parents' (Rom. i. 30),
   and contend against an Ecumenical Council [3603] ? The phrases "of the
   essence" and "coessential,"' say they, do not please us, for they are
   an offence to some and a trouble to many.' This then is what they
   allege in their writings; but one may reasonably answer them thus: If
   the very words were by themselves a cause of offence to them, it must
   have followed, not that some only should have been offended, and many
   troubled, but that we also and all the rest should have been affected
   by them in the same way; but if on the contrary all men are well
   content with the words, and they who wrote them were no ordinary
   persons but men who came together from the whole world, and to these
   testify in addition the 400 Bishops and more who now met at Ariminum,
   does not this plainly prove against those who accuse the Council, that
   the terms are not in fault, but the perverseness of those who
   misinterpret them? How many men read divine Scripture wrongly, and as
   thus conceiving it, find fault with the Saints? such were the former
   Jews, who rejected the Lord, and the present Manichees who blaspheme
   the Law [3604] ; yet are not the Scriptures the cause to them, but
   their own evil humours. If then ye can shew the terms to be actually
   unsound, do so and let the proof proceed, and drop the pretence of
   offence created, lest you come into the condition of the Pharisees of
   old. For when they pretended offence at the Lord's teaching, He said,
   Every plant, which My heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted
   up' (Matt. xv. 13). By which He shewed that not the words of the Father
   planted by Him were really an offence to them, but that they
   misinterpreted what was well said, and offended themselves. And in like
   manner they who at that time blamed the Epistles of the Apostle,
   impeached, not Paul, but their own deficient learning and distorted
   minds.

   34. For answer, what is much to the purpose, Who are they whom you
   pretend are offended and troubled at these terms? of those who are
   religious towards Christ not one; on the contrary they defend and
   maintain them. But if they are Arians who thus feel, what wonder they
   should be distressed at words which destroy their heresy? for it is not
   the terms which offend them, but the proscription of their irreligion
   which afflicts them. Therefore let us have no more murmuring against
   the Fathers, nor pretence of this kind; or next [3605] you will be
   making complaints of the Lord's Cross, because it is to Jews an offence
   and to Gentiles foolishness,' as said the Apostle [3606] (1 Cor. i. 23,
   24). But as the Cross is not faulty, for to us who believe it is Christ
   the power of God and the wisdom of God,' though Jews rave, so neither
   are the terms of the Fathers faulty, but profitable to those who
   honestly read, and subversive of all irreligion, though the Arians so
   often burst with rage as being condemned by them. Since then the
   pretence that persons are offended does not hold, tell us yourselves,
   why is it you are not pleased with the phrase of the essence' (this
   must first be enquired about), when you yourselves have written that
   the Son is generated from the Father? If when you name the Father, or
   use the word God,' you do not signify essence, or understand Him
   according to essence, who is that He is, but signify something else
   about Him [3607] , not to say inferior, then you should not have
   written that the Son was from the Father, but from what is about Him or
   in Him [3608] ; and so, shrinking from saying that God is truly Father,
   and making Him compound who is simple, in a material way, you will be
   authors of a newer blasphemy. And, with such ideas, you must needs
   consider the Word, and the title Son,' not as an essence but as a name
   [3609] only, and in consequence hold your own views as far as names
   only, and be talking, not of what you believe to exist, but of what you
   think not to exist.

   35. But this is more like the crime of the Sadducees, and of those
   among the Greeks who had the name of Atheists. It follows that you will
   deny that even creation is the handy-work of God Himself that is; at
   least, if Father' and God' do not signify the very essence of Him that
   is, but something else, which you imagine: which is irreligious, and
   most shocking even to think of. But if, when we hear it said, I am that
   I am,' and, In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,'
   and, Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord,' and, Thus saith the
   Lord Almighty' (Ex. iii. 14; Gen. i. 1; Deut. vi. 4), we understand
   nothing else than the very simple, and blessed, and incomprehensible
   essence itself of Him that is, (for though we be unable to master what
   He is, yet hearing Father,' and God,' and Almighty,' we understand
   nothing else to be meant than the very essence of Him that is [3610] );
   and if ye too have said, that the Son is from God, it follows that you
   have said that He is from the essence' of the Father. And since the
   Scriptures precede you which say, that the Lord is Son of the Father,
   and the Father Himself precedes them, who says, This is My beloved Son'
   (Matt. iii. 17), and a son is no other than the offspring from his
   father, is it not evident that the Fathers have suitably said that the
   Son is from the Father's essence? considering that it is all one to say
   rightly from God,' and to say from the essence.' For all the creatures,
   though they be said to have come into being from God, yet are not from
   God as the Son is; for they are not offsprings in their nature, but
   works. Thus, it is said, in the beginning God,' not generated,' but
   made the heaven and the earth, and all that is in them' (Gen. i. 1).
   And not, who generates,' but who maketh His angels spirits, and His
   ministers a flame of fire' (Ps. civ. 4). And though the Apostle has
   said, One God, from whom all things' (1 Cor. viii. 6), yet he says not
   this, as reckoning the Son with other things; but, whereas some of the
   Greeks consider that the creation was held together by chance, and from
   the combination of atoms [3611] ; and spontaneously from elements of
   similar structure [3612] , and has no cause; and others consider that
   it came from a cause, but not through the Word; and each heretic has
   imagined things at his will, and tells his fables about the creation;
   on this account the Apostle was obliged to introduce from God,' that he
   might thereby certify the Maker, and shew that the universe was framed
   at His will. And accordingly he straightway proceeds: And one Lord
   Jesus Christ, through whom all things' (1 Cor. viii. 6), by way of
   excepting the Son from that all' (for what is called God's work, is all
   done through the Son; and it is not possible that the things framed
   should have one origin with their Framer), and by way of teaching that
   the phrase of God,' which occurs in the passage, has a different sense
   in the case of the works, from what it bears when used of the Son; for
   He is offspring, and they are works: and therefore He, the Son, is the
   proper offspring of His essence, but they are the handywork of his
   will.

   36. The Council, then, comprehending this [3613] , and aware of the
   different senses of the same word, that none should suppose, that the
   Son was said to be from God' like the creation, wrote with greater
   explicitness, that the Son was from the essence.' For this betokens the
   true genuineness of the Son towards the Father; whereas, by the simple
   phrase from God,' only the Creator's will in framing is signified. If
   then they too had this meaning, when they wrote that the Word was from
   the Father,' they had nothing to complain of in the Council; but if
   they meant of God,' in the instance of the Son, as it is used of the
   creation, then as understanding it of the creation, they should not
   name the Son, or they will be manifestly mingling blasphemy with
   religiousness; but either they have to cease reckoning the Lord with
   the creatures, or at least to refrain from unworthy and unbecoming
   statements about the Son. For if He is a Son, He is not a creature; but
   if a creature, then not a Son. Since these are their views, perhaps
   they will be denying the Holy Laver also, because it is administered
   into Father and into Son and not into Creator and Creature, as they
   account it. But,' they say, all this is not written: and we reject
   these words as unscriptural.' But this, again, is an unblushing excuse
   in their mouths. For if they think everything must be rejected which is
   not written, wherefore, when the Arian party invent such a heap of
   phrases, not from Scripture [3614] , Out of nothing,' and the Son was
   not before His generation,' and Once He was not,' and He is alterable,'
   and the Father is ineffable and invisible to the Son,' and the Son
   knows not even His own essence;' and all that Arius has vomited in his
   light and irreligious Thalia, why do not they speak against these, but
   rather take their part, and on that account contend with their own
   Fathers? And, in what Scripture did they on their part find
   Unoriginate,' and the term essence,' and there are three subsistences,'
   and Christ is not very God,' and He is one of the hundred sheep,' and
   God's Wisdom is ingenerate and without beginning, but the created
   powers are many, of which Christ is one?' Or how, when in the so-called
   Dedication, Acacius and Eusebius and their fellows used expressions not
   in Scripture, and said that the First-born of the creation' was the
   exact Image of the essence and power and will and glory,' do they
   complain of the Fathers, for making mention of unscriptural
   expressions, and especially of essence? For they ought either to
   complain of themselves, or to find no fault with the Fathers.

   37. Now, if certain others made excuses of the expressions of the
   Council, it might perhaps have been set down, either to ignorance or to
   caution. There is no question, for instance, about George of Cappadocia
   [3615] , who was expelled from Alexandria; a man, without character in
   years past, nor a Christian in any respect; but only pretending to the
   name to suit the times, and thinking religion to be a' means of gain'
   (1 Tim. vi. 5). And therefore there is no reason to complain of his
   making mistakes about the faith, considering he knows neither what he
   says, nor whereof he affirms; but, according to the text, goeth after
   all, as a bird' (1 Tim. i. 7; Prov. vii. 22, 23, not LXX.?) But when
   Acacius, and Eudoxius, and Patrophilus say this, do not they deserve
   the strongest reprobation? for while they write what is unscriptural
   themselves, and have accepted many times the term essence' as suitable,
   especially on the ground of the letter [3616] of Eusebius, they now
   blame their predecessors for using terms of the same kind. Nay, though
   they say themselves, that the Son is God from God,' and Living Word,'
   Exact Image of the Father's essence;' they accuse the Nicene Bishops of
   saying, that He who was begotten is of the essence' of Him who begat
   Him, and Coessential' with Him. But what marvel if they conflict with
   their predecessors and their own Fathers, when they are inconsistent
   with themselves, and fall foul of each other? For after publishing, in
   the so-called Dedication at Antioch, that the Son is exact Image of the
   Father's essence, and swearing that so they held and anathematizing
   those who held otherwise, nay, in Isauria, writing down, We do not
   decline the authentic faith published in the Dedication at Antioch
   [3617] ,' where the term essence' was introduced, as if forgetting all
   this, shortly after, in the same Isauria, they put into writing the
   very contrary, saying, We reject the words coessential,' and
   like-in-essence,' as alien to the Scriptures, and abolish the term
   essence,' as not contained therein [3618] .

   38. Can we then any more account such men Christians? or what sort of
   faith have they who stand neither to word nor writing, but alter and
   change every thing according to the times? For if, O Acacius and
   Eudoxius, you do not decline the faith published at the Dedication,'
   and in it is written that the Son is Exact Image of God's essence,' why
   is it ye write in Isauria, we reject the Like in essence?' for if the
   Son is not like the Father according to essence, how is He exact image
   of the essence?' But if you are dissatisfied at having written Exact
   Image of the essence,' how is it that ye anathematize those who say
   that the Son is Unlike?' for if He be not according to essence like, He
   is surely unlike: and the Unlike cannot be an Image. And if so, then it
   does not hold that he that hath seen the Son, hath seen the Father'
   (John xiv. 9), there being then the greatest possible difference
   between Them, or rather the One being wholly Unlike the Other. And
   Unlike cannot possibly be called Like. By what artifice then do you
   call Unlike like, and consider Like to be unlike, and pretend to say
   that the Son is the Father's Image? for if the Son be not like the
   Father in essence, something is wanting to the Image, and it is not a
   complete Image, nor a perfect radiance [3619] . How then read you, In
   Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily?' and, from His
   fulness all we received' (Coloss. ii. 9; John i. 16)? how is it that
   you expel the Arian Aetius as an heretic, though ye say the same with
   him? for he is your companion, O Acacius, and he became Eudoxius's
   master in this so great irreligion [3620] ; which was the reason why
   Leontius the Bishop made him deacon, that using the name of the
   diaconate as sheep's clothing, he might be able with impunity to pour
   forth the words of blasphemy.

   39. What then has persuaded you to contradict each other, and to
   procure to yourselves so great a disgrace? You cannot give any good
   account of it; this supposition only remains, that all you do is but
   outward profession and pretence, to secure the patronage of Constantius
   and the gain from thence accruing. And ye make nothing of accusing the
   Fathers, and ye complain outright of the expressions as being
   unscriptural; and, as it is written, opened your legs to every one that
   passed by' (Ez. xvi. 25); so as to change as often as they wish, in
   whose pay and keep you are. Yet, though a man use terms not in
   Scripture, it makes no difference so that his meaning be religious
   [3621] . But the heretic, though he use scriptural terms, yet, as being
   equally dangerous and depraved, shall be asked in the words of the
   Spirit, Why dost thou preach My laws, and takest My covenant in thy
   mouth' (Ps. l. 16)? Thus whereas the devil, though speaking from the
   Scriptures, is silenced by the Saviour, the blessed Paul, though he
   speaks from profane writers, The Cretans are always liars,' and, For we
   are His offspring,' and, Evil communications corrupt good manners,' yet
   has a religious meaning, as being holy,--is doctor of the nations, in
   faith and verity,' as having the mind of Christ' (Tit. i. 12; Acts
   xvii. 28; 1 Cor. xv. 33; 1 Tim. ii. 7; 1 Cor. ii. 16), and what he
   speaks, he utters religiously. What then is there even plausible, in
   the Arian terms, in which the caterpillar' (Joel ii. 25) and the
   locust' are preferred to the Saviour, and He is reviled with Once Thou
   wast not,' and Thou wast created,' and Thou art foreign to God in
   essence,' and, in a word, no irreverence is unused among them? But what
   did the Fathers omit in the way of reverence? or rather, have they not
   a lofty view and a Christ-loving religiousness? And yet these, they
   wrote, We reject;' while those others they endure in their insults
   towards the Lord, and betray to all men, that for no other cause do
   they resist that great Council but that it condemned the Arian heresy.
   For it is on this account again that they speak against the term
   Coessential, about which they also entertain wrong sentiments. For if
   their faith was right, and they confessed the Father as truly Father,
   believed the Son to be genuine Son, and by nature true Word and Wisdom
   of the Father, and as to saying that the Son is from God,' if they did
   not use the words of Him, as of themselves, but understood Him to be
   the proper offspring of the Father's essence, as the radiance is from
   light, they would not every one of them have found fault with the
   Fathers; but would have been confident that the Council wrote suitably;
   and that this is the right faith concerning our Lord Jesus Christ.

   40. But,' say they, the sense of such expressions is obscure to us;'
   for this is another of their pretences,--We reject them [3622] ,' say
   they, because we cannot master their meaning.' But if they were true in
   this profession, instead of saying, We reject them,' they should ask
   instruction from the well informed; else ought they to reject whatever
   they cannot understand in divine Scripture, and to find fault with the
   writers. But this were the venture of heretics rather than of us
   Christians; for what we do not understand in the sacred oracles,
   instead of rejecting, we seek from persons to whom the Lord has
   revealed it, and from them we ask for instruction. But since they thus
   make a pretence of the obscurity of such expressions, let them at least
   confess what is annexed to the Creed, and anathematize those who hold
   that the Son is from nothing,' and He was not before His generation,'
   and the Word of God is a creature and work,' and He is alterable by
   nature,' and from another subsistence;' and in a word let them
   anathematize the Arian heresy, which has originated such irreligion.
   Nor let them say any more, We reject the terms,' but that we do not yet
   understand them;' by way of having some reason to shew for declining
   them. But I know well, and am sure, and they know it too, that if they
   could confess all this and anathematize the Arian heresy, they would no
   longer deny those terms of the Council. For on this account it was that
   the Fathers, after declaring that the Son was begotten from the
   Father's essence, and Co-essential with Him, thereupon added, But those
   who say'--what has just been quoted, the symbols of the Arian
   heresy,--we anathematize;' I mean, in order to shew that the statements
   are parallel, and that the terms in the Creed imply the disclaimers
   subjoined, and that all who confess the terms, will certainly
   understand the disclaimers. But those who both dissent from the latter
   and impugn the former, such men are proved on every side to be foes of
   Christ.

   41. Those who deny the Council altogether, are sufficiently exposed by
   these brief remarks; those, however, who accept everything else that
   was defined at NicÃ¦a, and doubt only about the Coessential, must not be
   treated as enemies; nor do we here attack them as Ario-maniacs, nor as
   opponents of the Fathers, but we discuss the matter with them as
   brothers with brothers [3623] , who mean what we mean, and dispute only
   about the word. For, confessing that the Son is from the essence of the
   Father, and not from other subsistence, and that He is not a creature
   nor work, but His genuine and natural offspring, and that He is
   eternally with the Father as being His Word and Wisdom, they are not
   far from accepting even the phrase, Coessential.' Now such is Basil,
   who wrote from Ancyra concerning the faith [3624] . For only to say
   like according to essence,' is very far from signifying of the
   essence,' by which, rather, as they say themselves, the genuineness of
   the Son to the Father is signified. Thus tin is only like to silver, a
   wolf to a dog, and gilt brass to the true metal; but tin is not from
   silver, nor could a wolf be accounted the offspring of a dog. [3625]
   But since they say that He is of the essence' and Like-in-essence,'
   what do they signify by these but Coessential [3626] ?' For, while to
   say only Like-in-essence,' does not necessarily convey of the essence,'
   on the contrary, to say Coessential,' is to signify the meaning of both
   terms, Like-in-essence,' and of the essence.' And accordingly they
   themselves in controversy with those who say that the Word is a
   creature, instead of allowing Him to be genuine Son, have taken their
   proofs against them from human illustrations of son and father [3627] ,
   with this exception that God is not as man, nor the generation of the
   Son as issue of man, but such as may be ascribed to God, and is fit for
   us to think. Thus they have called the Father the Fount of Wisdom and
   Life, and the Son the Radiance of the Eternal Light, and the Offspring
   from the Fountain, as He says, I am the Life,' and, I Wisdom dwell with
   Prudence' (John xiv. 6; Prov. viii. 12). But the Radiance from the
   Light, and Offspring from Fountain, and Son from Father, how can these
   be so fitly expressed as by Coessential?' And is there any cause of
   fear, lest, because the offspring from men are coessential, the Son, by
   being called Coessential, be Himself considered as a human offspring
   too? perish the thought! not so; but the explanation is easy. For the
   Son is the Father's Word and Wisdom; whence we learn the impassibility
   and indivisibility of such a generation from the Father [3628] . For
   not even man's word is part of him, nor proceeds from him according to
   passion [3629] ; much less God's Word; whom the Father has declared to
   be His own Son, lest, on the other hand, if we merely heard of Word,'
   we should suppose Him, such as is the word of man, impersonal; but
   that, hearing that He is Son, we may acknowledge Him to be living Word
   and substantive Wisdom.

   42. Accordingly, as in saying offspring,' we have no human thoughts,
   and, though we know God to be a Father, we entertain no material ideas
   concerning Him, but while we listen to these illustrations and terms,
   we think suitably of God, for He is not as man, so in like manner, when
   we hear of coessential,' we ought to transcend all sense, and,
   according to the Proverb, understand by the understanding what is set
   before us' (Prov. xxiii. 1); so as to know, that not by will, but in
   truth, is He genuine from the Father, as Life from Fountain, and
   Radiance from Light. Else [3630] why should we understand offspring'
   and son,' in no corporeal way, while we conceive of coessential' as
   after the manner of bodies? especially since these terms are not here
   used about different subjects, but of whom offspring' is predicated, of
   Him is coessential' also. And it is but consistent to attach the same
   sense to both expressions as applied to the Saviour, and not to
   interpret offspring' in a good sense, and coessential' otherwise; since
   to be consistent, ye who are thus minded and who say that the Son is
   Word and Wisdom of the Father, should entertain a different view of
   these terms also, and understand Word in another sense, and Wisdom in
   yet another. But, as this would be absurd (for the Son is the Father's
   Word and Wisdom, and the Offspring from the Father is one and proper to
   His essence), so the sense of Offspring' and Coessential' is one, and
   whoso considers the Son an offspring, rightly considers Him also as
   coessential.'

   43. This is sufficient to shew that the meaning of the beloved ones
   [3631] is not foreign nor far from the Coessential.' But since, as they
   allege [3632] (for I have not the Epistle in question), the Bishops who
   condemned the Samosatene [3633] have said in writing that the Son is
   not coessential with the Father, and so it comes to pass that they, for
   caution and honour towards those who have so said, thus feel about that
   expression, it will be to the purpose cautiously to argue with them
   this point also. Certainly it is unbecoming to make the one conflict
   with the others; for all are fathers; nor is it religious to settle,
   that these have spoken well, and those ill; for all of them fell asleep
   in Christ. Nor is it right to be disputatious, and to compare the
   respective numbers of those who met in the Councils, lest the three
   hundred seem to throw the lesser into the shade; nor to compare the
   dates, lest those who preceded seem to eclipse those that came after.
   For all, I say, are fathers; and yet not even the three hundred laid
   down nothing new, nor was it in any self-confidence that they became
   champions of words not in Scripture, but they fell back upon fathers,
   as did the others, and used their words. For there have been two of the
   name of Dionysius, much older than the seventy who deposed the
   Samosatene, of whom one was of Rome, and the other of Alexandria. But a
   charge had been laid by some persons against the Bishop of Alexandria
   before the Bishop of Rome, as if he had said that the Son was made, and
   not coessential with the Father. And, the synod at Rome being
   indignant, the Bishop of Rome expressed their united sentiments in a
   letter to his namesake. And so the latter, in defence, wrote a book
   with the title of Refutation and Defence;' and thus he writes to the
   other:

   44. And [3634] I wrote in another Letter a refutation of the false
   charge which they bring against me, that I deny that Christ is
   coessential with God. For though I say that I have not found or read
   this term anywhere in holy Scripture, yet my remarks which follow, and
   which they have not noticed, are not inconsistent with that belief. For
   I instanced a human production, which is evidently homogeneous, and I
   observed that undeniably fathers differed from their children, only in
   not being the same individuals; otherwise there could be neither
   parents nor children. And my Letter, as I said before, owing to present
   circumstances, I am unable to produce, or I would have sent you the
   very words I used, or rather a copy of it all; which, if I have an
   opportunity, I will do still. But I am sure from recollection, that I
   adduced many parallels of things kindred with each other, for instance,
   that a plant grown from seed or from root, was other than that from
   which it sprang, and yet altogether one in nature with it; and that a
   stream flowing from a fountain, changed its appearance and its name,
   for that neither the fountain was called stream, nor the stream
   fountain, but both existed, and that the fountain was as it were
   father, but the stream was what was generated from the fountain.

   45. Thus the Bishop. If then any one finds fault with those who met at
   NicÃ¦a, as if they contradicted the decisions of their predecessors, he
   might reasonably find fault also with the seventy, because they did not
   keep to the statements of their own predecessors; but such were the
   Dionysii and the Bishops assembled on that occasion at Rome. But
   neither these nor those is it pious to blame; for all were charged with
   the embassy of Christ, and all have given diligence against the
   heretics, and the one party condemned the Samosatene, while the other
   condemned the Arian heresy. And rightly have both these and those
   written, and suitably to the matter in hand. And as the blessed
   Apostle, writing to the Romans, said, The Law is spiritual, the Law is
   holy, and the commandment holy and just and good' (Rom. vii. 14, 12);
   and soon after, What the Law could not do, in that it was weak' (ib.
   viii. 3), but wrote to the Hebrews, The Law has made no one perfect'
   (Heb. vii. 19); and to the Galatians, By the Law no one is justified'
   (Gal. iii. 11), but to Timothy, The Law is good, if a man use it
   lawfully' (1 Tim. i. 8); and no one would accuse the Saint of
   inconsistency and variation in writing, but rather would admire how
   suitably he wrote to each, to teach the Romans and the others to turn
   from the letter to the spirit, but to instruct the Hebrews and
   Galatians to place their hopes, not in the Law, but in the Lord who had
   given the Law;--so, if the Fathers of the two Councils made different
   mention of the Coessential, we ought not in any respect to differ from
   them, but to investigate their meaning, and this will fully show us the
   agreement of both the Councils. For they who deposed the Samosatene
   took Coessential in a bodily sense, because Paul had attempted
   sophistry and said, Unless Christ has of man become God, it follows
   that He is Coessential with the Father; and if so, of necessity there
   are three essences, one the previous essence, and the other two from
   it;' and therefore guarding against this they said with good reason,
   that Christ was not Coessential [3635] . For the Son is not related to
   the Father as he imagined. But the Bishops who anathematized the Arian
   heresy, understanding Paul's craft, and reflecting that the word
   Coessential' has not this meaning when used of things immaterial [3636]
   , and especially of God, and acknowledging that the Word was not a
   creature, but an offspring from the essence, and that the Father's
   essence was the origin and root and fountain of the Son, and that he
   was of very truth His Father's likeness, and not of different nature,
   as we are, and separate from the Father, but that, as being from Him,
   He exists as Son indivisible, as radiance is with respect to Light, and
   knowing too the illustrations used in Dionysius's case, the fountain,'
   and the defence of Coessential' and before this the Saviour's saying,
   symbolical of unity [3637] , I and the Father are one' and he that hath
   seen Me hath seen the Father' (John x. 30; xiv. 9), on these grounds
   reasonably asserted on their part, that the Son was Coessential. And
   as, according to a former remark, no one would blame the Apostle, if he
   wrote to the Romans about the Law in one way, and to the Hebrews in
   another; in like manner, neither would the present Bishops find fault
   with the ancient, having regard to their interpretation, nor again in
   view of theirs and of the need of their so writing about the Lord,
   would the ancient censure their successors. Yes surely, each Council
   has a sufficient reason for its own language; for since the Samosatene
   held that the Son was not before Mary, but received from her the origin
   of His being, therefore those who then met deposed him and pronounced
   him heretic; but concerning the Son's Godhead writing in simplicity,
   they arrived not at accuracy concerning the Coessential, but, as they
   understood the word, so spoke they about it. For they directed all
   their thoughts to destroy the device of the Samosatene, and to shew
   that the Son was before all things, and that, instead of becoming God
   from man, He, being God, had put on a servant's form, and being Word,
   had become flesh, as John says (Phil. ii. 7; Joh. i. 14). This is how
   they dealt with the blasphemies of Paul; but when Eusebius, Arius, and
   their fellows said that though the Son was before time, yet was He made
   and one of the creatures, and as to the phrase from God,' they did not
   believe it in the sense of His being genuine Son from Father, but
   maintained it as it is said of the creatures, and as to the oneness
   [3638] of likeness [3639] between the Son and the Father, did not
   confess that the Son is like the Father according to essence, or
   according to nature as a son resembles his father, but because of Their
   agreement of doctrines and of teaching [3640] ; nay, when they drew a
   line and an utter distinction between the Son's essence and the Father,
   ascribing to Him an origin of being, other than the Father, and
   degrading Him to the creatures, on this account the Bishops assembled
   at NicÃ¦a, with a view to the craft of the parties so thinking, and as
   bringing together the sense from the Scriptures, cleared up the point,
   by affirming the Coessential;' that both the true genuineness of the
   Son might thereby be known, and that to things originate might be
   ascribed nothing in common with Him. For the precision of this phrase
   detects their pretence, whenever they use the phrase from God,' and
   gets rid of all the subtleties with which they seduce the simple. For
   whereas they contrive to put a sophistical construction on all other
   words at their will, this phrase only, as detecting their heresy, do
   they dread; which the Fathers set down as a bulwark [3641] against
   their irreligious notions one and all.

   46. Let then all contention cease, nor let us any longer conflict,
   though the Councils have differently taken the phrase Coessential,' for
   we have already assigned a sufficient defence of them; and to it the
   following may be added:--We have not derived the word Unoriginate' from
   Scripture, (for no where does Scripture call God Unoriginate,) yet
   since it has many authorities in its favour, I was curious about the
   term, and found that it too has different senses [3642] . Some, for
   instance, call what is, but is neither generated, nor has any personal
   cause at all, unoriginate; and others, the uncreate. As then a person,
   having in view the former of these senses, viz. that which has no
   personal cause,' might say that the Son was not unoriginate, yet would
   not blame any one whom he perceived to have in view the other meaning,
   not a work or creature but an eternal offspring,' and to affirm
   accordingly that the Son was unoriginate, (for both speak suitably with
   a view to their own object); so, even granting that the Fathers have
   spoken variously concerning the Coessential, let us not dispute about
   it, but take what they deliver to us in a religious way, when
   especially their anxiety was directed in behalf of religion.

   47. Ignatius, for instance, who was appointed Bishop in Antioch after
   the Apostles, and became a martyr of Christ, writes concerning the Lord
   thus: There is one physician, fleshly and spiritual, originate and
   unoriginate [3643] ,' God in man, true life in death, both from Mary
   and from God;' whereas some teachers who followed Ignatius, write in
   their turn, One is the Unoriginate, the Father, and one the genuine Son
   from Him, true offspring, Word and Wisdom of the Father [3644] .' If
   therefore we have hostile feelings towards these writers, then have we
   right to quarrel with the Councils; but if, knowing their faith in
   Christ, we are persuaded that the blessed Ignatius was right in writing
   that Christ was originate on account of the flesh (for He became
   flesh), yet unoriginate, because He is not in the number of things made
   and originated, but Son from Father; and if we are aware too that those
   who have said that the Unoriginate is One, meaning the Father, did not
   mean to lay down that the Word was originated and made, but that the
   Father has no personal cause, but rather is Himself Father of Wisdom,
   and in Wisdom has made all things that are originated; why do we not
   combine all our Fathers in religious belief, those who deposed the
   Samosatene as well as those who proscribed the Arian heresy, instead of
   making distinctions between them and refusing to entertain a right
   opinion of them? I repeat, that those, in view of the sophistical
   explanation of the Samosatene, wrote, He is not coessential [3645] ;'
   and these, with an apposite meaning, said that He was. For myself, I
   have written these brief remarks, from my feeling towards persons who
   were religious to Christ-ward; but were it possible to come by the
   Epistle which we are told that the former wrote, I consider we should
   find further grounds for the aforesaid proceeding of those blessed men.
   For it is right and meet thus to feel, and to maintain a good
   conscience toward the Fathers, if we be not spurious children, but have
   received the traditions from them, and the lessons of religion at their
   hands.

   48. Such then, as we confess and believe, being the sense of the
   Fathers, proceed we even in their company to examine once more the
   matter, calmly and with a kindly sympathy, with reference to what has
   been said before, viz. whether the Bishops collected at NicÃ¦a do not
   really prove to have thought aright. For if the Word be a work and
   foreign to the Father's essence, so that He is separated from the
   Father by the difference of nature, He cannot be one in essence with
   Him, but rather He is homogeneous by nature with the works, though He
   surpass them in grace [3646] . On the other hand, if we confess that He
   is not a work but the genuine offspring of the Father's essence, it
   would follow that He is inseparable from the Father, being connatural,
   because He is begotten from Him. And being such, good reason He should
   be called Coessential. Next, if the Son be not such from participation,
   but is in His essence the Father's Word and Wisdom, and this essence is
   the offspring of the Father's essence [3647] , and its likeness as the
   radiance is of the light, and the Son says, I and the Father are One,'
   and, he that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father' (John x. 30; xiv. 9),
   how must we understand these words? or how shall we so explain them as
   to preserve the oneness of the Father and the Son? Now as to its
   consisting in agreement [3648] of doctrines, and in the Son's not
   disagreeing with the Father, as the Arians say, such an interpretation
   is a sorry one; for both the Saints, and still more Angels and
   Archangels, have such an agreement with God, and there is no
   disagreement among them. For he who disagreed, the devil, was beheld to
   fall from the heavens, as the Lord said. Therefore if by reason of
   agreement the Father and the Son are one, there would be things
   originated which had this agreement with God, and each of these might
   say, I and the Father are One.' But if this be absurd, and so it truly
   is, it follows of necessity that we must conceive of Son's and Father's
   oneness in the way of essence. For things originate, though they have
   an agreement with their Maker, yet possess it only by influence [3649]
   , and by participation, and through the mind; the transgression of
   which forfeits heaven. But the Son, being an offspring from the
   essence, is one by essence, Himself and the Father that begat Him.

   49. This is why He has equality with the Father by titles expressive of
   unity [3650] , and what is said of the Father, is said in Scripture of
   the Son also, all but His being called Father [3651] . For the Son
   Himself said, All things that the Father hath are Mine' (John xvi. 15);
   and He says to the Father, All Mine are Thine, and Thine are Mine'
   (John xvii. 10),--as for instance [3652] , the name God; for the Word
   was God;'--Almighty, Thus saith He that is, and that was, and that is
   to come, the Almighty' (John i. 1; Apoc. i. 8):--the being Light, I
   am,' He says, the Light' (John viii. 12):--the Operative Cause, All
   things were made by Him,' and, whatsoever I see the Father do, I do
   also' (John i. 3; v. 19):--the being Everlasting, His eternal power and
   godhead,' and, In the beginning was the Word,' and, He was the true
   Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world;'--the being
   Lord, for, The Lord rained fire and brimstone from the Lord,' and the
   Father says, I am the Lord,' and, Thus saith the Lord, the Almighty
   God;' and of the Son Paul speaks thus, One Lord Jesus Christ, through
   whom all things' (Rom. i. 20; John i. 1, 9; Gen. xix. 24; Isa. xlv. 5;
   Am. v. 16; 1 Cor. viii. 6). And on the Father Angels wait, and again
   the Son too is worshipped by them, And let all the Angels of God
   worship Him;' and He is said to be Lord of Angels, for the Angels
   ministered unto Him,' and the Son of Man shall send His Angels.' The
   being honoured as the Father, for that they may honour the Son,' He
   says, as they honour the Father;'--being equal to God, He counted it
   not a prize to be equal with God' (Heb. i. 6; Matt. iv. 11; xxiv. 31;
   John v. 23; Phil. ii. 6):-- the being Truth from the True, and Life
   from the Living, as being truly from the Fountain, even the
   Father;--the quickening and raising the dead as the Father, for so it
   is written in the Gospel. And of the Father it is written, The Lord thy
   God is One Lord,' and, The God of gods, the Lord, hath spoken, and hath
   called the earth;' and of the Son, The Lord God hath shined upon us,'
   and, The God of gods shall be seen in Sion.' And again of God, Isaiah
   says, Who is a God like unto Thee, taking away iniquities and passing
   over unrighteousness?' (Deut. vi. 4; Ps. l. 1; cxviii. 27; lxxxiv. 7,
   LXX.; Mic. vii. 18). But the Son said to whom He would, Thy sins are
   forgiven thee;' for instance, when, on the Jews murmuring, He
   manifested the remission by His act, saying to the paralytic, Rise,
   take up thy bed, and go unto thy house.' And of God Paul says, To the
   King eternal;' and again of the Son, David in the Psalm, Lift up your
   gates, O ye rulers, and be ye lift up ye everlasting doors, and the
   King of glory shall come in.' And Daniel heard it said, His Kingdom is
   an everlasting Kingdom, and His Kingdom shall not be destroyed' (Matt.
   ix. 5; Mark ii. 11; 1 Tim. i. 17; Ps. xxiv. 7; Dan. iv. 3; vii. 14).
   And in a word, all that you find said of the Father, so much will you
   find said of the Son, all but His being Father, as has been said.

   50. If then any think of other beginning, and other Father, considering
   the equality of these attributes, it is a mad thought. But if, since
   the Son is from the Father, all that is the Father's is the Son's as in
   an image and Expression, let it be considered dispassionately, whether
   an essence foreign from the Father's essence admit of such attributes;
   and whether such a one be other in nature and alien in essence, and not
   coessential with the Father. For we must take reverent heed, lest
   transferring what is proper to the Father to what is unlike Him in
   essence, and expressing the Father's godhead by what is unlike in kind
   and alien in essence, we introduce another essence foreign to Him, yet
   capable of the properties of the first essence [3653] , and lest we be
   silenced by God Himself, saying, My glory I will not give to another,'
   and be discovered worshipping this alien God, and be accounted such as
   were the Jews of that day, who said, Wherefore dost Thou, being a man,
   make Thyself God?' referring, the while, to another source the things
   of the Spirit, and blasphemously saying, He casteth out devils through
   Beelzebub' (Isa. xlii. 8; John x. 33; Luke xi. 15). But if this is
   shocking, plainly the Son is not unlike in essence, but coessential
   with the Father; for if what the Father has is by nature the Son's, and
   the Son Himself is from the Father, and because of this oneness of
   godhead and of nature He and the Father are one, and He that hath seen
   the Son hath seen the Father, reasonably is He called by the Fathers
   Coessential;' for to what is other in essence, it belongs not to
   possess such prerogatives.

   51. And again, if, as we have said before, the Son is not such by
   participation, but, while all things originated have by participation
   the grace of God, He is the Father's Wisdom and Word of which all
   things partake [3654] , it follows that He, being the deifying and
   enlightening power of the Father, in which all things are deified and
   quickened, is not alien in essence from the Father, but coessential.
   For by partaking of Him, we partake of the Father; because that the
   Word is the Father's own. Whence, if He was Himself too from
   participation, and not from the Father His essential Godhead and Image,
   He would not deify [3655] , being deified Himself. For it is not
   possible that He, who merely possesses from participation, should
   impart of that partaking to others, since what He has is not His own,
   but the Giver's; and what He has received, is barely the grace
   sufficient for Himself. However, let us fairly examine the reason why
   some, as is said, decline the Coessential,' whether it does not rather
   shew that the Son is coessential with the Father. They say then, as you
   have written, that it is not right to say that the Son is coessential
   with the Father, because he who speaks of coessential' speaks of three,
   one essence pre-existing, and that those who are generated from it are
   coessential: and they add, If then the Son be coessential with the
   Father, then an essence must be previously supposed, from which they
   have been generated; and that the One is not Father and the Other Son,
   but they are brothers together. [3656] ' As to all this, though it be a
   Greek interpretation, and what comes from them does not bind us [3657]
   , still let us see whether those things which are called coessential
   and are collateral, as derived from one essence presupposed, are
   coessential with each other, or with the essence from which they are
   generated. For if only with each other, then are they other in essence
   and unlike, when referred to that essence which generated them; for
   other in essence is opposed to coessential; but if each be coessential
   with the essence which generated them, it is thereby confessed that
   what is generated from any thing, is coessential with that which
   generated it; and there is no need of seeking for three essences, but
   merely to seek whether it be true that this is from that [3658] . For
   should it happen that there were not two brothers, but that only one
   had come of that essence, he that was generated would not be called
   alien in essence, merely because there was no other from the essence
   than he; but though alone, he must be coessential with him that begat
   him. For what shall we say about Jephtha's daughter; because she was
   only-begotten, and he had not,' says Scripture, other child' (Jud. xi.
   34); and again, concerning the widow's son, whom the Lord raised from
   the dead, because he too had no brother, but was only-begotten, was on
   that account neither of these coessential with him that begat? Surely
   they were, for they were children, and this is a property of children
   with reference to their parents. And in like manner also, when the
   Fathers said that the Son of God was from His essence, reasonably have
   they spoken of Him as coessential. For the like property has the
   radiance compared with the light. Else it follows that not even the
   creation came out of nothing. For whereas men beget with passion [3659]
   , so again they work upon an existing subject matter, and otherwise
   cannot make. But if we do not understand creation in a human way [3660]
   , when we attribute it to God, much less seemly is it to understand
   generation in a human way, or to give a corporeal sense to Coessential;
   instead of receding from things originate, casting away human images,
   nay, all things sensible, and ascending [3661] to the Father [3662] ,
   lest we rob the Father of the Son in ignorance, and rank Him among His
   own creatures.

   52. Further, if, in confessing Father and Son, we spoke of two
   beginnings or two Gods as Marcion and Valentinus [3663] , or said that
   the Son had any other mode of godhead, and was not the Image and
   Expression of the Father, as being by nature born from Him, then He
   might be considered unlike; for such essences are altogether unlike
   each other. But if we acknowledge that the Father's godhead is one and
   sole, and that of Him the Son is the Word and Wisdom; and, as thus
   believing, are far from speaking of two Gods, but understand the
   oneness of the Son with the Father to be, not in likeness of their
   teaching, but according to essence and in truth, and hence speak not of
   two Gods but of one God; there being but one Form [3664] of Godhead, as
   the Light is one and the Radiance; (for this was seen by the Patriarch
   Jacob, as Scripture says, The sun rose upon him when the Form of God
   passed by,' Gen. xxxii. 31, LXX.); and beholding this, and
   understanding of whom He was Son and Image, the holy Prophets say, The
   Word of the Lord came to me;' and recognising the Father, who was
   beheld and revealed in Him, they made bold to say, The God of our
   fathers hath appeared unto me, the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and
   Jacob' (Exod. iii. 16); this being so, wherefore scruple we to call Him
   coessential who is one with the Father, and appears as doth the Father,
   according to likeness and oneness of godhead? For if, as has been many
   times said, He has it not to be proper to the Father's essence, nor to
   resemble, as a Son, we may well scruple: but if this be the
   illuminating and creative Power, specially proper to the Father,
   without Whom He neither frames nor is known (for all things consist
   through Him and in Him); wherefore, perceiving the fact, do we decline
   to use the phrase conveying it? For what is it to be thus connatural
   with the Father, but to be one in essence with Him? for God attached
   not to Him the Son from without [3665] , as needing a servant; nor are
   the works on a level with the Creator, and honoured as He is, or to be
   thought one with the Father. Or let a man venture to make the
   distinction, that the sun and the radiance are two lights, or different
   essences; or to say that the radiance accrued to it over and above, and
   is not a simple and pure offspring from the sun; such, that sun and
   radiance are two, but the light one, because the radiance is an
   offspring from the Sun. But, whereas not more divisible, nay less
   divisible is the nature [3666] of the Son towards the Father, and the
   godhead not accruing to the Son, but the Father's godhead being in the
   Son, so that he that hath seen the Son hath seen the Father in Him;
   wherefore should not such a one be called Coessential?

   53. Even this is sufficient to dissuade you from blaming those who have
   said that the Son was coessential with the Father, and yet let us
   examine the very term Coessential,' in itself, by way of seeing whether
   we ought to use it at all, and whether it be a proper term, and is
   suitable to apply to the Son. For you know yourselves, and no one can
   dispute it, that Like is not predicated of essence, but of habits, and
   qualities; for in the case of essences we speak, not of likeness, but
   of identity. Man, for instance, is said to be like man, not in essence,
   but according to habit and character; for in essence men are of one
   nature. And again, man is not said to be unlike dog, but to be of
   different nature. Accordingly while the former are of one nature and
   coessential, the latter are different in both. Therefore, in speaking
   of Like according to essence, we mean like by participation; (for
   Likeness is a quality, which may attach to essence), and this would be
   proper to creatures for they, by partaking, are made like to God. For
   when He shall appear,' says Scripture, we shall be like Him' (1 John
   iii. 2), like, that is, not in essence but in sonship, which we shall
   partake from Him. If then ye speak of the Son as being by
   participation, then indeed call Him Like-in-essence; but thus spoken
   of, He is not Truth, nor Light at all, nor in nature God. For things
   which are from participation, are called like, not in reality, but from
   resemblance to reality; so that they may swerve, or be taken from those
   who share them. And this, again, is proper to creatures and works.
   Therefore, if this be out of place, He must be, not by participation,
   but in nature and truth Son, Light, Wisdom, God; and being by nature,
   and not by sharing, He would properly be called, not Like-in-essence,
   but Coessential. But what would not be asserted, even in the case of
   others (for the Like has been shewn to be inapplicable to essences), is
   it not folly, not to say violence, to put forward in the case of the
   Son, instead of the Coessential?'

   54. This is why the Nicene Council was correct in writing, what it was
   becoming to say, that the Son, begotten from the Father's essence, is
   coessential with Him. And if we too have been taught the same thing,
   let us not fight with shadows, especially as knowing, that they who
   have so defined, have made this confession of faith, not to
   misrepresent the truth, but as vindicating the truth and religiousness
   towards Christ, and also as destroying the blasphemies against Him of
   the Ario-maniacs. For this must be considered and noted carefully,
   that, in using unlike-in-essence, and other-in-essence, we signify not
   the true Son, but some one of the creatures, and an introduced and
   adopted Son, which pleases the heretics; but when we speak
   uncontroversially of the Coessential, we signify a genuine Son born of
   the Father; though at this Christ's enemies often burst with rage
   [3667] . What then I have learned myself, and have heard men of
   judgment say, I have written in few words; but do you, remaining on the
   foundation of the Apostles, and holding fast the traditions of the
   Fathers, pray that now at length all strife and rivalry may cease, and
   the futile questions of the heretics may be condemned, and all
   logomachy [3668] ; and the guilty and murderous heresy of the Arians
   may disappear, and the truth may shine again in the hearts of all, so
   that all every where may say the same thing' (1 Cor. i. 10), and think
   the same thing [3669] , and that, no Arian contumelies remaining, it
   may be said and confessed in every Church, One Lord, one faith, one
   baptism' (Eph. iv. 5), in Christ Jesus our Lord, through whom to the
   Father be the glory and the strength, unto ages of ages. Amen.

   Postscript.

   55. After I had written my account of the Councils [3670] , I had
   information that the most irreligious [3671] Constantius had sent
   Letters to the Bishops remaining in Ariminum; and I have taken pains to
   get copies of them from true brethren and to send them to you, and also
   what the Bishops answered; that you may know the irreligious craft of
   the Emperor, and the firm and unswerving purpose of the Bishops towards
   the truth.

   Interpretation of the Letter [3672] .

   Constantius, Victorious and Triumphant, Augustus, to all Bishops who
   are assembled at Ariminum.

   That the divine and adorable Law is our chief care, your excellencies
   are not ignorant; but as yet we have been unable to receive the twenty
   Bishops sent by your wisdom, and charged with the legation from you,
   for we are pressed by a necessary expedition against the Barbarians;
   and as ye know, it beseems to have the soul clear from every care, when
   one handles the matters of the Divine Law. Therefore we have ordered
   the Bishops to await our return at Adrianople; that, when all public
   affairs are well arranged, then at length we may hear and weigh their
   suggestions. Let it not then be grievous to your constancy to await
   their return, that, when they come back with our answer to you, ye may
   be able to bring matters to a close which so deeply affect the
   well-being of the Catholic Church.

   This was what the Bishops received at the hands of three emissaries.

   Reply of the Bishops.

   The letter of your humanity we have received, most God-beloved Lord
   Emperor, which reports that, on account of stress of public affairs, as
   yet you have been unable to attend to our deputies; and in which you
   command us to await their return, until your godliness shall be advised
   by them of what we have defined conformably to our ancestors. However,
   we now profess and aver at once by these presents, that we shall not
   recede from our purpose, as we also instructed our deputies. We ask
   then that you will with serene countenance command these letters of our
   mediocrity to be read; but also that you will graciously receive those,
   with which we charged our deputies. This however your gentleness
   comprehends as well as we, that great grief and sadness at present
   prevail, because that, in these your most happy days, so many Churches
   are without Bishops. And on this account we again request your
   humanity, most God-beloved Lord Emperor, that, if it please your
   religiousness, you would command us, before the severe winter weather
   sets in, to return to our Churches, that so we may be able, unto God
   Almighty and our Lord and Saviour Christ, His Only-begotten Son, to
   fulfil together with our flocks our wonted prayers in behalf of your
   imperial sway, as indeed we have ever performed them, and at this time
   make them.

   Additional Note.

   The list of Sirmian confessions' published by Newman as an Excursus to
   the de Synodis is omitted here. It will be found printed as Appendix
   iii.' to his Arians of the Fourth Century.

   The Excursus on a Creed ascribed (at the Council of Ephesus, see Hard.
   Conc. i. 1640, Hahn. Â§83; Routh Rell. iii. 367) to the 70 bishops who
   condemned Paul of Samosata, at Antioch a.d. 269, and containing the
   formula homoousion (against this, supr. Â§Â§43-47), is also omitted, as
   bearing only very indirectly on the de Synodis. Caspari Alte und Neue
   Quellen (xi), p. 161, has thoroughly investigated the Confession since
   Newman wrote, and has proved (what Newman half suspected) that the
   document is of Apollinarian origin. As Caspari was unaware of Newman's
   discussion, this result comes as the result of two independent
   investigations pursued on very different lines.]

   [3603] The subject before us, naturally rises out of what has gone
   before. The Anomoean creed was hopeless; but with the Semi-Arians all
   that remained was the adjustment of phrases. Accordingly, Athan. goes
   on to propose such explanations as might clear the way for a re-union
   of Christendom. Â§47, note.

   [3627] Here at last Athan. alludes to the Ancyrene Synodal Letter, vid.
   Epiph. HÃ¦r. 73, 5 and 7. about which he has kept a pointed silence
   above, when tracing the course of the Arian confessions. That is, he
   treats the Semi-Arians as tenderly as S. Hilary, as soon as they break
   company with the Arians. The Ancyrene Council of 358 was a protest
   against the blasphemia' or second Sirmian Confession

   [3628] It is usual with the Fathers to use the two terms Son' and
   Word,' to guard and complete the ordinary sense of each other, vid. p.
   157, note 6; and p. 167, note 4. The term Son, used by itself, was
   abused into Arianism; and the term Word into Sabellianism; again the
   term Son might be accused of introducing material notions, and the term
   Word of imperfection and transitoriness. Each of them corrected the
   other. Orat. i. Â§28. iv. Â§8. Euseb. contr. Marc. ii. 4. p. 54. Isid.

   Athanasius observes, that properly speaking the one term implies the
   other, i.e. in its fulness. Orat. iii. Â§3. iv. Â§24 fin. On the other
   hand the heretics accused Catholics of inconsistency, or of a union of
   opposite errors, because they accepted all the Scripture images
   together. Vigilius of Thapsus, contr. Eutych. ii. init. vid. also i.

   dates of 264, 269, and an intermediate year. The third is spoken of in
   the text, which contrary to the opinion of Pagi, S. Basnage, and
   Tillemont, Pearson fixes at 265 or 266.

   [3635] This is in fact the objection which Arius urges against the
   Coessential, supr. Â§16, when he calls it the doctrine of ManichÃ¦us and
   Hieracas, vid. Â§16, note 11. The same objection is protested against by
   S. Basil, contr. Eunom. i. 19. Hilar. de Trin. iv. 4. Yet, while S.
   Basil agrees with Athan. in his account of the reason of the Council's
   rejection of the word, S. Hilary on the contrary reports that Paul
   himself accepted it, i.e. in a Sabellian sense, and therefore the
   Council rejected it. Male homoÃ¼sion Samosatenus confessus est, sed
   numquid melius Arii negaverunt.' de Syn. 86.

   [3636] Cf. Soz. iii. 18. The heretical party, starting with the notion
   in which their heresy in all its shades consisted, that the Son was a
   distinct being from the Father, concluded that like in essence' was the
   only term which would express the relation of the Son to the Father.
   Here then the word coessential' did just enable the Catholics to join
   issue with them, as exactly expressing what the Catholics wished to
   express, viz. that there was no such distinction between Them as made
   the term like' necessary, but that as material parent and offspring are
   individuals under one common species, so the Eternal Father and Son are
   Persons under one common individual essence.

   [3642] [In this passage the difficulties and confusion which surround
   the terms agenetos and agennetos (supr. p. 149, &c.) come to a head.
   The question is (assuming, as proved by Lightfoot, the validity of the
   distinction of the two in Athan.) which word is to be read here. The
   mss. are divided throughout between the two readings, but it is clear
   (so Lightf. and Zahn on Ign. Eph. 7) that one word alone is in view
   throughout the present passage. That word, then, is pronounced by
   Lightf., partly on the strength of the quotation from the unnamed
   teachers (infr. note 7), partly on the ground of a reference to Â§26
   (see note 10 there), to be agennetos. With all deference to so great an
   authority, I cannot hesitate to pronounce for agenetos. (1.) The
   parallelism of the two senses with the third and fourth senses of agen.
   Orat. i. 30. is almost decisive by itself. (2.) Ath.'s explanation of
   Ignatius. viz. that Christ is genetos on account of the flesh (he would
   have referred gennetos to His Essence, Orat. i. 56, certainly not to
   the flesh), while as Son and Word He is distinct from geneta and
   poiemata, is even more decisive. (3.) His explanation Â§46, sub fin.
   that the Son is agenetos because He is aidion gennema would lose all
   sense if agennetos were read. As a matter of fact, agennetos is the
   specific, agenetos the generic term: the former was not applicable to
   the Eternal Son; the latter was, except in the first of the two senses
   distinguished in the text; a sense, however, more properly coming under
   the specific idea of agennetos. This was the ambiguity which made the
   similarity of the two words so dangerous a weapon in Arian hands. The
   above note does not of course affect the true reading of Ign. Eph. 7,
   as to which Lightfoot and Zahn speak with authority: but it seems clear
   that Athan., however mistakenly, quotes Ign. with the reading
   agenetos.]

   [3653] Arianism was in the dilemma of denying Christ's divinity, or
   introducing a second God. The Arians proper went off on the former side
   of the alternative, the Semi-Arians on the latter; and Athan., as here
   addressing the Semi Arians, insists on the greatness of the latter
   error. This of course was the objection which attached to the words
   homoiousion, aparallaktos eikon, &c., when disjoined from the
   homoousion; and Eusebius's language, supr. p. 75, note 7, shews us that
   it is not an imaginary one.

   [3658] The argument, when drawn out, is virtually this: if, because two
   subjects are coessential, a third is pre-supposed of which they
   partake, then, since either of these two is coessential with that of
   which both partake, a new third must be supposed in which it and the
   pre-existing substance partake and thus an infinite series of things
   coessential must be supposed. Vid. Basil. Ep. 52. n. 2. [Cf. Aristot.

   almost synonymous with ousia or phusis. Indeed in one sense nature,

   Introduction to Tomus Ad Antiochenos.

   ------------------------

   The word tome' (tomos) means either a section, or, in the case of such
   a document as that before us, a concise statement. It is commonly
   applied to synodical letters (cf. the Tome' of Leo, a.d. 450, to
   Flavian).

   Upon the accession of Julian (November, 361) the Homoean ascendancy
   which had marked the last six years of Constantius collapsed. A few
   weeks after his accession (Feb. 362) an edict recalled all the exiled
   Bishops. On Feb. 21 Athanasius re-appeared in Alexandria. He was joined
   there by Lucifer of Cagliari and Eusebius of VercellÃ¦, who were in
   exile in Upper Egypt. Once more free, he took up the work of peace
   which had busied him in the last years of his exile (see Prolegg. ch.
   ii. Â§9). With a heathen once more on the throne of the CÃ¦sars, there
   was everything to sober Christian party spirit, and to promise success
   to the council which met under Athanasius during the ensuing summer.
   Among the twenty-one bishops who formed the assembly the most notable
   are Eusebius of VercellÃ¦, Asterius of Petra, and Dracontius of Lesser
   Hermopolis and Adelphius of Onuphis, the friends and correspondents of
   Athanasius. The rest, with the exception of Anatolius of Euboea, were
   all from Egypt and Marmarica, and (probably three only) from S.W. Asia.
   The council (Newman, Arians, v. i.; Gwatkin, Stud. p. 205, KrÃ¼ger,
   Lucif. 45-53, was occupied with four problems: (1) The terms on which
   communion should be vouchsafed to those Arians who desired to re-unite
   (Â§Â§3, 8). They were to be asked for nothing beyond the Nicene test, and
   an express anathema against Arianism, including the doctrine that the
   Holy Spirit is a Creature. The latter point had been rising into
   prominence of late, and had called forth from Athanasius his four
   Discourses to Serapion of Thmuis. The emphatic way in which the point
   is pressed in Â§3, implies that an attempt was being made in some
   quarter to subscribe the Nicene Creed, while maintaining the Arian
   position with regard to the Holy Spirit. The language of Â§3 cannot be
   reconciled with the hypothesis (Gwatkin, Studies, 233), that no formal
   requirement was made by this council on the subject. The person aimed
   at was possibly Acacius, who (Serap. iv. 7) had treated the subject
   with levity, and yet was now disposed to come to terms (as he did a
   year later, Socr. iii. 25). It is true that we find the names of
   Macedonius and his followers (N.B. not Eleusius) in the number of the
   59 who betook themselves to Liberius (Socr. iv. 12), and neither in
   their letter nor in his reply is there any allusion to the doctrine of
   the Holy Spirit; and that Basil (Ep. 204), with the sanction of
   Athanasius (cf. below, Letters 62, 63), did not press the test upon
   those who were otherwise orthodox. But the council of 362 has Syrian
   circumstances specially in view; and however we may explain it, its
   language is too clear to be mistaken. (On the general subject, cf.
   Letter 55.) (2) The Arian Christology also occupied the council (Â§7).
   The integrity of Christ's human nature on the one hand, its perfect
   Union with the Word on the other, are clearly emphasised. This question
   had begun to come into prominent discussion in several parts of the
   Christian world (e.g. at Corinth, see infr. Letter 59), and was soon to
   give rise to the system of Apollinarius, who, however, it is
   interesting to note, was a party, by his legates, to the present
   decision. (3) The state of the Church at Antioch was the most practical
   problem before the council. Meletius was returning to the presidency of
   the main body of the Antiochene church, whose chief place of worship
   was the Palaea' (Â§3). Since the deposition of Eustathius (c. 330), the
   intransigent or protestant' body had been without a bishop, and were
   headed by the respected presbyter Paulinus. Small in numbers, and
   dependent for a church upon the good will of the Arians, they were yet
   strong in the unsullied orthodoxy of their antecedents, in the sympathy
   of the West and of Athanasius himself, who had given offence at Antioch
   in 346 by worshipping with them alone. Clearly the right course was
   that they should reunite with the main body under Meletius, and this
   was what the council recommended (Â§3), although, perhaps in deference
   to the more uncompromising spirits, the union is treated (ib. and 4) as
   a return of the larger body to the smaller, instead of vice versa. (For
   the sequel, see Prolegg. ubi supra.) (4) With the rivalry of parties at
   Antioch, a weighty question of theological terminology was indirectly
   involved. The word hupostasis had been used in the Nicene anathema as a
   synonym of ousia (see Excursus A, pp. 77 sqq. above), and in this sense
   it was commonly used by Athanasius in agreement with the New Testament
   use of the word (Westcott on Heb. i. 3), with Dionysius of Rome, and
   with the West, to whom hupostasis was etymologically identified with
   Substantia' their (perhaps imperfect) equivalent for ousia. On the
   other hand, the general tendency of Eastern Theology had been to use
   hupostasis in the sense of Subject or Person, for which purpose it
   expressed the idea of individual essence less ambiguously than
   prosopon. This was the use of the word adopted by Origen, Dionysius
   Alex. (supr. de Sent. Dionys.), Alexander of Alexandria (in his letter
   Thdt. H. E. i. 4. p. 16, l. 19), and by Athanasius himself in an
   earlier work (p. 90, supr.) At Antioch the Eustathians appear to have
   followed the Nicene and Western usage, using the word to emphasise the
   Individual Unity of God as against Arian or Subordinationist views,
   while the Meletians protested against the Marcellian monarchianism by
   insisting on three Hypostases in the Godhead. The contradiction was
   mainly verbal, the two parties being substantially at one as to the
   doctrine, but varying in its expression. Hence the wise and charitable
   decision of the council, which came naturally from one who, like
   Athanasius, could use either expression, though he had come to prefer
   the Western to the Eastern use [3673] .

   The Tome was carried to Antioch by the five bishops named at the
   beginning of Â§1, and there subscribed by Paulinus and Karterius of
   Antaradus. As to its effect among the friends of Meletius our
   information is only inferential (see Gwatkin, Studies, p. 208). On the
   supposed disciplinary legislation of this council in relation to the
   Syntagma DoctrinÃ¦, see Prolegg. ch. ii. Â§Â§9.

   N.B. The translation of the present tract as well as that of the ad
   Afros and of Letters 56, 59, 60, 61, was made independently of that by
   Dr. Bright in his Later Treatises of S. Athanasius (see Prolegg. ch. i.
   Â§2), but has been carefully collated with it, and in not a few cases
   improved by its aid. For a fuller commentary on these pieces than has
   been possible in this volume, the reader is referred to Dr. Bright's
   work.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [3673] It may be well to trace briefly the sense of these technical
   terms, the history and significance of which is a forcible reminder of
   the inability of Theology to bring the Infinite within the categories
   of the Finite, to do more than guard our Faith by pointing out the
   paths which experience has shewn to lead to some false limitation of
   the fulness of the Revelation of God in Christ. The distinction (drawn
   out Prolegg. ch. ii. Â§3 (2) b) between the primary and secondary sense
   of ousia in Greek metaphysics does not easily fit the doctrine of the
   Holy Trinity. The ousia common to Father and Son is not the name of a
   Species, as Man' applies to Peter and Paul. But neither can the idea of
   prote ousia be reconciled with inherence in three distinct personal
   existences. (Cf. supr. p. 409, note 7.) But here the word hupostasis
   comes in to help our imagination. The word (see Socr. H. E. iii. 7.
   Westcott, ubi supr. and Newman, Arians, App. 4), from various literal
   senses came to be transferred to the philosophical vocabulary, doing
   duty as verbal substantive not only for huphestanai but for
   hupokeisthai. Like the concrete hupokeimenon it was applied (a) to
   matter as underlying form, (b) to substance as underlying attributes.
   In this latter use it served to distinguish prote from deutera ousia,
   expressing moreover a complete self-contained existence in a way that
   ousia did not. When therefore the idea of personal individuality has to
   be expressed, hupostasis is more suitable than ousia. But the ambiguity
   of the latter word remains. Those who preferred to speak of mia
   hupostasis thought of the Divine Essence rather as prote ousia, and of
   One Personal God, with whom Father, Son, and Spirit were each
   absolutely and fully identified (perichoresis), while with those who
   preferred preis hupostaseis the idea of the Divine ousia approximated
   to deutera ousia, and guarded against Tritheism solely by holding fast
   to the Monarchia of the Father. The corrective to each position lay in
   the recognition of the other, i.e. of its own incompleteness. (See
   further Prolegg. ubi supr. and Zahn, Marcell. p. 87, sq.)

   Tome or Synodal Letter to the People of Antioch.

   ------------------------

   To our beloved and much-desired fellow-ministers Eusebius [3674] ,
   Lucifer [3675] , Asterius [3676] , Kymatius, and Anatolius, Athanasius
   and the bishops present in Alexandria from Italy and Arabia, Egypt and
   Libya; Eusebius, Asterius, Gaius, Agathus, Ammonius, AgathodÃ¦mon,
   Dracontius, Adelphius, HermÃ¦on, Marcus, Theodorus, Andreas, Paphnutius,
   another Marcus, Zoilus, Menas, George, Lucius, Macarius and the rest,
   all greeting in Christ.

   We are persuaded that being ministers of God and good stewards ye are
   sufficient to order the affairs of the Church in every respect. But
   since it has come to us, that many who were formerly separated from us
   by jealousy now wish for peace, while many also having severed their
   connection with the Arian madmen are desiring our communion, we think
   it well to write to your courtesy what ourselves and the beloved
   Eusebius and Asterius have drawn up: yourselves being our beloved and
   truly most-desired fellow-ministers. We rejoice at the said tidings,
   and pray that even if any be left still far from us, and if any appear
   to be in agreement with the Arians, he may promptly leave their
   madness, so that for the future all men everywhere may say, One Lord,
   one faith [3677] .' For as the psalmist says, what is so good or
   pleasant as for brethren to dwell in unity [3678] . But our dwelling is
   the Church, and our mind ought to be the same. For thus we believe that
   the Lord also will dwell with us, who says, I will dwell with them and
   walk in them [3679] ' and Here will I dwell for I have a delight
   therein [3680] .' But by here' what is meant but there where one faith
   and religion is preached?

   2. Mission of Eusebius and Asterius.

   We then of Egypt truly wished to go to you along with our beloved
   Eusebius and Asterius, for many reasons, but chiefly that we might
   embrace your affection and together enjoy the said peace and concord.
   But since, as we declared in our other letters, and as ye may learn
   from our fellow-ministers, the needs of the church detain us, with much
   regret we begged the same fellow-ministers of ours, Eusebius and
   Asterius, to go to you in our stead. And we thank their piety in that
   although they might have gone at once to their dioceses, they preferred
   to go to you at all costs, on account of the pressing need of the
   Church. They therefore having consented, we consoled ourselves with the
   consideration that you and they being there, we all were present with
   you in mind.

   3. The Meletians' to be acknowledged, and all who renounce heresy,
   especially as to the Holy Spirit.

   As many then as desire peace with us, and specially those who assemble
   in the Old [Church] [3681] and those again who are seceding from the
   Arians, do ye call to yourselves, and receive them as parents their
   sons, and welcome them as tutors and guardians; and unite them to our
   beloved Paulinus and his people, without requiring more from them than
   to anathematise the Arian heresy and confess the faith confessed by the
   holy fathers at NicÃ¦a, and to anathematise also those who say that the
   Holy Spirit is a Creature and separate from the Essence of Christ. For
   this is in truth a complete renunciation of the abominable heresy of
   the Arians, to refuse to divide the Holy Trinity, or to say that any
   part of it is a creature. For those who, while pretending to cite the
   faith confessed at NicÃ¦a, venture to blaspheme the Holy Spirit, do
   nothing more than in words deny the Arian heresy while they retain it
   in thought. But let the impiety of Sabellius and of Paul of Samosata
   also be anathematised by all, and the madness of Valentinian and
   Basilides, and the folly of the ManichÃ¦ans. For if this be done, all
   evil suspicion will be removed on all hands, and the faith of the
   Catholic Church alone be exhibited in purity.

   4. The parties at Antioch to unite.

   But that we, and they who have ever remained in communion with us, hold
   this faith, we think no one of yourselves nor any one else is ignorant.
   But since we rejoice with all those who desire re-union, but especially
   with those that assemble in the Old [church], and as we glorify the
   Lord exceedingly, as for all things so especially for the good purpose
   of these men, we exhort you that concord be established with them on
   these terms, and, as we said above, without further conditions, without
   namely any further demand upon yourselves on the part of those who
   assemble in the Old [church], or Paulinus and his fellows propounding
   anything else, or aught beyond the Nicene definition.

   5. The creed of Sardica not an authorised formula. Question of
   hypostasis.'

   And prohibit even the reading or publication of the paper, much talked
   of by some, as having been drawn up concerning the Faith at the synod
   of Sardica. For the synod made no definition of the kind. For whereas
   some demanded, on the ground that the Nicene synod was defective, the
   drafting of a creed, and in their haste even attempted it [3682] , the
   holy synod assembled in Sardica was indignant, and decreed that no
   statement of faith should be drafted, but that they should be content
   with the Faith confessed by the fathers at NicÃ¦a, inasmuch as it lacked
   nothing but was full of piety, and that it was undesirable for a second
   creed to be promulged, lest that drafted at NicÃ¦a should be deemed
   imperfect, and a pretext be given to those who were often wishing to
   draft and define a creed. So that if a man propound the above or any
   other paper, stop them, and persuade them rather to keep the peace. For
   in such men we perceive no motive save only contentiousness. For as to
   those whom some were blaming for speaking of three Subsistences [3683]
   , on the ground that the phrase is unscriptural and therefore
   suspicious, we thought it right indeed to require nothing beyond the
   confession of NicÃ¦a, but on account of the contention we made enquiry
   of them, whether they meant, like the Arian madmen, subsistences
   foreign and strange, and alien in essence from one another, and that
   each Subsistence was divided apart by itself, as is the case with
   creatures in general and in particular with those begotten of men, or
   like different substances, such as gold, silver, or brass;--or whether,
   like other heretics, they meant three Beginnings and three Gods, by
   speaking of three Subsistences.

   They assured us in reply that they neither meant this nor had ever held
   it. But upon our asking them what then do you mean by it, or why do you
   use such expressions?' they replied, Because they believed in a Holy
   Trinity, not a trinity in name only, but existing and subsisting in
   truth, both a Father truly existing and subsisting, and a Son truly
   substantial and subsisting, and a Holy Spirit subsisting and really
   existing do we acknowledge,' and that neither had they said there were
   three Gods or three beginnings, nor would they at all tolerate such as
   said or held so, but that they acknowledged a Holy Trinity but One
   Godhead, and one Beginning, and that the Son is coessential with the
   Father, as the fathers said; while the Holy Spirit is not a creature,
   nor external, but proper to and inseparable from the Essence of the
   Father and the Son.

   6. The question of one Subsistence (Hypostasis) or three, not to be
   pressed.

   Having accepted then these men's interpretation and defence of their
   language, we made enquiry of those blamed by them for speaking of One
   Subsistence, whether they use the expression in the sense of Sabellius,
   to the negation of the Son and the Holy Spirit, or as though the Son
   were non-substantial, or the Holy Spirit impersonal [3684] . But they
   in their turn assured us that they neither meant this nor had ever held
   it, but we use the word Subsistence thinking it the same thing to say
   Subsistence or Essence;' But we hold that there is One, because the Son
   is of the Essence of the Father, and because of the identity of nature.
   For we believe that there is one Godhead, and that it has one nature,
   and not that there is one nature of the Father, from which that of the
   Son and of the Holy Spirit are distinct.' Well, thereupon they who had
   been blamed for saying there were three Subsistences agreed with the
   others, while those who had spoken of One Essence, also confessed the
   doctrine of the former as interpreted by them. And by both sides Arius
   was anathematised as an adversary of Christ, and Sabellius, and Paul of
   Samosata, as impious men, and Valentinus and Basilides as aliens from
   the truth, and ManichÃ¦us as an inventor of mischief. And all, by God's
   grace, and after the above explanations, agree together that the faith
   confessed by the fathers at NicÃ¦a is better than the said phrases, and
   that for the future they would prefer to be content to use its
   language.

   7. The human Nature of Christ complete, not Body only.

   But since also certain seemed to be contending together concerning the
   fleshly Economy of the Saviour, we enquired of both parties. And what
   the one confessed, the others also agreed to, that the Word did not, as
   it came to the prophets, so dwell in a holy man at the consummation of
   the ages, but that the Word Himself was made flesh, and being in the
   Form of God, took the form of a servant [3685] , and from Mary after
   the flesh became man for us, and that thus in Him the human race is
   perfectly and wholly delivered from sin and quickened from the dead,
   and given access to the kingdom of the heavens. For they confessed also
   that the Saviour had not a body without a soul, nor without sense or
   intelligence; for it was not possible, when the Lord had become man for
   us, that His body should be without intelligence: nor was the salvation
   effected in the Word Himself a salvation of body only, but of soul
   also. And being Son of God in truth, He became also Son of Man, and
   being God's Only-begotten Son, He became also at the same time
   firstborn among many brethren [3686] .' Wherefore neither was there one
   Son of God before Abraham, another after Abraham [3687] : nor was there
   one that raised up Lazarus, another that asked concerning him; but the
   same it was that said as man, Where does Lazarus lie [3688] ;' and as
   God raised him up: the same that as man and in the body spat, but
   divinely as Son of God opened the eyes of the man blind from his birth
   [3689] ; and while, as Peter says [3690] , in the flesh He suffered, as
   God opened the tomb and raised the dead. For which reasons, thus
   understanding all that is said in the Gospel, they assured us that they
   held the same truth about the Word's Incarnation and becoming Man.

   8. Questions of words must not be suffered to divide those who think
   alike.

   These things then being thus confessed, we exhort you not hastily to
   condemn those who so confess, and so explain the phrases they use, nor
   to reject them, but rather to accept them as they desire peace and
   defend themselves, while you check and rebuke, as of suspicious views,
   those who refuse so to confess and to explain their language. But while
   you refuse toleration to the latter, counsel the others also who
   explain and hold aright, not to enquire further into each other's
   opinions, nor to fight about words to no useful purpose, nor to go on
   contending with the above phrases, but to agree in the mind of piety.
   For they who are not thus minded, but only stir up strife with such
   petty phrases, and seek something beyond what was drawn up at NicÃ¦a, do
   nothing except give their neighbour turbid confusion to drink [3691] ,'
   like men who grudge peace and love dissensions. But do ye, as good men
   and faithful servants and stewards of the Lord, stop and check what
   gives offence and is strange, and value above all things peace of that
   kind, faith being sound. Perhaps God will have pity on us, and unite
   what is divided, and, there being once more one flock [3692] , we shall
   all have one leader, even our Lord Jesus Christ.

   9. The above terms unanimously agreed upon.

   These things, albeit there was no need to require anything beyond the
   synod of NicÃ¦a, nor to tolerate the language of contention, yet for the
   sake of peace, and to prevent the rejection of men who wish to believe
   aright, we enquired into. And what they confessed, we put briefly into
   writing, we namely who are left in Alexandria, in common with our
   fellow-ministers, Asterius and Eusebius. For most of us had gone away
   to our dioceses. But do you on your part read this in public where you
   are wont to assemble, and be pleased to invite all to you thither. For
   it is right that the letter should be there first read, and that there
   those who desire and strive for peace should be re-united. And then,
   when they are re-united, in the spot where all the laity think best, in
   the presence of your courtesy, the public assemblies should be held,
   and the Lord be glorified by all together. The brethren who are with me
   greet you. I pray that you may be well, and remember us to the Lord;
   both I, Athanasius, and likewise the other bishops assembled, sign, and
   those sent by Lucifer, bishop of the island of Sardinia, two deacons,
   Herennius and Agapetus; and from Paulinus, Maximus and Calemerus,
   deacons also. And there were present certain monks of Apolinarius
   [3693] the bishop, sent from him for the purpose.

   10. Signatures.

   The names of the several bishops to whom the letter is addressed are:
   Eusebius of the city of Virgilli in Gaul [3694] , Lucifer of the island
   of Sardinia, Asterius of Petra, Arabia, Kymatius of Paltus,
   Coele-Syria, Anatolius of Euboea.

   Senders: the Pope Athanasius, and those present with him in Alexandria,
   viz.: Eusebius, Asterius, and the others above-mentioned, Gaius of
   Paratonium [3695] in Hither Libya, Agathus of Phragonis and part of
   Elearchia in Egypt, Ammonius of Pachnemunis [3696] and the rest of
   Elearchia, AgathodÃ¦mon of Schedia [3697] and Menelaitas, Dracontius of
   Lesser Hermupolis, Adelphius of Onuphis [3698] in Lychni, Hermion of
   Tanes [3699] , Marcus of Zygra [3700] , Hither Libya, Theodorus of
   Athribis [3701] , Andreas of Arsenoe, Paphnutius of Sais, Marcus of
   PhilÃ¦, Zoilus of AndrÃ´s [3702] , Menas of Antiphra [3703] .

   Eusebius also signs the following in Latin, of which the translation
   is:

   I Eusebius, according to your exact confession made on either side by
   agreement concerning the Subsistences, also add my agreement; further
   concerning the Incarnation of our Saviour, namely that the Son of God
   has become Man, taking everything upon Himself without sin, like the
   composition of our old man, I ratify the text of the letter. And
   whereas the Sardican paper is ruled out, to avoid the appearance of
   issuing anything beyond the creed of NicÃ¦a, I also add my consent, in
   order that the creed of NicÃ¦a may not seem by it to be excluded, and [I
   agree] that it should not be published. I pray for your health in the
   Lord.

   I Asterius agree to what is above written, and pray for your health in
   the Lord.

   11. The Tome' signed at Antioch.

   And after this Tome was sent off from Alexandria, thus signed by the
   aforesaid, [the recipients] in their turn signed it:

   I Paulinus hold thus, as I received from the fathers, that the Father
   perfectly exists and subsists, and that the Son perfectly subsists, and
   that the Holy Spirit perfectly subsists. Wherefore also I accept the
   above explanation concerning the Three Subsistences, and the one
   Subsistence, or rather Essence, and those who hold thus. For it is
   pious to hold and confess the Holy Trinity in one Godhead. And
   concerning the Word of the Father becoming Man for us, I hold as it is
   written, that, as John says, the Word was made Flesh, not in the sense
   of those most impious persons who say that He has undergone a change,
   but that He has become Man for us, being born of the holy Virgin Mary
   and of the Holy Spirit. For the Saviour had a body neither without
   soul, nor without sense, nor without intelligence. For it were
   impossible, the Lord being made Man for us, that His body should be
   without intelligence. Wherefore I anathematise those who set aside the
   Faith confessed at NicÃ¦a, and who do not say that the Son is of the
   Father's Essence, and coessential with the Father. Moreover I
   anathematise those who say that the Holy Spirit is a Creature made
   through the Son. Once more I anathematise the heresy of Sabellius and
   of Photinus [3704] , and every heresy, walking in the Faith of NicÃ¦a,
   and in all that is above written. I Karterius [3705] pray for your
   health.

   Appendix.

   Exile of Athanasius under Julian, 362-363.

   ------------------------

   The fragment which follows, containing an interesting report of a story
   told by Athanasius to Ammonius, Bishop of Pachnemunis, is inserted here
   as furnishing undesignedly important details as to the movements of
   Athanasius in 363. See Prolegg. ch. v. Â§3 h, also ch. ii. Â§9. It is
   excerpted by Montfaucon from an account of the Abbat Theodore, written
   for Theophilus, Bishop of Alexandria (385-412) by a certain Ammon (Acta
   SS. Maii, Tom. iii. Append., pp. 63-71). The writer was at that time a
   bishop (see unknown): he was born about 335, as he was seventeen years
   old when he embraced the monastic life a year and more' after the
   proclamation of Gallus as CÃ¦sar (Mar. 15, 351). About the time of the
   expulsion of Athanasius by Syrianus he retired to Nitria, where he
   remained many years, and finally returned to Alexandria, where he
   appears (infra) as one of the clergy; the date of his elevation to the
   Episcopate cannot be fixed, but it obviously cannot be as early as
   356-7 (so D.C.B. i. 102 (2), and probably is much later even than 362,
   in which year he would still be hardly twenty-eight. (He mentions the
   objections to the election of Athanasius, who was probably 30 in 328,
   on the ground of his youth.) Accordingly (apart from the different form
   of his name) he cannot [3706] be identified with either of the Ammonii
   referred to in Tom. ad. Ant. 1, note 3; Hist. Ar. 72, &c. The elder of
   the two does not concern us here: the younger (supr. pp. 483, 486), is
   the Ammonius to whom Athanasius told the story in the hearing of Ammon,
   and was now dead. Of Hermon, Bishop of Bubastis, mentioned as present
   along with Ammonius, Theophilus, and Ammon when the story was told,
   nothing is known (except that the date D.C.B. iii. 4 (2) is over 25
   years too early). As he is not of blessed memory,' he was possibly
   still living during the Episcopate of Theophilus and Ammon. (There is
   nothing to identify him with the bishop of Tanes in Tom. Ant. 1, 10.)

   The story itself is given at second-hand, from Ammon's recollection of
   a statement by Athanasius some 12 to 15 years (at least) before he
   wrote. The prophetic details about Jovian may therefore be put down to
   natural accretion (Letter 56, note 2). But (apart from the fact that
   Julian's death must have been rumoured long before the tardy official
   announcement of it, Tillem. Emp. iv. 449 sqq., Prolegg. ubi supr.) that
   Athanasius told of the pheme of Julian's death among the monks of the
   Thebaid need not be doubted. The story is one of a very large class,
   many of which are fairly authenticated. To say nothing of the pheme at
   the battle of Mycale; we have in recent times the authority of Mr. R.
   Stuart Poole, of the British Museum, for the fact that on the night of
   the death of the Duke of Cambridge (July 9, 1850), Mr. Pooles's brother
   suddenly took out his watch and said, "Note the time, the Duke of
   Cambridge is dead," and that the time proved to be correct;' also the
   case of Mr. Edmonds who saw at Leicester, early in the morning of Nov.
   4, 1837, an irruption of water into the works of the Thames tunnel, by
   which a workman was drowned; (other curious cases in Phantasms of the
   Living' vol. 2, pp. 367 sqq.). The letter or memoir from which this
   Narratio' is taken, was published by the Bollandists from a Medicean
   ms., and it bears every internal mark of genuineness. In what way it is
   integrally connected with the Vita Antonii (Gwatkin, Studies, p. 101),
   except by the fact that it happens to mention Antony, I fail to see. On
   the subject of Theodore of Tabenne, the main subject of the memoir, see
   AmÃ©lineau's S. PakhÃ´me ( ut supra, p. 188), also infr. Letter 58, note
   3.

   "As I think your holiness was present and heard, when his blessedness
   Pope Athanasius, in the presence of other clergy of Alexandria and of
   my insignificance, formerly related in the Great Church something about
   Theodorus [3707] , to the Ammonius of blessed memory, bishop of
   Elearchia [3708] , and to Hermon, bishop of the city of Bumastica
   [3709] ; I write only what is necessary to put your reverence in mind
   of what he said. When the famous bishops were wondering at the Blessed
   Antony, Pope Athanasius--for Antony was often with him--said to them:--

   I saw also at that season great men of God, who are lately dead,
   Theodorus chief of the Tabennesian monks, and the father of the monks
   around [3710] Antinoopolis, called Abbas Pammon. For when I was pursued
   by Julian, and was expecting to be slain by him--for this news was
   shewn me by good friends--these two came to me on the same day at
   Antinoopolis. And having planned to hide with Theodorus, I embarked on
   his vessel, which was completely covered in, while Abbas Pammon
   accompanied us. And when the wind was unfavourable, I was very anxious
   and prayed; and the monks with Theodore got out and towed the boat. And
   as Abbas Pammon was encouraging me in my anxiety, I said Believe me
   when I say that my heart is never so trustful in time of peace as in
   time of persecution. For I have good confidence that suffering for
   Christ, and strengthened by His mercy, even though I am slain, I shall
   find mercy with Him.' And while I was still saying this, Theodorus
   fixed his eyes on Abbas Pammon and smiled, while the other nearly
   laughed. So I said to them, Why have you laughed at my words, do you
   convict me of cowardice?' and Theodorus said to Abbas Pammon, Tell him
   why we smiled.' At which the latter said, You ought to tell him.' So
   Theodorus said, in this very hour Julian has been slain in Persia' for
   so God had declared beforehand concerning him: the haughty man, the
   despiser and the boaster, shall finish nothing [3711] . But a Christian
   Emperor shall arise who shall be illustrious, but shall live only a
   short time [3712] . Wherefore you ought not to harass yourselves by
   departing into the Thebaid, but secretly to go to the Court, for you
   will meet him by the way, and having been kindly received by him, will
   return to your Church. And he soon shall be taken by God.' And so it
   happened. From which cause I believe, that many who are well pleasing
   to God live unnoticed, especially among the monks. For those men
   unnoticed also, such as the blessed Amun and the holy Theodorus [3713]
   in the mountain of Nitria, and the servant of God, the happy old man
   Pammon."

   Introduction to Ad Afros Epistola Synodica.

   ------------------------

   (Written About 369.)

   The synodical letter which follows was written after the accession of
   Damasus to the Roman see (366). Whether it was written before any
   Western synod had formally condemned Auxentius of Milan (see Letter 59.
   1) may be doubted: the complaint (Â§10) is rather that he still retains
   possession of his see, which in fact he did until 374, the year after
   the death of Athanasius. At any rate, Damasus had had time to hold a
   large synod, the letter of which had reached Athanasius. The history of
   the synods held by Damasus seems hopelessly obscure, and the date of
   our encyclical is correspondingly doubtful. Damasus certainly held at
   one time a synod of some 90 bishops from Italy and the Gauls, the
   letter of which was sent to Illyricum and to the East (Thdt. H. E. ii.
   22; Soz. vi. 23; Hard. Conc. i. 771: the Latin of the copy sent to
   Illyricum is dated Siricio et Ardabure vv. cl. coss.,' an additional
   element of confusion). The name of Sabinus at the end of the Latin copy
   sent to the East seems to fix the date of this synod (D.C.B. i. 294) to
   372. Thus the synod referred to Â§1 below must have been an earlier one,
   the acts of which are lost. It cannot have been held before the end of
   367 or beginning of 368 (Montf. Vit. Ath.), as the earlier period of
   the episcopate of Damasus was fully occupied by different matters.
   Accordingly our encyclical falls between 368 and 372, probably as soon
   as Damasus had been able to assemble so large a synod, and Athanasius
   to write in reply (Â§10). It may be added that the letter of the
   Damasine synod of 372 refers in ambiguous terms to the condemnation of
   Auxentius as having already taken place, (damnatum esse liquet:' was
   this because they felt unable to dislodge him? see Tillem. viii. 400).

   The occasion of the letter is two-fold: principally to counteract the
   efforts that were being made in the West, and especially in Africa
   (still later in the time of S. Augustine, see Collat. cum Maximin. 4;
   and for earlier Arian troubles in Africa, Nicene Lib. vol. i. p. 287),
   to represent the council of Ariminum as a final settlement of the
   Faith, and so to set aside the authority of the Nicene definition. The
   second object is involved in the first. The head and centre of the
   dying efforts of Arianism in the Roman West was apparently Auxentius,
   one of the last survivors of the victory of Ariminum.' That he should
   be still undisturbed in his see, while working far and wide to the
   damage of the Catholic cause, was to Athanasius a distressing surprise,
   and he was urging the Western bishops to put an end to such an anomaly.

   In the encyclical before us he begins (1-3) by contrasting the synod of
   NicÃ¦a with that of Ariminum, and pointing out the real history of the
   latter, going over again to some extent the ground of the earlier
   sections of the de Synodis. He touches (3. end) on the disastrous
   termination of the Council. He then proceeds to vindicate the Nicene
   creed (4-8) as essentially Scriptural, i.e. as the only possible bar to
   the unscriptural formulÃ¦ of the Arians. This he illustrates (5, 6) by
   an account, substantially identical with that in the de Decretis, of
   the evasions of every other test by the Asian bishops at NicÃ¦a. He
   repeatedly urges that the formula was no invention of the Nicene
   Fathers (6, 9), appealing to the admission of Eusebius to this effect.
   He attacks the Homoean position, shewing that its characteristic
   watchword merely dissembles the alternative between Anomoeanism and the
   true co-essentiality of the Son (7). The most novel argument in the
   Letter is that of Â§4, where he refutes the repudiation of ousia and
   hupostasis in the creed of NikÃ© by an argument from Scripture, starting
   from Ex. iii. 14 (as de Decr. 22 and de Syn. 29), and turning upon the
   equivalence of the two terms in question. This would appeal to
   Westerns, and expresses the usual view of Ath. himself (Tom. ad Ant.
   Introd.) but would not have much force with those who were accustomed
   to the Eastern terminology.

   The insistence (in Â§11) that the Nicene formula involves the Godhead of
   the Spirit should be noted. It seems to imply that, as a rule, such an
   explicit assurance as is insisted upon in Tom ad Ant. 3, would be
   superfluous.

   The completeness of the work of Athanasius, now very near his end, in
   winning over all Egypt to unanimity in faith and in personal attachment
   to himself, is quaintly reflected in the naive assurance (Â§10) that the
   bishops of Egypt and the Libyas are all of one mind, and we always sign
   for one another if any chance not to be present.'

   The translation has been carefully compared with that of Dr. Bright
   (supr. p. 482).

   Letter of Ninety Bishops of Egypt and Libya, including Athanasius.

   ------------------------

   1. Pre-Eminence of the Council of NicÃ¦a. Efforts to exalt that of
   Ariminum at its expense.

   The letters are sufficient which were written by our beloved
   fellow-minister Damasus, bishop of the Great Rome, and the large number
   of bishops who assembled along with him; and equally so are those of
   the other synods which were held, both in Gaul and in Italy, concerning
   the sound Faith which Christ gave us, the Apostles preached, and the
   Fathers, who met at NicÃ¦a from all this world of ours, have handed
   down. For so great a stir was made at that time about the Arian heresy,
   in order that they who had fallen into it might be reclaimed, while its
   inventors might be made manifest. To that council, accordingly, the
   whole world has long ago agreed, and now, many synods having been held,
   all men have been put in mind, both in Dalmatia and Dardania,
   Macedonia, Epirus and Greece, Crete, and the other islands, Sicily,
   Cyprus, Pamphylia, Lycia, and Isauria, all Egypt and the Libyas, and
   most of the Arabians have come to know it, and marvelled at those who
   signed it, inasmuch as even if there were left among them any
   bitterness springing up from the root of the Arians; we mean Auxentius,
   Ursacius, Valens and their fellows, by these letters they have been cut
   off and isolated. The confession arrived at at NicÃ¦a was, we say once
   more, sufficient and enough by itself, for the subversion of all
   irreligious heresy, and for the security and furtherance of the
   doctrine of the Church. But since we have heard that certain wishing to
   oppose it are attempting to cite a synod supposed to have been held at
   Ariminum, and are eagerly striving that it should prevail rather than
   the other, we think it right to write and put you in mind, not to
   endure anything of the sort: for this is nothing else but a second
   growth of the Arian heresy. For what else do they wish for who reject
   the synod held against it, namely the Nicene, if not that the cause of
   Arius should prevail? What then do such men deserve, but to be called
   Arians, and to share the punishment of the Arians? For they were not
   afraid of God, who says, Remove not the eternal boundaries which thy
   fathers placed [3714] ,' and He that speaketh against father or mother,
   let him die the death [3715] :' they were not in awe of their fathers,
   who enjoined that they who hold the opposite of their confession should
   be anathema.

   2. The Synod of NicÃ¦a contrasted with the local Synods held since.

   For this was why an ecumenical synod has been held at NicÃ¦a, 318
   bishops assembling to discuss the faith on account of the Arian heresy,
   namely, in order that local synods should no more be held on the
   subject of the Faith, but that, even if held, they should not hold
   good. For what does that Council lack, that any one should seek to
   innovate? It is full of piety, beloved; and has filled the whole world
   with it. Indians have acknowledged it, and all Christians of other
   barbarous nations. Vain then is the labour of those who have often made
   attempts against it. For already the men we refer to have held ten or
   more synods, changing their ground at each, and while taking away some
   things from earlier decisions, in later ones make changes and
   additions. And so far they have gained nothing by writing, erasing, and
   using force, not knowing that every plant that the Heavenly Father hath
   not planted shall be plucked up [3716] .' But the word of the Lord
   which came through the ecumenical Synod at NicÃ¦a, abides for ever
   [3717] . For if one compare number with number, these who met at NicÃ¦a
   are more than those at local synods, inasmuch as the whole is greater
   than the part. But if a man wishes to discern the reason of the Synod
   at NicÃ¦a, and that of the large number subsequently held by these men,
   he will find that while there was a reasonable cause for the former,
   the others were got together by force, by reason of hatred and
   contention. For the former council was summoned because of the Arian
   heresy, and because of Easter, in that they of Syria, Cilicia and
   Mesopotamia differed from us, and kept the feast at the same season as
   the Jews. But thanks to the Lord, harmony has resulted not only as to
   the Faith, but also as to the Sacred Feast. And that was the reason of
   the synod at NicÃ¦a. But the subsequent ones were without number, all
   however planned in opposition to the ecumenical.

   3. The true nature of the proceedings at Ariminum.

   This being pointed out, who will accept those who cite the synod of
   Ariminum, or any other, against the Nicene? or who could help hating
   men who set at nought their fathers' decisions, and put above them the
   newer ones, drawn up at Ariminum with contention and violence? or who
   would wish to agree with these men, who do not accept even their own?
   For in their own ten or more synods, as I said above, they wrote now
   one thing, now another, and so came out clearly as themselves the
   accusers of each one. Their case is not unlike that of the Jewish
   traitors in old times. For just as they left the one well of the living
   water, and hewed for themselves broken cisterns, which cannot hold
   water, as the prophet Jeremiah has it [3718] , so these men, fighting
   against the one ecumenical synod, hewed for themselves' many synods,
   and all appeared empty, like a sheaf without strength [3719] .' Let us
   not then tolerate those who cite the Ariminian or any other synod
   against that of NicÃ¦a. For even they who cite that of Ariminum appear
   not to know what was done there, for else they would have said nothing
   about it. For ye know, beloved, from those who went from you to
   Ariminum, how Ursacius and Valens, Eudoxius [3720] and Auxentius [3721]
   (and there Demophilus [3722] also was with them), were deposed, after
   wishing to write something to supersede the Nicene decisions. For on
   being requested to anathematise the Arian heresy, they refused, and
   preferred to be its ringleaders. So the bishops, like genuine servants
   of the Lord and orthodox believers (and there were nearly 200 [3723] ),
   wrote that they were satisfied with the Nicene alone, and desired and
   held nothing more or less than that. This they also reported to
   Constantius, who had ordered the assembling of the synod. But the men
   who had been deposed at Ariminum went off to Constantius, and caused
   those who had reported against them to be insulted, and threatened with
   not being allowed to return to their dioceses, and to be treated with
   violence in Thrace that very winter, to compel them to tolerate their
   innovations.

   4. The Nicene formula in accordance with Scripture.

   If then any cite the synod of Ariminum, firstly let them point out the
   deposition of the above persons, and what the bishops wrote, namely
   that none should seek anything beyond what had been agreed upon by the
   fathers at NicÃ¦a, nor cite any synod save that one. But this they
   suppress, but make much of what was done by violence in Thrace [3724] ;
   thus shewing that they are dissemblers of the Arian heresy, and aliens
   from the sound Faith. And again, if a man were to examine and compare
   the great synod itself, and those held by these people, he would
   discover the piety of the one and the folly of the others. They who
   assembled at NicÃ¦a did so not after being deposed: and secondly, they
   confessed that the Son was of the Essence of the Father. But the
   others, after being deposed again and again, and once more at Ariminum
   itself, ventured to write that it ought not to be said that the Son had
   Essence or Subsistence. This enables us to see, brethren, that they of
   NicÃ¦a breathe the spirit of Scripture, in that God says in Exodus
   [3725] , I am that I am,' and through Jeremiah, Who is in His substance
   [3726] and hath seen His word;' and just below, if they had stood in My
   subsistence [3727] and heard My words:' now subsistence is essence, and
   means nothing else but very being, which Jeremiah calls existence, in
   the words, and they heard not the voice of existence [3728] .' For
   subsistence, and essence, is existence: for it is, or in other words
   exists. This Paul also perceiving wrote to the Hebrews, who being the
   brightness of his glory, and the express Image of his subsistence
   [3729] .' But the others, who think they know the Scriptures and call
   themselves wise, and do not choose to speak of subsistence in God (for
   thus they wrote at Ariminum and at other synods of theirs), were surely
   with justice deposed, saying as they did, like the fool did in his
   heart [3730] , God is not.' And again the fathers taught at NicÃ¦a that
   the Son and Word is not a creature, nor made, having read all things
   were made through Him [3731] ,' and in Him were all things created, and
   consist [3732] ;' while these men, Arians rather than Christians, in
   their other synods have ventured to call Him a creature, and one of the
   things that are made, things of which He Himself is the Artificer and
   Maker. For if through Him all things were made' and He too is a
   creature, He would be the creator of Himself. And how can what is being
   created create? or He that is creating be created?

   5. How the test Coessential' came to be adopted at NicÃ¦a.

   But not even thus are they ashamed, although they say such things as
   cause them to be hated by all; citing the Synod of Ariminum, only to
   shew that there also they were deposed. And as to the actual definition
   of NicÃ¦a, that the Son is coessential with the Father, on account of
   which they ostensibly oppose the synod, and buzz around everywhere like
   gnats about the phrase, either they stumble at it from ignorance, like
   those who stumble at the stone of stumbling that was laid in Sion
   [3733] ; or else they know, but for that very reason are constantly
   opposing and murmuring, because it is an accurate declaration and full
   in the face of their heresy. For it is not the phrases that vex them,
   but the condemnation of themselves which the definition contains. And
   of this, once again, they are themselves the cause, even if they wish
   to conceal the fact of which they are perfectly aware,--But we must now
   mention it, in order that hence also the accuracy of the great synod
   may be shewn. For [3734] the assembled bishops wished to put away the
   impious phrases devised by the Arians, namely made of nothing,' and
   that the Son was a thing made,' and a creature,' and that there was a
   time when He was not,' and that He is of mutable nature.' And they
   wished to set down in writing the acknowledged language of Scripture,
   namely that the Word is of God by nature Only-begotten, Power, Wisdom
   of the Father, Very God, as John says, and as Paul wrote, brightness of
   the Father's glory and express image of His person [3735] . But
   Eusebius and his fellows, drawn on by their own error, kept conferring
   together as follows: Let us assent. For we also are of God: for "there
   is one God of whom are all things [3736] ," and "old things are passed
   away, behold all things are made new, but all things are of God [3737]
   ."' And they considered what is written in the Shepherd [3738] , Before
   all things believe that God is one, who created and set all things in
   order, and made them to exist out of nothing.' But the Bishops,
   beholding their craftiness, and the cunning of their impiety, expressed
   more plainly the sense of the words of God,' by writing that the Son is
   of the Essence of God, so that whereas the Creatures, since they do not
   exist of themselves without a cause, but have a beginning of their
   existence, are said to be of God,' the Son alone might be deemed proper
   to the Essence of the Father. For this is peculiar to one who is
   Only-begotten and true Word in relation to a Father, and this was the
   reason why the words of the essence' were adopted. Again [3739] , upon
   the bishops asking the dissembling minority if they agreed that the Son
   was not a Creature, but the Power and only Wisdom of the Father, and
   the Eternal Image, in all respects exact, of the Father, and true God,
   Eusebius and his fellows were observed exchanging nods with one
   another, as much as to say this applies to us men also, for we too are
   called "the image and glory of God [3740] ," and of us it is said, "For
   we which live are alway [3741] ," and there are many Powers, and "all
   the power [3742] of the Lord went out of the land of Egypt," while the
   caterpillar and the locust are called His "great power [3743] ." And
   "the Lord of powers [3744] is with us, the God of Jacob is our help."
   For we hold that we are proper [3745] to God, and not merely so, but
   insomuch that He has even called us brethren. Nor does it vex us, even
   if they call the Son Very God. For when made He exists in verity.'

   6. The Nicene test not unscriptural in sense, nor a novelty.

   Such was the corrupt mind of the Arians. But here too the Bishops,
   beholding their craftiness, collected from the Scriptures the figures
   of brightness, of the river and the well, and of the relation of the
   express Image to the Subsistence, and the texts, in thy light shall we
   see light [3746] ,' and I and the Father are one [3747] .' And lastly
   they wrote more plainly, and concisely, that the Son was coessential
   with the Father; for all the above passages signify this. And their
   murmuring, that the phrases are unscriptural, is exposed as vain by
   themselves, for they have uttered their impieties in unscriptural
   terms: (for such are of nothing' and there was a time when He was
   not'), while yet they find fault because they were condemned by
   unscriptural terms pious in meaning. While they, like men sprung from a
   dunghill, verily spoke of the earth [3748] ,' the Bishops, not having
   invented their phrases for themselves, but having testimony from their
   Fathers, wrote as they did. For ancient bishops, of the Great Rome and
   of our city, some 130 years ago, wrote [3749] and censured those who
   said that the Son was a creature and not coessential with the Father.
   And Eusebius knew this, who was bishop of CÃ¦sarea, and at first an
   accomplice [3750] of the Arian heresy; but afterwards, having signed at
   the Council of NicÃ¦a, wrote to his own people affirming as follows: we
   know that certain eloquent and distinguished bishops and writers even
   of ancient date used the word "coessential" with reference to the
   Godhead of the Father and the Son.'

   7. The position that the Son is a Creature inconsistent and untenable.

   Why then do they go on citing the Synod of Ariminum, at which they were
   deposed? Why do they reject that of NicÃ¦a, at which their Fathers
   signed the confession that the Son is of the Father's Essence and
   coessential with Him? Why do they run about? For now they are at war
   not only with the bishops who met at NicÃ¦a, but with their own great
   bishops and their own friends. Whose heirs or successors then are they?
   How can they call men fathers, whose confession, well and apostolically
   drawn up, they will not accept? For if they think they can object to
   it, let them speak, or rather answer, that they may be convicted of
   falling foul of themselves, whether they believe the Son when He says,
   I and my Father are one,' and he that hath seen Me hath seen the Father
   [3751] .' Yes,' they must answer, since it is written we believe it.'
   But if they are asked how they are one, and how he that hath seen the
   Son hath seen the Father, of course, we suppose they will say, by
   reason of resemblance,' unless they have quite come to agree with those
   who hold the brother-opinion to theirs, and are called [3752]
   Anomoeans. But if once more they are asked, how is He like?' they
   brasen it out and say, by perfect virtue and harmony, by having the
   same will with the Father, by not willing what the Father wills not.'
   But let them understand that one assimilated to God by virtue and will
   is liable also to the purpose of changing; but the Word is not thus,
   unless He is like' in part, and as we are, because He is not like [God]
   in essence also. But these characteristics belong to us, who are
   originate, and of a created nature. For we too, albeit we cannot become
   like God in essence, yet by progress in virtue imitate God, the Lord
   granting us this grace, in the words, Be ye merciful as your Father is
   merciful:' be ye perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect [3753] .'
   But that originate things are changeable, no one can deny, seeing that
   angels transgressed, Adam disobeyed, and all stand in need of the grace
   of the Word. But a mutable thing cannot be like God who is truly
   unchangeable, any more than what is created can be like its creator.
   This is why, with regard to us, the holy man said, Lord, who shall be
   likened unto thee [3754] ,' and who among the gods is like unto thee,
   Lord [3755] ;' meaning by gods those who, while created, had yet become
   partakers of the Word, as He Himself said, If he called them gods to
   whom the word of God came [3756] .' But things which partake cannot be
   identical with or similar to that whereof they partake. For example, He
   said of Himself, I and the Father are one [3757] ,' implying that
   things originate are not so. For we would ask those who allege the
   Ariminian Synod, whether a created essence can say, what things I see
   my Father make, those I make also [3758] .' For things originate are
   made and do not make; or else they made even themselves. Why, if, as
   they say, the Son is a Creature and the Father is His Maker, surely the
   Son would be His own maker, as He is able to make what the Father
   makes, as He said. But such a supposition is absurd and utterly
   untenable, for none can make himself.

   8. The Son's relation to the Father essential, not merely ethical.

   Once more, let them say whether things originate could say [3759] , all
   things whatsoever the Father hath are Mine.' Now, He has the
   prerogative of creating and making, of Eternity, of omnipotence, of
   immutability. But things originate cannot have the power of making, for
   they are creatures; nor eternity, for their existence has a beginning;
   nor of omnipotence and immutability, for they are under sway, and of
   changeable nature, as the Scriptures say. Well then, if these
   prerogatives belong to the Son, they clearly do so, not on account of
   His virtue, as said above, but essentially, even as the synod said, He
   is of no other essence' but of the Father's, to whom these prerogatives
   are proper. But what can that be which is proper to the Father's
   essence, and an offspring from it, or what name can we give it, save
   coessential?' For that which a man sees in the Father, that sees he
   also in the Son; and that not by participation, but essentially. And
   this is [the meaning of] I and the Father are one,' and he that hath
   seen Me hath seen the Father.' Here especially once more it is easy to
   shew their folly. If it is from virtue, the antecedent of willing and
   not willing, and of moral progress, that you hold the Son to be like
   the Father; while these things fall under the category of quality;
   clearly you call God compound of quality and essence. But who will
   tolerate you when you say this? For God, who compounded all things to
   give them being, is not compound, nor of similar nature to the things
   made by Him through the Word. Far be the thought. For He is simple
   essence, in which quality is not, nor, as James says, any variableness
   or shadow of turning [3760] .' Accordingly, if it is shewn that it is
   not from virtue (for in God there is no quality, neither is there in
   the Son), then He must be proper to God's essence. And this you will
   certainly admit if mental apprehension is not utterly destroyed in you.
   But what is that which is proper to and identical with the essence of
   God, and an Offspring from it by nature, if not by this very fact
   coessential with Him that begat it? For this is the distinctive
   relation of a Son to a Father, and he who denies this, does not hold
   that the Word is Son in nature and in truth.

   9. The honest repudiation of Arianism involves the acceptance of the
   Nicene test.

   This then the Fathers perceived when they wrote that the Son was
   coessential with the Father, and anathematised those who say that the
   Son is of a different Subsistence [3761] : not inventing phrases for
   themselves, but learning in their turn, as we said, from the Fathers
   who had been before them. But after the above proof, their Ariminian
   Synod is superfluous, as well as any [3762] other synod cited by them
   as touching the Faith. For that of NicÃ¦a is sufficient, agreeing as it
   does with the ancient bishops also, in which too their fathers signed,
   whom they ought to respect, on pain of being thought anything but
   Christians. But if even after such proofs, and after the testimony of
   the ancient bishops, and the signature of their own Fathers, they
   pretend as if in ignorance to be alarmed at the phrase coessential,'
   then let them say and hold, in simpler terms and truly, that the Son is
   Son by nature, and anathematise as the synod enjoined those who say
   that the Son of God is a Creature or a thing made, or of nothing, or
   that there was once a time when He was not, and that He is mutable and
   liable to change, and of another Subsistence. And so let them escape
   the Arian heresy. And we are confident that in sincerely anathematising
   these views, they ipso facto confess that the Son is of the Father's
   Essence, and coessential with Him. For this is why the Fathers, having
   said that the Son was coessential, straightway added, but those who say
   that He is a creature, or made, or of nothing, or that there was once a
   time when He was not,' the Catholic Church anathematises: namely in
   order that by this means they might make it known that these things are
   meant by the word coessential.' And the meaning Coessential' is known
   from the Son not being a Creature or thing made: and because he that
   says coessential' does not hold that the Word is a Creature: and he
   that anathematises the above views, at the same time holds that the Son
   is coessential with the Father; and he that calls Him coessential,'
   calls the Son of God genuinely and truly so; and he that calls Him
   genuinely Son understands the texts, I and the Father are one,' and he
   that hath seen Me hath seen the Father [3763] .'

   10. Purpose of this Letter; warning against Auxentius of Milan.

   Now it would be proper to write this at greater length. But since we
   write to you who know, we have dictated it concisely, praying that
   among all the bond of peace might be preserved, and that all in the
   Catholic Church should say and hold the same thing. And we are not
   meaning to teach, but to put you in mind. Nor is it only ourselves that
   write, but all the bishops of Egypt and the Libyas, some ninety in
   number. For we all are of one mind in this, and we always sign for one
   another if any chance not to be present. Such being our state of mind,
   since we happened to be assembled, we wrote, both to our beloved
   Damasus, bishop of the Great Rome, giving an account of Auxentius
   [3764] who has intruded upon the church at Milan; namely that he not
   only shares the Arian heresy, but is also accused of many offences,
   which he committed with Gregory [3765] , the sharer of his impiety; and
   while expressing our surprise that so far he has not been deposed and
   expelled from the Church, we thanked [Damasus] for his piety and that
   of those who assembled at the Great Rome, in that by expelling Ursacius
   and Valens, and those who hold with them, they preserved the harmony of
   the Catholic Church. Which we pray may be preserved also among you, and
   therefore entreat you not to tolerate, as we said above, those who put
   forward a host of synods held concerning the Faith, at Ariminum, at
   Sirmium, in Isauria, in Thrace, those in Constantinople, and the many
   irregular ones in Antioch. But let the Faith confessed by the Fathers
   at NicÃ¦a alone hold good among you, at which all the fathers, including
   those of the men who now are fighting against it, were present, as we
   said above, and signed: in order that of us too the Apostle may say,
   Now I praise you that ye remember me in all things, and as I handed the
   traditions to you, so ye hold them fast [3766] .'

   11. Godhead of the Spirit also involved in the Nicene Creed.

   For this Synod of NicÃ¦a is in truth a proscription of every heresy. It
   also upsets those who blaspheme the Holy Spirit, and call Him a
   Creature. For the Fathers, after speaking of the faith in the Son,
   straightway added, And we believe in the Holy Ghost,' in order that by
   confessing perfectly and fully the faith in the Holy Trinity they might
   make known the exact form of the Faith of Christ, and the teaching of
   the Catholic Church. For it is made clear both among you and among all,
   and no Christian can have a doubtful mind on the point, that our faith
   is not in the Creature, but in one God, Father Almighty, maker of all
   things visible and invisible: and in one Lord Jesus Christ His
   Only-begotten Son, and in one Holy Ghost; one God, known in the holy
   and perfect Trinity, baptized into which, and in it united to the
   Deity, we believe that we have also inherited the kingdom of the
   heavens, in Christ Jesus our Lord, through whom to the Father be the
   glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen.

   creed of NikÃ©, 359 a.d.), and was comparatively unfamiliar to

   [3764] Auxentius (not in D.C.B.) was a native of Cappadocia (Hist. Ar.
   75), and had been ordained presbyter at Alexandria by Gregory (next
   note). Upon the expulsion of the somewhat weak-kneed Dionysius after
   the council at Milan (355) he was appointed to that see by Constantius,
   although according to Athanasius (ubi supr.) he knew no Latin, nor any
   thing else except irreligion (a busybody rather than a Christian'). He
   took a leading part along with Valens and others at the Council of
   Ariminum (de Syn. 8, 10) and was included in the deposition of Arian
   leaders by that synod. Under the orthodox Valentinian he maintained his
   see in spite of the efforts of Philaster, Evagrius, and Eusebius of
   VercellÃ¦, and in spite of the condemnations passed upon him by various
   Western synods (362-371, see ad Epict. 1). In 364, Hilary travelled to
   Milan on purpose to expose him before Valentinian. In a discussion
   ordered by the latter, Hilary extorted from Auxentius a confession
   which satisfied the Emperor, but not Hilary himself, whose persistent
   denunciation of its insincerity caused his dismissal from the town.
   Auxentius seems after this to have intrigued to obtain Illyrian
   signatures to the creed of ( NikÃ© or) Ariminum (Hard. Conc. 1. pp. 771,
   773). Upon his death (374) Ambrose was elected bishop of Milan, but was
   confronted by the Arian party with a rival bishop in the person of a
   second Auxentius, said to have been a pupil of Ulfilas.

   [3765] The intrusive bishop of Alexandria, 339-346. He had ordained his
   fellow-countryman Auxentius (Hilar. in Aux. 8).

   Letters of Athanasius,

   with Two Ancient Chronicles of His Life.

   ------------------------

   The Letters cannot be arranged in strict sequence of time without
   breaking into the homogeneity of the corpus of Easter Letters.
   Accordingly we divide them into two parts: (1) all that remain of the
   Easter or Festal Epistles: (2) Personal Letters. From the latter class
   we exclude synodical or encyclical documents, or treatises merely
   inscribed to a friend, such as those printed above pp. 91, 149, 173,
   222, &c., &c., the ad Serapionem, ad Marcellinum, &c. There remain a
   number of highly interesting letters, the survivals of what must have
   been a large correspondence, all of which, excepting six (Nos. 52, 54,
   56, 59, 60, 61), now appear in English for the first time. They are
   arranged as nearly as possible in strict chronological order, though
   this is in some cases open to doubt (e.g. 60, 64, &c.). They mostly
   belong to the later half of the episcopate of Athanasius, and are
   therefore placed after the Festal Collection, which however itself
   extends to the end of the Bishop's life. The immemorial numbering of
   the latter collection is of course retained, although many of the
   forty-five are no longer to be found.

   Prefixed to the Letters are two almost contemporary chronicles, the one
   preserved in the same ms. as Letters 46, 47, the other prefixed to the
   Syriac ms., which is our sole channel for the bulk of the Easter
   Letters. A memorandum appended to Letter 64 specifies certain fragments
   not included in this volume. The striking fragment Filiis suis has been
   conjecturally placed among the remains of Letter 29.

   For the arrangement of the Letters, the reader is referred to the
   general Table of Contents to this volume. We now give

   a. The Historia Acephala or Maffeian fragment, with short introduction.

   b. The Chronicon PrÃ¦vium or Festal Index, with introduction to it and
   to the Festal Letters.

   A.--The Historia Acephala.

   ------------------------

   This most important document was brought to light in 1738 by the
   Marchese F. Scipio Maffei ( 1755), from a Latin ms. (uncial parchment)
   in the Chapter Library at Verona. It was reprinted from Maffei's
   Osservazioni Letterarie in the Padua edition of Athanasius; also in
   1769 by Gallandi (Bibl. Patr. v. 222), from which edition (the reprint
   in Migne, xxvi. 1443 sqq. being full of serious misprints) the
   following version has been made. The Latin text (including letters 46,
   47, and a Letter of the Council of Sardica) is very imperfect, but the
   annalist is so careful in his reckonings, and so often repeats himself,
   that the careful reader can nearly always use the document to make good
   its own gaps or wrong readings. Beyond this (except the insertion of
   the consuls for 372, Â§17 ad fin.) the present editor has not ventured
   [3767] to go. The importance and value of the fragment must now be
   shewn.

   The annalist evidently writes under the episcopate of Theophilus, to
   which he hurriedly brings down his chronology after the death of
   Athanasius (Â§19). At the fortieth anniversary of the episcopate of
   Athanasius, June 8, 368, he makes a pause (Â§17) in order to reckon up
   his dates. This passage is the key of the whole of his chronological
   data. He accounts for the period of forty years (thus placing the
   accession of Ath. at June 8, 328, in agreement with the Index), shewing
   how it is exactly made up by the periods of exile' and of quiet'
   previously mentioned. To quiet' he assigns xxii years v months and x
   days,' to exile' xvii years vi months xx days; total xl years. He then
   shews how the latter is made up by the several exiles he has
   chronicled. As the text stands we have the following sum:

   Table A.

   Exiles

   (1)

                          xc months

                                   iii days

   [(2)]

   (3)

                          lxxii "

                                   xiv "

   (4)

                          xv "

                                   xxii "

   (5)

                          iv "

   exact result'

                xvii years

                          vi months

                                   xx days

   Now the exact result of the figures as they stand is 182 months, 9
   days, i.e. 15 years 2 months and 9 days, or 2 years 4 months and 11
   days too little. Moreover of the well-known five exiles,' only four are
   accounted for. An exile has thus dropped out, and an item of 2 years 4
   months 11 days. Now this corresponds exactly with the interval from
   Epiphi 17 (July 11), 335 (departure for Tyre, Fest. Ind. viii), to
   Athyr 27 (Nov. 23), 337 (return to Alexandria F. I. x). The annalist
   then (followed apparently by Theodt. H. E. ii. 1) reckoned the first
   exile at the above figure. But what of the first figure in our table,
   xc months iii days? It again exactly coincides with the interval from
   Pharm. 21 (Apr. 16, Easter Monday), 339 to Paophi 24 (Oct. 21), 346, on
   which day (Â§1) Athan. returned from his second exile. This double
   coincidence cannot be an accident. It demonstrates beyond all dispute
   that the missing item of ann. ii, mens. iv, d. xii' has dropped out
   after Treveris in Galliis,' and that mens. xc, dies iii' relates to the
   second exile, so that, in Â§1 also, the annalist wrote not annos vi' but
   annos vii menses vi dies iii,' which he repeats Â§17 by its equivalent
   mens. xc, d. iii,' while words have dropped out in Â§1 to the effect of
   what is supplied in brackets. (Hefele, ii. 50, Eng. Tr., is therefore
   in error here).

   I would add that the same obvious principle of correcting a clearly
   corrupt figure by the writer's own subsequent reference to it, enables
   us also to correct the last figures of Â§2 by those of Â§5, to correct
   the items by the sum total of Â§Â§6, 7, and lastly to correct the corrupt
   readings Gregorius' for Georgius, and Constans' for Constantius, by the
   many uncorrupt places which shew that the annalist himself was
   perfectly aware of the right names.

   In one passage alone (Â§13 Athyr' twice for Mechir, cf. Fest. Ind. viii)
   is conjecture really needed; but even here the consuls are correctly
   given, and support the right date.

   We are now in a position to construct tables of exiles' and quiet'
   periods from the Historia as corrected by itself.

   N.B. In the above Table, (a) denotes dates or figures directly implied
   in the existing text, (b) those implied by it in combination with other
   sources, (c) those based on conjectural emendation of the existing
   text. All unmarked data are expressly given.

   Table B shews the deliberate and careful calculation which runs through
   the system of our annalist. Once or twice he indulges in a round
   figure, exiles 1 and 5 are each a day too long by the Egyptian
   calendar, and this is set off by his apparently reckoning the fifth
   quiet period as two days too short. But the writer clearly knew his own
   mind. In fact, the one just ground on which we might distrust his
   chronology is its systematic character. He has a thorough scheme of his
   own, which he carries out to a nicety. Now such a chronology is not
   necessarily untrustworthy. Its consistency may be artificial; on the
   other hand, it may be due to accurate knowledge of the facts. Whether
   this is so or not must be ascertained partly from a writer's known
   opportunities and capacity, partly from his agreement or discrepancy
   with other sources of knowledge. Now our annalist wrote in the time of
   Theophilus (385-412), and may therefore rank as a contemporary of
   Athanasius (cf. Prolegg. ch. v.) His opportunities therefore were
   excellent. As to his capacity, his work bears every trace of care and
   skill. He is no historian, nor a stylist, but as an annalist he
   understood what he was doing. As to agreement with other data, we
   remark to begin with that it was the publication of this fragment in
   the 18th century that first shed a ray of light on the Erebus and Chaos
   of the chronology of the Council of Sardica and its adjacent events;
   that it at once justified the critical genius of Montfaucon, Tillemont
   and others, against the objections with which their date for the death
   of Athanasius [3768] was assailed, and here again upset the confused
   chronological statements of the fifth-century historians in favour of
   the incidental evidence of many more primary authorities [3769] . But
   most important of all is its confirmation by the evidence of the Festal
   Letters discovered in 1842, and especially by their Index, the
   so-called Chronicon Athanasianum.' It is evident at a glance that our
   annalist is quite independent of the Index, as he gives many details
   which it does not contain. But neither can the Index be a compilation
   from the annalist. Each writer had access to information not embodied
   in the other, and there is no positive evidence that either used the
   other in any way. When they agree, therefore, their evidence has the
   greatest possible weight. Their main heads of agreement are indicated
   in the Chronological Table, Prolegg. sub fin.

   It remains to notice shortly the two digressions on the doings of
   Eudoxius and the Anomoeans (Â§Â§2, 12 of Migne, paragraphs II, IX of
   Gallandi). Here the annalist is off his own ground, and evidently less
   well informed. In Â§2 we learn nothing of interest: but the Ecthesis' of
   the Anomoeans in par. IX is of importance, and only too evidently
   authentic. It still awaits a critical examination, and it is not easy
   to give it its exact place in the history of the later Arianism.
   Apparently it belongs to the period 360-364, when the Anomoeans were
   organising their schism (Gwatkin, pp. 226, 180) the names being those
   of the ultra-Arians condemned by the Homoeans in 360 (Prolegg. ch. ii.
   Â§8 fin.).

   The contrast between the vagueness of statement in these digressions,
   and the writer's firmness of touch in dealing with Alexandrian affairs
   is most significant.

   The fragment runs as follows:
     __________________________________________________________________

   [3767] The corrections were made before he could obtain the essay and
   text of Sievers (Zeitsch. Hist. Theol. 1868), where he now finds them
   nearly all anticipated. Sievers' discussion has been carefully and
   gratefully used, but his text is defective, especially from the
   accidental omission of one of the key-clauses of the whole (Â§17).

   [3768] But our annalist gives May 3, while Fest. Ind. gives May 2, the
   day solemnised in the Coptic Martyrologies (Mai, Script. Vett. vol. 4,
   part 2, pp. 29, 114), and doubtless the right one. Perhaps, if
   Athanasius died in the night of May 2-3, the former day might be chosen
   for his commemoration, while our annalist may still be literally exact.

   Historia Acephala.

   I. 1. The Emperor Constantius also wrote concerning the return of
   Athanasius, and among the Emperor's letters this one too is to be
   found.

   2. And it came to pass after the death of Gregory that Athanasius
   returned from the city of Rome and the parts of Italy, and entered
   Alexandria Paophi xxiv, Coss. Constantius IV, Constans III (October 21,
   346); that is after [vii] years vi [months and iii days,] and remained
   quiet at Alexandria ix [3770] years iii [3771] months [and xix days].

   II. Now after his return, Coss. Limenius [3772] and Catulinus (349),
   Theodore [3773] , Narcissus [3774] , and George, with others, came to
   Constantinople, wishing to persuade Paul to communicate with them, who
   received them not even with a word, and answered their greeting with an
   anathema. So they took to themselves Eusebius of Nicomedia [3775] , and
   laid snares for the most blessed Paul, and lodging a calumny against
   him concerning Constans and Magnentius, expelled him from CP. that they
   might have room there, and sow the Arian heresy. Now the people of CP.,
   desiring the most blessed Paul, raised continual riots to prevent his
   being taken from the city, for they loved his sound doctrine. The
   Emperor, however, was angry, and sent Count Hermogenes to cast him out;
   but the people, hearing this, dragged forth Hermogenes through the
   midst of the town. From which matter they obtained a pretext against
   the Bishop, and exiled him to Armenia. Theodore and the rest wishing to
   place in the See of that Town Eudoxius, an ally and partisan of the
   Arian heresy, ordained [Bishop] of Germanicia, while the people were
   stirred to riot, and would not allow any one to sit in the See of
   blessed Paul,--they took Macedonius, a presbyter of Paul, and ordained
   him bishop of the town of CP., whom the whole assembly of bishops
   condemned, since against his own father he had disloyally received
   laying on of hands from heretics.

   However, after Macedonius had communicated with them and signed, they
   brought in pretexts of no importance, and removing him from the Church,
   they instal the aforesaid Eudoxius of Antioch [3776] , whence [the
   partakers] in this secession are called Macedonians, making shipwreck
   concerning the Holy Spirit.

   III. 3. After this time Athanasius, hearing that there was to be
   disturbance against him, the Emperor Constantius [3777] being in
   residence at Milan (353), sent to court a vessel with v Bishops,
   Serapion of Thmuis, Triadelphus of Nicotas, Apollo of Upper Cynopolis,
   Ammonius of Pachemmon,...and iii Presbyters of Alexandria, Peter the
   Physician, Astericus, and Phileas. After their setting sail from
   Alexandria, Coss. Constantius VI Augustus, and Constantius [3778] CÃ¦sar
   II, Pachom xxiv (May 19, 353), presently four days after Montanus of
   the Palace entered Alexandria Pachom xxviii, and gave a letter of the
   same Constantius [3779] Augustus to the bishop Athanasius, forbidding
   him to come to court, on which account the bishop was exceedingly
   desolate, and the whole people much troubled [3780] . So Montanus,
   accomplishing nothing, set forth, leaving the bishop at Alexandria.

   4. Now after a while Diogenes, Imperial Notary, came to Alexandria in
   the month of Mensor (August, 355) Coss. Arbetion and Lollianus: that is
   ii years and v months [3781] from when Montanus left Alexandria. And
   Diogenes pressed every one urgently to compel the bishop to leave the
   town, and afflicted all not a little. Now on the vi day of the month
   Thoth, he made a sharp attempt to besiege the church, and he spent iv
   months in his efforts, that is from the month Mensor, or from the
   [first] day of those intercalated until the xxvi day of Choiac (Dec.
   23). But as the people and the judges strongly resisted Diogenes,
   Diogenes returned without success on the xxvi day of the said month
   Choiac, Coss. Arbetion and Lollianus, after iv months as aforesaid.

   IV. 5. Now Duke Syrianus, and Hilary the Notary, came from Egypt to
   Alexandria on the tenth day of Tybi (Jan. 6, 356) after Coss. Arbetion
   and Lollianus. And sending in front all the legions of soldiers
   throughout Egypt and Libya, the Duke and the Notary entered the Church
   of Theonas with their whole force of soldiers by night, on the xiii day
   of Mechir, during the night preceding the xiv. And breaking the doors
   of the Church of Theonas, they entered with an infinite force of
   soldiers. But bishop Athanasius escaped their hands, and was saved, on
   the aforesaid xiv of Mechir [3782] . Now this happened ix years iii
   months and xix days from the Bishop's return from Italy. But when the
   Bishop was delivered, his presbyters and people remained in possession
   of the Churches, and holding communion iv months, until there entered
   Alexandria the prefect Cataphronius and Count Heraclius in the month
   Pahyni xvi day, Coss. Constantius [3783] VIII and Julianus CÃ¦sar I
   (June 10, 356).

   V. 6. And four days after they entered [3784] the Athanasians were
   ejected from the Churches, and they were handed over to those who
   belonged to George [3785] , and were expecting him as Bishop. So they
   received the Churches on the xxi day of Pahyni. Moreover George [3786]
   arrived at Alexandria, Coss. Constantius [3787] IX, and Julianus CÃ¦sar
   II, Mechir xxx (Feb. 24, 357), that is, eight months and xi days from
   when his party received the Churches. So George [3788] entered
   Alexandria, and kept the Churches xviii whole months: and then the
   common people attacked him in the Church of Dionysius, and he was
   hardly delivered with danger and a great struggle on the i day of the
   month Thoth, Coss. Tatianus and Cerealis (Aug. 29, 358). Now George
   [3789] was ejected from Alexandria on the x [3790] day after the riot,
   namely v of Paophi (Oct. 2). But they who belonged to Bishop
   Athanasius, ix days after the departure of George, that is on the xiv
   of Pa[ophi], cast out the men of George [3791] , and held the Churches
   two months and xiv days; until there came Duke Sebastian from Egypt and
   cast them out, and again assigned the Churches to the party of George
   on the xxviii day of the month Choiac (Dec. 24).

   7. Now ix whole months after the departure of George from Alexandria,
   Paulus the Notary arrived Pahyni xxix, Coss. Eusebius, Hypatius (June
   23, 359), and published an Imperial Order on behalf of George, and
   coerced many in vengeance for him. And [ii years and] v months after,
   George came to Alexandria Athyr xxx (Coss. Taurus, and Florentius) from
   court (Nov. 26, 361), that is iii years and two months after he had
   fled. And at Antioch they of the Arian heresy, casting out the
   Paulinians from the Church, appointed Meletius. When he would not
   consent to their evil mind, they ordained Euzoius a presbyter of George
   [3792] of Alexandria in his stead.

   VI. 8. Now George, having entered Alexandria as aforesaid on the xxx
   Athyr, remained safely in the town iii days, that is [till] iii Choiac.
   For, on the iv day of that same month, the prefect Gerontius announced
   the death of the Emperor Constantius, and that Julianus alone held the
   whole Empire. Upon which news, the citizens of Alexandria and all
   shouted against George, and with one accord placed him under custody.
   And he was in prison bound with iron from the aforesaid iv day of
   Choiac, up to the xxvii of the same month, xxiv days. For on the xxviii
   day of the same month early in the morning, nearly all the people of
   that town led forth George from prison, and also the Count who was with
   him, the Superintendent of the building of the Church which is called
   CÃ¦sareum, and killed them both, and carried their bodies round through
   the midst of the town, that of George on a camel, but that of
   Dracontius, men dragging it by ropes; and so having insulted them, at
   about the vii hour of the day, they burnt the bodies of each.

   VII. 9. Now in the next....day of Mechir the x day of the month, after
   Coss. Taurus and Florentius (Feb. 4, 362), an order of the Emperor
   Julian was published commanding those things to be restored to the
   idols and temple attendants and the public account, which in former
   times had been taken away from them.

   10. But after iii days, Mechir xiv, an order was given of the same
   Emperor Julian, also of the Vicar Modestus, to Gerontius prefect,
   ordering all Bishops hitherto defeated by factions and exiled to return
   to their towns and provinces. Now this letter was published on the
   following day Mechir xv, while subsequently an edict also of the
   prefect Gerontius was published, by which the Bishop Athanasius was
   ordered to return to his Church. And xii days after the publication of
   this Edict Athanasius was seen at Alexandria, and entered the Church in
   the same month Mechir, xxvii day, so that there is from his flight
   which took place in the times of Syrianus and Hilary till his return,
   when Julianus....Mechir xxvii. He remained in the Church until Paophi
   xxvi, Coss. Mamertinus and Nevitta (Oct. 23, 362), viii whole months.

   11. Now on the aforesaid day, Paophi xxvii, he [the prefect] published
   an Edict of the Emperor Julianus, that Athanasius, Bishop, should
   retire from Alexandria, and no sooner was the Edict published, than the
   Bishop left the town and abode round about Thereu [3793] . Soon after
   his departure Olympus the prefect, in obedience to the same [3794]
   Pythiodorus, and those who were with him, most difficult persons, sent
   into exile Paulus and Astericius, presbyters of Alexandria, and
   directed them to live at the town of Andropolis.

   VIII. 12. Now Olympus the same prefect, in the month Mensor, xxvi day,
   Coss. Julianus Augustus IV. and Sallustius (Aug. 20, 363), announced
   that Julian the Emperor was dead, and that Jovianus a Christian was
   Emperor. And in the following month, Thoth xviii, a letter of the
   Emperor Jovianus came to Olympus the prefect that only the most high
   God should be worshipped, and Christ, and that the peoples, holding
   communion in the Churches, should practise religion. Moreover Paulus
   and Astericius, the aforesaid presbyters, returned from exile at the
   town of Andropolis, and entered Alexandria, on the x day of Thoth,
   after x months.

   13. Now Bishop Athanasius, having tarried as aforesaid at Thereon, went
   up to the higher parts of Egypt as far as Upper Hermopolis in the
   Thebaid, and as far as Antinoopolis. And while he was staying in these
   places, it was learned that the Emperor Julian was dead, and that
   Jovian a Christian was Emperor. So the Bishop entered Alexandria
   secretly, his arrival not being known to many, and went by sea to meet
   the Emperor Jovian, and afterwards, Church affairs being settled [3795]
   , received a letter, and came to Alexandria and entered into the Church
   on the xix day of Athyr [3796] Coss. Jovianus and Varronianus. From his
   leaving Alexandria according to the order of Julian until he arrived on
   the aforesaid xix day of Athyr [3797] after one year and iii months,
   and xxii days.

   IX. Now at CP. Eudoxius of Germanicia held the Church, and there was a
   division between him and Macedonius; but by means of Eudoxius there
   went forth another worse heresy from the spurious [teaching] of the
   Arians, Aetius and Patricius [3798] of NicÃ¦a, who communicated with
   Eunomius, Heliodorus, and Stephen. And Eudoxius adopting this,
   communicated with Euzoius, Bishop at Antioch, of the Arian sect, and
   they deposed on a pretext Seleucius [3799] and Macedonius, and Hypatian
   [3800] , and other xv Bishops belonging to them, since they would not
   receive Unlike' nor Creature of the Uncreated.' Now their Exposition is
   as follows:--

   Exposition of Patricius [3801] and Aetius, who communicated with
   Eunomius, Heliodorus, and Stephen.

   These are the attributes of God, Unbegotten, without origin, Eternal,
   not to be commanded, Immutable, All-seeing, Infinite, Incomparable,
   Almighty, knowing the future without foresight; without beginning
   [3802] . These do not belong to the Son, for He is commanded, is under
   command, is made from nothing, has an end, is not compared [with the
   Father], the Father surpasses Him...of Christ is found: as pertaining
   to the Father, He is ignorant of the future. He was not God, but Son of
   God; God of those who are after Him: and in this He possesses
   invariable likeness with the Father, namely He sees all things because
   all things...because He is not changed in goodness; [but] not like in
   the quality of Godhead, nor in nature. But if we said that He was born
   of the quality of Godhead, we say that He resembles the offspring of
   serpents [3803] , and that is an impious saying: and like as a statue
   produces rust from itself, and will be consumed by the rust itself, so
   also the Son, if He is produced from the nature of the Father, will
   consume the Father. But from the work, and the newness of work, the Son
   is naturally God, and not from the Nature, but from another nature like
   as the Father, but not from Him. For He was made the image of God, and
   we are out of God, and from God. Inasmuch as all things are from God,
   and the Son also, as if from something [else]. Like as iron if it has
   rust will be diminished, like as a body if it produces worms is eaten
   up, like as a wound if it produce discharges will be consumed by them,
   so [thinks] he who says that the Son is from the Nature of the Father;
   now let him who does not say that the Son is like the Father be put
   outside the Church and be anathema. If we shall say that the Son of God
   is God, we bring in Two without beginning: we call Him Image of God; he
   who calls Him out from God' Sabellianises. And he who says that he is
   ignorant of the nativity of God Manicheanizes: if any one shall say
   that the Essence of the Son is like the Essence of the Father
   unbegotten, he blasphemes. For just as snow and white lead are similar
   in whiteness but dissimilar in kind, so also the Essence of the Son is
   other than the Essence of the Father. But snow has a different
   whiteness [3804] ...

   Be pleased to hear that the Son is like the Father in His operations;
   like as Angels cannot comprehend the Nature of Archangels, let them
   please to understand, nor Archangels the Nature of a Cherubin, nor
   Cherubins the Nature of the Holy Spirit, nor the Holy Spirit the Nature
   of the Only-begotten, nor the Only-begotten the nature of the
   Unbegotten God.

   14. Now when the Bishop Athanasius was about coming from Antioch to
   Alexandria, the Arians Eudoxius, Theodore, Sophronius, Euzoius and
   Hilary took counsel and appointed Lucius, a presbyter of George, to
   seek audience of the Emperor Jovian at the Palace, and to say what is
   contained in the copies [3805] . Now here we have omitted some less
   necessary matter.

   X. 15. Now after Jovian, Valentinian and Valens having been somewhat
   rapidly summoned to the throne, a decree of theirs, circulated
   everywhere, which also was delivered at Alexandria on Pachon x, Coss.
   Valentinian and Valens (May 5, 365), to the effect that the Bishops
   deposed and expelled from their Churches under Constantius, who had in
   the time of Julian's reign reclaimed for themselves and taken back
   their Bishopric, should now be cast out anew from the Churches, a
   penalty being laid on the courts of a fine of ccc pounds of gold,
   unless that is they should have [ba]nished the Bishops from the
   Churches and towns. On which account at Alexandria great confusion and
   riot arose, insomuch that the whole Church was troubled, since also the
   officials were few in number with the prefect Flavian and his staff:
   and on account of the imperial order and the fine of gold they were
   urgent that the Bishops should leave the town; the Christian multitude
   resisting and gainsaying the officials and the judge, and maintaining
   that the Bishop Athanasius did not come under this definition nor under
   the Imperial order, because neither did Constantius banish him, but
   even restored him. Likewise also Julian persecuted him; he recalled
   all, and him for the sake of idolatry he cast out anew, but Jovian
   brought him back. This opposition and riot went on until the next month
   Payni, on the xiv day; for on this day the prefect Flavian made a
   report, declaring that he had consulted the Emperors on this very point
   which was stirred at Alexandria, and so they all became quiet in a
   short time [3806] .

   XI. 16. iv months and xxiv days after, that is on Paophi viii, the
   Bishop Athanasius left the Church secretly by night, and retired to a
   villa near the New River [3807] . But the prefect Flavian and Duke
   Victorinus not knowing that he had retired, on the same night arrived
   at the Church of Dionysius with a force of soldiers: and having broken
   the back door, and entered the upper parts of the house in search of
   the Bishop's apartment, they did not find him, for, not long before he
   had retired, and he remained, staying at the aforesaid property from
   the above day, Paophi viii, till Mechir vi, that is iv whole months
   (Oct. 5-Jan. 31). After this, the Imperial notary Bresidas, in the same
   month Mechir came to Alexandria with an Imperial letter, ordering the
   said Bishop Athanasius to return to Town, and hold the Churches as
   usual; and on the vii day of the month Mechir, after Coss. Valentinian
   and Valens, that is Coss. Gratian and Degalaifus, the said notary
   Bresidas with Duke Victorinus and Flavian the Prefect assembled at the
   palace and announced to the officers of the courts who were present,
   and the people, that the Emperors had ordered the Bishop to return to
   town, and straightway the said Bresidas the notary went forth with the
   officers of the courts, and a multitude of the people of the Christians
   to the aforesaid villa, and taking the Bishop Athanasius with the
   Imperial order, led him in to the Church which is called that of
   Dionysius on the vii day of the mouth Mechir.

   XII. 17. From Coss. Gratian and Dagalaifus (366) to the next
   consulships of Lupicinus and Jovinus (367) and that of [Valentinian II.
   and] Valens II. on Payni xiv (June 8, 368) in [this] Consulship xl
   [years of the Bishopric] of Athanasius are finished. Out of which
   [years] he abode at Treveri in Gaul [ii years iv months xi days [3808]
   , and in Italy and the West] xc months and iii days. At Alexandria
   [and] in uncertain places in hiding, when he was being harassed by
   Hilary the notary and the Duke, lxxii months and xiv days. In Egypt and
   Antioch upon journeys xv months and xxii days: upon the property near
   the new river iv months. The result will be exactly vi [3809] months
   and xvii years and [3810] xx days. Moreover, he remained in quiet at
   Alexandria xxii years and v months x days. But also, he twice stayed a
   little time outside Alexandria in his last journey and at Tyre and at
   CP. Accordingly, the result will be as I have stated above, xl years of
   the episcopate of Athanasius until Payni [x]iv, Coss. Valentinian and
   Valens. And in the following consulate of Valentinian and Victor, Payni
   xiv, i year, and in the following consulships of Valentinian [III] and
   Valens III Payni xiv, and in the following Consulships of Gratian and
   Probus, [and the next of Modestus and Arintheus], and another
   consulship of Valentinian [IV] and Valens IV, on Pachon viii he falls
   asleep (May 3, 373).

   XIII. 18. Now in the aforesaid consulship of Lupicinus and Jovinus,
   Lucius being specially desirous to claim for himself the episcopate of
   the Arians a long time after he had left Alexandria, arrived in the
   aforesaid consulship, and entered the town secretly by night on the
   xxvi day of the month Thoth (Sept. 24, 367): and as it is said, abode
   in a certain small house keeping in hiding for that day. But next day
   he went to a house where his mother was staying; and his arrival being
   known at once all over the town, the whole people assembled and blamed
   his entry. And Duke Trajanus and the Prefect were extremely displeased
   at his irrational and bold arrival, and sent officials to cast him out
   of the town. So the officials came to Lucius, and considering all of
   them that the people were angry and very riotous against him they
   feared to bring him out of the house by themselves, lest he should be
   killed by the multitude. And they reported this to the judges. And
   presently the judges themselves, Duke Trajan, and the Prefect Tatianus
   [came] to the place with many soldiers, entered the house and brought
   out Lucius themselves at the vii hour of the day, on the xxvii day of
   Thoth. Now while Lucius was following the judges, and the whole people
   of the town after them, Christians and Pagans, and of divers religions,
   all alike with one breath, and with one mind, and of one accord, did
   not cease, from the house whence he was led, through the middle of the
   town, as far as the house of the Duke, from shouting, and hurling at
   him withal insults and criminal charges, and from crying, Let him be
   taken out of the town.' However, the Duke took him into his house, and
   he stayed with him for the remaining hours of the day, and the whole
   night, and on the following the xxviii of the same month, the Duke
   early in the morning, and taking him in charge as far as Nicopolis
   [3811] , handed him over to soldiers to be escorted from Egypt.

   19. Now whereas Athanasius died on the viii of the month Pachon, the v
   day before he fell asleep, he ordained Peter, one of the ancient
   presbyters, Bishop, who carried on the Episcopate, following him in all
   things. After whom Timothy his B[rother] succeeded to the Episcopate
   for iv years. After him Theophilus from [being] deacon was ordained
   Bishop (385). The End.

   B.--The Festal Letters, and Their Index,

   Or Chronicon Athanasianum.

   ------------------------

   The latter document is from the hand, it would seem, of the original
   collector of the Easter Letters of Athanasius (yet see infr. note 6a).
   He gives, in a paragraph corresponding to each Easter in the episcopate
   of Athanasius, a summary of the calendar data for the year, a notice of
   the most important events, and especially particulars as to the Letter
   for the Easter in question, viz., Whether any peculiar circumstances
   attended its publication, and whether for some reason the ordinary
   Letter was omitted.

   The variations of practice which had rendered the Paschal Feast a
   subject of controversy from very early times (see Dict. Christ. Antiq.
   Easter) had given rise to the custom of the announcement of Easter at a
   convenient interval beforehand by circular letters. In the third
   century the Bishops of Alexandria issued such letters (e.g. Dionysius
   in Eus. H. E. vii. 20), and at the Council of NicÃ¦a, where the Easter
   question was dealt with (ad Afros. 2), the Alexandrian see was
   requested to undertake the duty of announcing the correct date to the
   principal foreign Churches as well as to its own suffragan sees. (This
   is doubted in the learned article Paschal Letters D.C.A. p. 1562, but
   the statement of Cyril. Alex. in his Prologus Paschalis' is express:
   cf. Ideler 2, 259. The only doubt is, whether the real reference is to
   Sardica, see Index xv. and Ep. 18.) This was probably due to the
   astronomical learning for which Alexandria was famous [3812] . At any
   rate we have fragments of the Easter letters of Dionysius and of
   Theophilus, and a collection of the Letters of Cyril [3813] .

   The Easter letters of Athanasius were, until 1842, only known to us by
   allusions in Jerome (de V. illustr. 87) and others, and by fragments in
   Cosmas Indicopleustes purporting to be taken from the 2nd, 5th, 6th,
   22nd, 24th, 28th, 29th, 40th, and 45th. Cardinal Mai had also shortly
   before the discovery of the Corpus' unearthed a minute fragment of the
   13th. But in 1842 Archdeacon Tattam brought home from the Monastery of
   the Theotokos in the desert of Skete a large number of Syriac mss.,
   which for over a century European scholars had been vainly endeavouring
   to obtain. Among these, when deposited in the British Museum, Cureton
   discovered a large collection of the Festal Letters of Athanasius, with
   the Index,' thus realising the suspicion of Montfaucon (Migne xxvi.)
   that the lost treasure might be lurking in some Eastern monastery.
   Another consignment of mss. from the same source produced some further
   portions, which were likewise included in the translation revised for
   the present volume [3814] .

   (1) Number of Festal Letters of Athanasius.--This question, which is of
   first-rate importance for the chronology of the period, must be
   regarded as settled, at any rate until some discovery which shall
   revolutionise all existing data. The number 45, which was the maximum
   known to antiquity [3815] , is confirmed by the Index, and by the fact
   that the citations from Cosmas (see above) tally with the order of the
   Letters in this Syriac version in every case where the letter is
   preserved entire, while Letter 39, preserved by a different writer,
   also tallies with the reference to it in the Index. It is therefore
   unassailably established on our existing evidence that the last Easter
   letter of Ath. was his 45th,' in other words that 45 is the full or
   normal number of his festal letters. This clinches the reckoning of the
   Index and Hist. Aceph. that he was bishop for 45 Easters (329-373
   inclusive), i.e. for parts of 46 years (328-373 inclusive). Moreover it
   corroborates, and is rivetted firm by, the statement of Cyril. Alex.
   Ep. 1, that Athan. graced the see of Alexandria fully 46 years.' Il le
   dit en voulant faire son eloge: de sorte qu'il y a tout lieu de croire
   qu'il n'a point passÃ© les 46 ans: car pour peu qu'il fust entrÃ© dans la
   47^me annÃ©e, S. Cyrille auroit dÃ» naturellement luy donner 47 ans
   [3816] .' So Tillemont (viii. 719), whose opinion is all the more
   valuable from the fact that he is unable to harmonise it with his date
   for the accession of Ath., and accordingly forgets, p. 720 (sub. fin.),
   what he has said on the previous page.

   But we observe that many of the 45 Letters are represented in the
   corpus' by blanks. This is doubtless often the result of accidental
   loss. But the Index informs us that in several years, owing to his
   adversities, the Pope was unable to write.' This however may be fairly
   understood to refer to the usual public or circular letter. Often when
   unable to write this, he sent a few cordial lines to some friend
   (Letter 12) or to the clergy (17, 18) or people (29? see notes there)
   of Alexandria, in order that the true Easter might be kept (cf. the
   Arian blunder in 340, Ind. xii, with the note to Serapion Letter 12
   from Rome). But occasionally the Index is either corrupt or mistaken,
   e.g. No. xiii, where the Pope is stated to have written no letter,
   while yet the Corpus' contains one, apparently entire and of the usual
   public kind. We may therefore still hope for letters or fragments for
   any of the missing' years.

   (2) The Festal Letters are fully worthy to rank with any extant
   writings of Athanasius. The same warmth, vigour, and simplicity
   pervades them as we find elsewhere in his writings, especially in such
   gems as the letter to Dracontius (Ep. 49). Their interest, however
   (apart from chronology), is mainly personal and practical. Naturally
   the use and abuse of Fast and Festival occupy a prominent place
   throughout. Repeatedly he insists on the joyfulness of Christian
   feasts, and on the fact that they are typical of, and intended to
   colour, the whole period of the Christian's life. We gather from Ep. 12
   that Lent was kept less strictly in Egypt than in some other Christian
   countries. He insists not only upon fasting, but upon purity and
   charity, especially toward the poor (Ep. 1. 11, cf. Ep. 47. 4, &c.). We
   trace the same ready command of Scripture, the same grave humour in the
   unexpected turn given to some familiar text (Ep. 39) as we are used to
   in Athanasius. The Eucharist is a feeding upon the Word (4. 3), and to
   be prepared for by amendment of life, repentance, and confession of sin
   (i.e. to God, Ep. 7. 10). Of special importance is the Canon of Holy
   Scripture in Ep. 39, on which see Prolegg. ch. iv Â§ 4.

   It should be observed that the interval before Easter at which notice
   was given varied greatly. Some letters (e.g. 1, 2, 20) by a natural
   figure of speech, refer to the Feast as actually come; but others (17,
   18) were certainly written as early as the preceding Easter. Letter 4
   was written not long before Lent, but was (Â§ 1) unusually late. The
   statement of Cassian referred to below (note to Ep. 17) is therefore
   incorrect at any rate for our period.

   (3) The Index to the Festal Letters.--This chronicle, so constantly
   referred to throughout this volume, is of uncertain date, but probably
   (upon internal evidence) only somewhat later' (Hefele, E. Tr. vol. ii.
   p. 50) than Athanasius himself. Its special value is in the points
   where it agrees with the Hist. Aceph. (supr. Prolegg. ch. v.), where we
   recognise the accredited reckoning of the Alexandrian Church as
   represented by Cyril and Proterius (see Tillem. ubi supr.). The writer
   undoubtedly makes occasional slips (cf. Index iii. with Letter iv. and
   p. 512, note 1, Index xiii. with Letter [3817] xiii.!), and the text
   would be a miracle if it had come down to us uncorrupt (see notes
   passim): but on the main dates he is consistent with himself, with the
   Chron. Aceph. and (so far as they come in contact) with the notices of
   the Alexandrian bishops above mentioned.

   The writer's method, however, must be attended to if we are to avoid a
   wrong impression as to his accuracy. Firstly, his year is not the
   Julian but the Egyptian year (infr. Table C) from Aug. 29 to Aug. 28.
   Each year is designated by the new consuls who come into office in the
   fifth month. Secondly, in each year he takes a leading event or events,
   round which he groups antecedent or consequent facts, which often
   belong to other years. Two or three examples will make this clear. (a)
   Year Aug. 30, 335-Aug. 28, 336: leading event, exile of Athanasius (he
   reaches CP. Oct. 30, 335, leaves for Gaul [Feb. 7], both in the same
   Egyptian year). Antecedent: His departure for Tyre July 11, 335, at end
   of previous Egyptian Year. (b) The eventful' year Aug. 337-Aug. 338:
   leading event, triumphant return of Athanasius from Gaul, Oct. 21, 337.
   Antecedent: death of Constantine on previous 22nd of May (i.e. 337
   [3818] ). (g) Year 342-3: leading event, Council of Sardica (summons
   issued, at any rate, before end of Aug. 343). Consequent events:
   temporary collapse of Arian party and recantation of Ursacius and
   Valens (344-347? Further examples in Gwatkin, Studies, p. 105). Bearing
   this in mind, the discriminating student will derive most important
   help from the study of the Index: when its data agree with those
   derived from other good sources, they must be allowed first-rate
   authority. This is the principle followed in the Prolegomena (ch. v.)
   and throughout this volume. On the main points in dispute, as strewn
   above, we have to reckon with a compact uniform chronological system,
   checked and counter-checked by careful calculations (Hist. Aceph.), and
   transmitted by two independent channels; in agreement, moreover, as
   concerns the prior and posterior limits, with the reckoning adopted by
   the successors of Athanasius in the see.

   N.B.--The translation of the Index and Festal Letters is revised by
   Miss Payne Smith from that contained in the Oxford Library of the
   Fathers.' A German translation by Larsow was published at Berlin 1852.
   The Latin Version (from an Italian translation) of Card. Mai is in
   Migne, xxvi. 1351 sqq.

   The following Tables bear specially on the Festal Index.

   Table C. The Egyptian Year.

   After the final settlement of Egypt by Augustus as a province of the
   Roman Empire, the use of the Julian form of computation was established
   in Alexandria, the first day of the new Calendar being fixed to the
   28th of August, the 1st of Thot of the year in which the innovation
   took place; from which period, six, instead of five, supplementary days
   were added at the end of every fourth year; so that the form of the
   Alexandrian year was as follows. The months from Phamenoth 5 (Mar. 1)
   onwards are unaffected by leap-year.

            25 February

   N.B.--In leap-years, the Diocletian year (see p. 503, note 4) began on
   the previous Aug. 30, which was accordingly the First of Thot, owing to
   the additional epagomenon' which preceded it. Accordingly all the
   months to Phamenoth inclusive begin a day late. Then, the Julian
   intercalary day coming in as Feb. 29, Pharmuthi and the succeeding
   months begin as shewn above. (See Ideler, vol. I, pp. 161, 164, also
   140, 142.)

   Paschal Letters.

   ------------------------

   N.B.--The Year of our Lord, the Golden Numbers, and Dominical Letter,
   and the date of Easter according to the Modern Reckoning, are added.
   The age of the Moon on Easter-day is apparently given from observations
   or reckoned by some lost system (see Index x. xxii.); in about one case
   out of three it varies from the modern reckoning, perhaps once or twice
   from corruption of text. The Epact is a day too little for 342, 344,
   361, 362, 363 (see Galle in Larsow;. F.B. 48, sqq.).

   [3812] So Leo Magnus (Ep. ad Marcian. Imp.) apud Ã†gyptios huius
   supputationis antiquitus tradita peritia.'

   [3813] We trace differences of opinion in spite of the authority of the
   Alexandrian Pope in Index' xii, xv, xxi, and Ep. 18.

   [3814] Further details in Migne, P.G. xxvi. 1339 sqq. and Preface (by
   Williams?) to Oxford Transl. of Fest. Epp. (Parker, 1854.)

   [3815] The very late Arabic Life of Ath. alone gives 47 (Migne xxv. p.
   ccli.), a statement which we may safely ignore in view of the general
   character of the document which is crowded with incredible trivialities
   and follies' (Montf.), outbidding by far the unparalleled rubbish'
   (id.) of the worst of the Greek biographies (see Migne xxv. p. liv.
   sq.).

   [3816] The italics are ours. Cf. Rufin. H. E. ii. 3, xlvi anno
   sacerdotii sui.'

   [3817] Some phenomena might suggest (Hefele, ii. 88, note) that the
   Index was originally prefixed to another collection of the letters, and
   was copied by a collector or transcriber of our present corpus; cf.
   Index xiii., note 17^b, and p. 527, note 1.

   [3818] Misunderstood by Hefele, vol. ii. p. 88 (E. Tra.).

   April 22.

   [3820] According to the usual rule, Easter would fall on March 23; see
   Letter 18, note 3.

   [3821] According to rule, Easter would fall on April 23, which perhaps
   was the day really observed, as it agrees with the age of the moon; but
   see note on Index No. xxi.

   Index.

   An Index of the months of each year, and of the days, and of the
   Indictions, and of the Consulates, and of the Governors in Alexandria,
   and of all the Epacts, and of those [days] which are named of the Gods
   [3823] ,' and the reason [any Letter] was not sent, and the returns
   from exile [3824] --from the Festal Letters of Pope Athanasius.

   The Festal Letters of Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria, which he sent
   year by year, to the several cities and all the provinces subject to
   him; that is, from Pentapolis, and on to Libya, Ammoniaca, the greater
   and the lesser Oasis, Egypt, and Augustamnica, with the Heptanomis of
   [3825] the upper and middle Thebais; [commencing] from the 44th [3826]
   year of the Diocletian Era, in which the Paschal Festival was on xvi
   [3827] Pharmuthi; xviii Kal. Mai; xviii Moon; when Alexander, his
   predecessor, having departed this life on xxii Pharmuthi [3828] , he
   [Athan.] succeeded him after the Paschal festival on xiv Pauni, Indict.
   i, Januarius and Justus being Consuls, the governor Zenius of Italy
   being the PrÃ¦fect of Egypt, Epact xxv; Gods, i.

   I. (Aug. 29, 328, to Aug. 28, a.d. 329.) In this year, Easter-day was
   on xi Pharmuthi; viii. Id. Ap.; xxii Moon; Coss. Constantinus Aug.
   viii, Constantinus CÃ¦s. IV; the same governor Zenius being PrÃ¦fect of
   Egypt; Indict. ii; Epact vi; Gods, ii. This was the first Letter he
   [Athan.] sent; for he was ordained Bishop in the preceding year after
   the Paschal feast, Alexander, as is known, having despatched one for
   that year, before he was released from life. This was in the 45th of
   the Diocletian era.

   II. (329-330.) In this year, Easter-day was on xxiv Pharmuthi; xiii
   Kal. Mai; xv Moon; Coss. Gallicianus, Symmachus; the governor
   Magninianus the Cappadocian being PrÃ¦fect of Egypt; Indict. iii; Epact
   xvii; Gods, iii. In this year he went through the Thebais.

   III. (330-331.) In this year, Easter-day was on xvi Pharmuthi; xviii
   Moon; iii Id. Ap.; Coss. Annius Bassus, Ablavius; the governor Hyginus
   [3829] of Italy, PrÃ¦fect of Egypt; Epact xxviii; Indict. iv. He sent
   this Letter while journeying on his return from the Imperial Court. For
   in this year he went to the Imperial Court to the Emperor Constantine
   the Great, having been summoned before him, on account of an accusation
   his enemies made, that he had been appointed when too young. He
   appeared, was thought worthy of favour and honour, and returned [3830]
   when the fast was half finished.

   IV. (331-332.) In this year, Easter-day was on xvii [3831] Pharmuthi;
   xx Moon; iv Non. Apr.; Epact ix; Gods, vi; Coss. Pacatianus,
   Hilarianus; the same governor Hyginus, PrÃ¦fect of Egypt; Indict. v. In
   this year he went through Pentapolis, and was in Ammoniaca.

   V. (332-333.) In this year, Easter-day was on xx Pharmuthi; xv Moon;
   xvii Kal. Mai; Epact xx; Gods, vii; Coss. Dalmatius, Zenophilus; the
   governor Paternus [3832] , PrÃ¦fect of Egypt; Indict. vi.

   VI. (333-334.) In this year, Easter-day was on xii Pharmuthi; xvii
   Moon; vii Id. Apr.; Indict. vii; Epact i; Gods, i; Coss. Optatus,
   Paulinus; the same governor Paternus [3833] PrÃ¦fect of Egypt. In this
   year he went through the lower country. In it he was summoned to a
   Synod, his enemies having previously devised mischief against him in
   CÃ¦sarea of Palestine; but becoming aware of the conspiracy, he excused
   himself from attending.

   VII. (334-335.) In this year, Easter-day was on xiv [3834] Pharmuthi;
   xx Moon; iii Kal. Ap.; Indict. viii; Epact xii; Gods, ii; Coss.
   Constantius [3835] , Albinus; the same governor Paternus, PrÃ¦fect of
   Egypt.

   VIII. (335-336.) In this year, Easter-day was on xxiii Pharmuthi, xx
   Moon; xiv Kal. Mai; Indict. ix; Epact xxiii; Gods, iv; Coss.
   Nepotianus, Facundus; the governor Philagrius, the Cappadocian, PrÃ¦fect
   of Egypt. In this year he went to that Synod of his enemies which was
   assembled at Tyre. Now he journeyed from this place on xvii Epiphi
   [3836] , but when a discovery was made of the plot against him, he
   removed thence and fled in an open boat to Constantinople. Arriving
   there on ii Athyr [3837] , after eight days he presented himself before
   the Emperor Constantine, and spoke plainly. But his enemies, by various
   secret devices, influenced the Emperor, who suddenly condemned him to
   exile, and he set out on the tenth of Athyr [3838] to Gaul, to Constans
   CÃ¦sar, the son of Augustus. On this account he wrote no Festal Letter.

   IX. (336-7.) In this year, Easter-day was on viii Pharmuthi; xvi Moon;
   iv [3839] Non. Ap.; Indict. x; Epact iv; Gods, v; Coss. Felicianus,
   Titianus; the governor Philagrius, the Cappadocian, PrÃ¦fect of Egypt.
   He was in Treviri of Gaul, and on this account was unable to write a
   Festal Letter.

   X. (337-8.) In this year, Easter-day was on xxx Phamenoth; vii Kal.
   Ap.; xix [3840] Moon, Indict. xi; Epact xv; Gods, vi; Coss. Ursus,
   Polemius; the governor Theodorus [3841] , of Heliopolis, PrÃ¦fect of
   Egypt. In this year, Constantine having died on xxvii Pachon [3842] ,
   Athanasius, now liberated, returned from Gaul triumphantly on xxvii
   [3843] Athyr. In this year, too, there were many events. Antony, the
   great leader, came to Alexandria, and though he remained there only two
   days, shewed himself wonderful in many things, and healed many. He went
   away on the third of Messori. [3844]

   XI. (338-9.) In this year, Easter-day was on xx Pharmuthi; xx Moon;
   xvii Kal. Mai; Epact xxvi; Gods, vii; Indict. xii; Coss. Constantius
   II, Constans I [3845] ; the governor Philagrius, the Cappadocian,
   PrÃ¦fect of Egypt. In this year, again, there were many tumults. On the
   xxii Phamenoth [3846] he was pursued in the night, and the next day he
   fled from the Church of Theonas, after he had baptized many. Then, four
   days after, Gregorius the Cappadocian entered the city as Bishop.

   XII. (339-340.) In this year, Easter-day was on xiv [3847] Pharmuthi;
   xv Moon; iii Kal. Ap.; Epact vii; Gods, ii; Indict. xiii; Coss.
   Acyndinus, Proclus; the same governor Philagrius, PrÃ¦fect of Egypt.
   Gregorius continued his acts of violence, and therefore [Ath.] wrote no
   Festal Letter. The Arians proclaimed [Easter] on xxvii Phamenoth, and
   were much ridiculed on account of this error. Then altering it in the
   middle of the fast, they kept it with us on iv [3848] Pharmuthi, as
   above. He [Athanasius] gave notice of it to the presbyters of
   Alexandria in a short note, not being able to send a letter as usual,
   on account of his flight and the treachery.

   XIII. (340-341.) In this year, Easter-day was on xxiv Pharmuthi; xvi
   Moon; xiii. Kal. Mai; Epact xviii; Gods, iii; Indict. xiv; Coss.
   Marcellinus, Probinus; the governor Longinus, of NicÃ¦a, PrÃ¦fect of
   Egypt. Augustamnica was separated. [3849] On account of Gregorius
   continuing in the city, and exercising violence, although this illness
   commenced, the Pope did not write a Festal Letter even this time [3850]
   .

   XIV. (341-2.) In this year, Easter-day was on xvi Pharmuthi; xx [3851]
   Moon; iii Id. Ap.; Epact xxix; Gods, iv; Indict. xv; Coss. Constantius
   III, Constans II; the governor Longinus of NicÃ¦a, PrÃ¦fect of Egypt.
   Because Gregorius was in the city, [though] severely ill, the Pope was
   unable to send [any Letter].

   XV. (342-3.) In this year, Easter-day was on i Pharmuthi; xv Moon; vi
   Kal. Ap.; Epact xi; Gods, v; Indict. i; Coss. Placidus, Romulus; the
   same governor Longinus, of NicÃ¦a, PrÃ¦fect of Egypt. In this year the
   Synod of Sardica was held [3852] ; and when the Arians had arrived,
   they returned to Philippopolis, for Philagrius gave them this advice
   there. In truth, they were blamed everywhere, and were even
   anathematised by the Church of Rome, and having written a recantation
   to Pope Athanasius, Ursacius and Valens were put to shame. There was an
   agreement made at Sardica respecting Easter, and a decree was issued to
   be binding for fifty years, which the Romans and Alexandrians
   everywhere announced in the usual manner. Again he [Athan.] wrote a
   Festal Letter.

   XVI. (343-4.) In this year, Easter-day was on xx Pharmuthi; xix Moon;
   xvii Kal. Mai; Epact xxi; Gods, vi[i], Coss. Leontius, Sallustius; the
   governor Palladius, of Italy, PrÃ¦fect of Egypt; Indict. ii. Being at
   Naissus on his return from the Synod, he there celebrated Easter [3853]
   . Of this Easter-day he gave notice in few words to the presbyters of
   Alexandria, but he was unable to do so to the country.

   XVII. (344-5.) In this year, Easter-day was on xii Pharmuthi; xviii
   Moon; vii. Id. Ap.; Epact ii; Gods, i; Indict. iii; Coss. Amantius,
   Albinus; the governor Nestorius of Gaza, PrÃ¦fect of Egypt. Having
   travelled to Aquileia, he kept Easter there. Of this Easter-day, he
   gave notice in few words to the presbyters of Alexandria, but not to
   the country.

   XVIII. (345-6.) In this year, Easter-day was on iv Pharmuthi; xxi
   [3854] Moon; iii Kal. Ap.; Epact xiv; Gods, ii; Indict. iv; Coss.
   Constantius [3855] Aug. IV, Constans Aug. III; the same governor
   Nestorius of Gaza, PrÃ¦fect of Egypt. Gregorius having died on the
   second of Epiphi [3856] , he returned from Rome and Italy, and entered
   the city and the Church. Moreover he was thought worthy of a grand
   reception, for on the xxiv Paophi [3857] , the people and all those in
   authority met him a hundred miles distant, and he continued in honour.
   He had already sent the Festal Letter for this year, in few words, to
   the presbyters.

   XIX. (346-7.) In this year, Easter-day was on xvii Pharmuthi xv. Moon;
   Prid. Id. Apr.; Epact xxv; Gods, iii; Indict. v; Coss. Rufinus,
   Eusebius; the same governor Nestorius of Gaza, PrÃ¦fect of Egypt. He
   wrote this Letter while residing here in Alexandria, giving notice of
   some things which he had not been able to do before.

   XX. (347-8.) In this year, Easter-day was on vii Pharmuthi; xviii Moon;
   iii Non. Ap.; Epact vi; Gods, v [3858] Indict. vi; Coss. Philippus,
   Salia; the same governor Nestorius of Gaza, PrÃ¦fect of Egypt. This
   Letter also he sent while residing in Alexandria.

   XXI. (348-9.) In this year, Easter-day was on xxx Phamenoth;...xix
   Moon,...vii Kal. Ap.; Epact xvii; Gods, vi; Indict. vii. But because
   the Romans refused, for they said they held a tradition from the
   Apostle Peter not to pass the twenty-sixth day of Pharmuthi, nor..the
   thirtieth of Phamenoth, xxi Moon,.................. [3859] , vii Kal.
   Ap.; Coss. Limenius, Catullinus; the same governor Nestorius of Gaza,
   PrÃ¦fect of Egypt. He sent this also while residing in Alexandria.

   XXII. (349-50.) In this year, Easter-day was on xiii Pharmuthi; xix
   Moon, the second hour; vi Id. Ap.; Epact xxviii; Gods, vii; Indict.
   viii; Coss. Sergius, Nigrianus; the same governor Nestorius of Gaza,
   PrÃ¦fect of Egypt. In this year, Constans was slain by Magnentius, and
   Constantius held the empire alone; then he wrote to the Pope [Athan.],
   telling him to fear nothing because of the death of Constans, but to
   confide in him as he had done in Constans while living.

   XXIII. (350-1.) In this year, Easter day was on v Pharmuthi; Moon
   xviii; Prid. Kal. Ap.; Epact ix; Gods, i; Indict. ix; the Consulship
   after that of Sergius and Nigrianus; the same governor Nestorius of
   Gaza, again PrÃ¦fect of Egypt.

   XXIV. (351-2.) In this year, Easter-day was on xxiv Pharmuthi; xviii
   Moon; xiii Kal. Mai, Epact xx; Gods, iii; Indict. x, Coss. Constantius
   Aug. V, Constantius CÃ¦sar I; the same governor Nestorius of Gaza,
   PrÃ¦fect of Egypt. Gallus was proclaimed CÃ¦sar [3860] , and his name
   changed into Constantius.

   XXV. (352-3.) In this year, Easter-day was on xvi Pharmuthi; xxi Moon;
   iii Id. Ap.; Epact i; Gods, iv; Indict. xi; Coss. Constantius Aug. VI,
   Constantius CÃ¦sar II; the governor Sebastianus of Thrace, prÃ¦fect of
   Egypt. In this year, Serapion [3861] , Bishop of Thmuis, and
   Triadelphus of Nicion, and the presbyters Petrus and Astricius, with
   others, were sent to the emperor Constantius, through fear of mischief
   from the Arians. They returned, having effected nothing. In this year,
   Montanus, Silentiarius of the Palace, [was sent]...against [the] [3862]
   Bishop, but, a tumult having been excited, he retired, having failed to
   effect anything.

   XXVI. (353-4.) In this year, Easter-day was on i [3863] Pharmuthi; xvii
   Moon; vi Kal. Ap.; Epact xii; Gods, v; Indict. xii; Coss. Constantius
   Aug. VII, Constantius CÃ¦sar III.; the same governor Sebastianus of
   Thrace, PrÃ¦fect of Egypt.

   XXVII. (354-5.) In this year, Easter-day was on xxi Pharmuthi; xviii
   Moon; xvi Kal. Mai; Epact xxiii; Gods, vi; Indict. xiii; Coss.
   Arbetion, Lollianus; the governor Maximus the Elder of NicÃ¦a, Prefect
   of Egypt. In this year, Diogenes, the Secretary of the Emperor, entered
   with the design of seizing the Bishop. But he, too, having raged in
   vain, went away quietly.

   XXVIII. (355-6.) In this year, Easter-day was on xii Pharmuthi; xvii
   Moon; vii Id. Ap.; Epact iv; Gods, i; Indict. xiv, Coss. Constantius
   Aug. VIII, Julianus CÃ¦sar I; the same governor Maximus the Elder of
   NicÃ¦a, PrÃ¦fect of Egypt, who was succeeded by Cataphronius of Byblus.
   In this year, Syrianus Dux, having excited a tumult in the Church on
   the thirteenth of Mechir, on the fourteenth [3864] at night entered
   Theonas with his soldiers; but he was unable to capture [Athanasius],
   for he escaped in a miraculous manner.

   XXIX (356-7.) In this year, Easter-day was on xxvii Phamenoth; xvii
   Moon; x Kal. Ap., Epact xv; Gods, ii; Indict. xv; Coss. Constantius
   Aug. IX, Julianus CÃ¦sar II; the same governor Cataphronius, of Byblus,
   PrÃ¦fect of Egypt, to whom succeeded Parnassius. Then Georgius entered
   on the thirtieth of Mechir, and acted with excessive violence. But
   Athanasius, the Bishop, had fled, and was sought for in the city with
   much oppression, many being in danger on this account. Therefore no
   Festal Letter was written [3865] .

   XXX. (357-8.) In this year, Easter-day was on xvii Pharmuthi; Prid. Id.
   Ap.; xvii Moon; Epact xxvi; Gods, iii; Indict. i; Coss. Tatianus,
   Cerealis; the governor Parius of Corinth, PrÃ¦fect of Egypt. Athanasius,
   the Bishop, lay concealed in the city of Alexandria. But Georgius left
   on the fifth of Paophi [3866] being driven away by the multitude. On
   this account, neither this year was the Pope able to send a Festal
   Letter.

   XXXI. (358-9.) In this year, Easter-day was on ix [3867] Pharmuthi;
   Prid. Non. Ap.; xx Moon; Epact vii; Gods, iv; Indict. ii; Coss.
   Eusebius, Hypatius; the same governor Parius, who was succeeded by
   Italicianus of Italy for three months; after him Faustinus, of
   Chalcedon. Neither this year did the Pope write [any Letter].

   XXXII. (359-60.) In this year, Easter-day was on xxviii Pharmuthi; ix
   Kal. Mai; xxi Moon; Epact xviii; Gods, vi; Indict. iii; Coss.
   Constantius Aug. X, Julianus CÃ¦sar III; the governor Faustinus, of
   Chalcedon, PrÃ¦fect of Egypt. This PrÃ¦fect and Artemius Dux, having
   entered a private house and a small cell, in search of Athanasius the
   Bishop, bitterly tortured EudÃ¦monis, a perpetual virgin. On this
   account no [Letter] was written this year.

   XXXIII. (360-1.) In this year, Easter-day was on xiii Pharmuthi, vi Id.
   Ap.; xvii Moon; Epact xxix; Gods, vii; Indict. iv; Coss. Taurus,
   Florentius; the same governor Faustinus [3868] , PrÃ¦fect of Egypt, who
   was succeeded by Gerontius the Armenian. He was unable to send [a
   Letter]. In this year, Constantius died [3869] , and Julianus holding
   the empire alone, there was a cessation of the persecution against the
   Orthodox. For commands were issued everywhere from the emperor
   Julianus, that the Orthodox ecclesiastics who had been persecuted in
   the time of Constantius should be let alone.

   XXXIV. (361-2.) In this year, Easter-day was on v [3870] Pharmuthi;
   Prid. Kal. Ap.; xxv Moon; Epact x; Gods, i; Indict. v; Coss.
   Mamertinus, Nevitta; the same governor Gerontius, who was succeeded by
   Olympus of Tarsus. In this year, in Mechir, Athanasius the Bishop
   returned to the Church, after his flight, by the command of Julianus
   Augustus, who pardoned all the Bishops and Clergy in exile, as was
   before said. This year, then, he wrote [a Letter].

   XXXV. (362-3.) In this year, Easter-day was on xxv Pharmuthi; xii Kal.
   Mai; xx Moon; Epact xxi; Gods, ii; Indict. vi; Coss. Julianus Augustus
   IV, Sallustius; the same governor Olympus, PrÃ¦fect of Egypt.
   Pythiodorus Trico of Thebes, a Philosopher, brought a decree of
   Julianus on the twenty-seventh of Paophi, and set it in action against
   the Bishop first, and uttered many threats. So he [Athan.] left the
   city at once, and went up to the Thebais. And when after eight months
   Julianus died, and his death was announced, Athanasius returned
   secretly by night to Alexandria. Then on the eighth of Thoth, he
   embarked [3871] at the Eastern Hierapolis, and met the emperor Jovian,
   by whom he was dismissed with honour. He sent this festal Letter to all
   the country, while being driven by persecution from Memphis to the
   Thebais, and it was delivered as usual.

   XXXVI. (363-4). In this year, Easter-day was on ix Pharmuthi; Prid.
   Non. Ap.; xvi Moon; Epact iii; Gods, iv; Indict. vii; Coss. Jovianus
   Aug., Varronianus; the governor Aerius, of Damascus, PrÃ¦fect; who was
   succeeded by Maximus of Rapheotis, and he again by Flavianus the
   Illyrian. In this year, the Pope returned to Alexandria and the Church
   on the twenty-fifth of Mechir. He sent the Festal Letter, according to
   custom, from Antioch to all the Bishops in all the province.

   XXXVII. (364-5.) In this year, Easter-day was on i Pharmuthi; v[i] Kal.
   Ap.; xix Moon; Epact xiv; Gods, v; Indict. viii; Coss. Valentinianus
   Aug. I, Valens Aug.; the same Flavianus, the Illyrian, being governor.
   We received the CÃ¦sareum; but again, the Pope being persecuted [3872]
   with accusations, withdrew [3873] to the garden of the new river. But a
   few days [3874] after, Barasides, the notary, came to him with the
   PrÃ¦fect and obtained an entrance for him into the Church. Then, an
   earthquake happening on the twenty-seventh of Epiphi [3875] , the sea
   returned from the East, and destroyed many persons, and much damage was
   caused.

   XXXVIII. (365-6.) In this year, Easter-day was on xxi Pharmuthi; xvi
   Kal. Mai; xx Moon; Epact xxv; Gods, vi; Indict. ix; in the first year
   of the Consulship of Gratianus, the son of Augustus, and Daglaiphus;
   the same governor Flavianus, PrÃ¦fect. On the twenty-seventh of Epiphi,
   the heathen made an attack, and the CÃ¦sareum was burnt and consequently
   many of the citizens suffered great distress, while the authors of the
   calamity were condemned and exiled. After this, Proclianus the
   Macedonian, became chief.

   XXXIX. (366-7.) In this year, Easter-day was on vi [3876] Pharmuthi;
   Kal. Ap.; xvi Moon; Epact vi; Gods, vii; Indict. x; Coss. Lupicinus,
   Jovinus; the same Proclianus being governor, who was succeeded by
   Tatianus of Lycia. In this year, when Lucius had attempted an entrance
   on the twenty-sixth of Thoth [3877] , and lay concealed by night in a
   house on the side of the enclosure of the Church; and when Tatianus the
   PrÃ¦fect and Trajanus Dux brought him out, he left the city, and was
   rescued in a wonderful manner, while the multitude sought to kill him.
   In this year he [Ath.] wrote, forming a Canon of the Holy Scriptures.

   XL. (367-8.) In this year, Easter-day was on xxv Pharmuthi; xii Kal.
   Mai; xvi Moon; Epact xvii; Gods, ii; Indict. xi; Coss. Valentinianus
   Aug. II, Valens Aug. II; the same governor Tatianus, PrÃ¦fect. He
   [Athan.] began to build anew the CÃ¦sareum, on the 6th of Pachon, having
   been honoured with an imperial command by Trajanus Dux. He also
   discovered the incendiaries, and immediately cleared away the rubbish
   of the burnt ruins, and restored the edifice in the month Pachon.

   XLI. (368-9.) In this year, Easter-day was on xvii [3878] Pharmuthi;
   Prid. Id. Ap.; xv Moon; Epact xxviii; Gods, iii; Indict. xii; Coss.
   Valentinianus (son of Augustus) I, Victor; the same Tatianus being
   governor. The Pope began to build that Church in Mendidium which bears
   his name, on the twenty-fifth [3879] of the month Thoth, at the
   beginning of the eighty-fifth year of the Diocletian Era.

   XLII. (369-70.) In this year, Easter-day was on ii Pharmuthi; v [3880]
   Kal. Ap.; xv Moon; Epact ix; Gods, iv; Indict. xiii; Coss.
   Valentinianus Aug. III, Valens Aug. III; the same Tatianus being
   governor, who was succeeded by Olympius Palladius, of Samosata. The
   Pope finished the Church, called after his name, at the close of the
   eighty-sixth year of the Diocletian Era; in which also he celebrated
   the dedication, on the fourteenth [3881] of Mesori.

   XLIII. (370-1.) In this year, Easter-day was on xxii Pharmuthi; xv Kal.
   Mai; xvi Moon; Epact xx; Gods, v; Indict. xiv; Coss. Gratianus Aug. II,
   Probus; the same Palladius being governor; who was succeeded as PrÃ¦fect
   of Egypt by Ã†lius Palladius, of Palestine, who was called Cyrus.

   XLIV. (371-2.) In this year, Easter-day was on xiii Pharmuthi; vi Id.
   Ap.; xix Moon; Epact i; Gods, vii [3882] , Indict. xv; Coss. Modestus,
   Arintheus; the same Ã†lius Palladius the governor, called Cyrus, PrÃ¦fect
   of Egypt.

   XLV. (372-3.) In this year, Easter-day was on v Pharmuthi; Prid. Kal.
   Ap.; xxi Moon; Epact xii; Gods, i; Indict. i; Coss. Valentinianus IV,
   Valens IV; the same governor Ã†lius Palladius, PrÃ¦fect of Egypt. At the
   close of this year, on the seventh of Pachon [3883] , he [Athan.]
   departed this life in a wonderful manner.

   The end of the heads of the Festal Letters of holy Athanasius, Bishop
   of Alexandria.

   I. Festal Letters.

   Letter I.--For 329. Easter-day xi Pharmuthi; viii Id. April; Ã†r.
   Dioclet. 45; Coss. Constantinus Aug. VIII. Constantinus CÃ¦s. IV;
   PrÃ¦fect. Septimius Zenius; Indict. II.

   Of Fasting, and Trumpets, and Feasts.

   Come, my beloved, the season calls us to keep the feast. Again, the Sun
   of Righteousness [3884] , causing His divine beams to rise upon us,
   proclaims beforehand the time of the feast, in which, obeying Him, we
   ought to celebrate it, lest when the time has passed by, gladness
   likewise may pass us by. For discerning the time is one of the duties
   most urgent on us, for the practice of virtue; so that the blessed
   Paul, when instructing his disciple, teaches him to observe the time,
   saying, Stand (ready) in season, and out of season [3885] '--that
   knowing both the one and the other, he might do things befitting the
   season, and avoid the blame of unseasonableness. For thus the God of
   all, after the manner of wise Solomon [3886] , distributes everything
   in time and season, to the end that, in due time, the salvation of men
   should be everywhere spread abroad. Thus the Wisdom of God [3887] ,'
   our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, not out of season, but in season,
   passed upon holy souls, fashioning the friends of God and the prophets
   [3888] ;' so that although very many were praying for Him, and saying,
   O that the salvation of God were come out of Sion [3889] !'--the Spouse
   also, as it is written in the Song of Songs, was praying and saying, O
   that Thou wert my sister's son, that sucked the breasts of my mother
   [3890] !' that Thou wert like the children of men, and wouldest take
   upon Thee human passions for our sake!--nevertheless, the God of all,
   the Maker of times and seasons, Who knows our affairs better than we
   do, while, as a good physician, He exhorts to obedience in season--the
   only one in which we may be healed--so also does He send Him not
   unseasonably, but seasonably, saying, In an acceptable time have I
   heard Thee, and in the day of salvation I have helped Thee [3891] .'

   2. And, on this account, the blessed Paul, urging us to note this
   season, wrote, saying, Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is
   the day of salvation [3892] .' At set seasons also He called the
   children of Israel to the Levitical feasts by Moses, saying, Three
   times in a year ye shall keep a feast to Me [3893] ' (one of which, my
   beloved, is that now at hand), the trumpets of the priests sounding and
   urging its observance; as the holy Psalmist commanded, saying, Blow
   with the trumpet in the new moon, on the [solemn] day of your feast
   [3894] .' Since this sentence enjoins upon us to blow both on the new
   moons, and on the solemn [3895] days, He hath made a solemn day of that
   in which the light of the moon is perfected in the full; which was then
   a type, as is this of the trumpets. At one time, as has been said, they
   called to the feasts; at another time to fasting and to war. And this
   was not done without solemnity, nor by chance, but this sound of the
   trumpets was appointed, so that every man should come to that which was
   proclaimed. And this ought to be learned not merely from me, but from
   the divine Scriptures, when God was revealed to Moses, and said, as it
   is written in the book of Numbers; And the Lord spake unto Moses,
   saying, Make to thee two trumpets; of silver shalt thou make them, and
   they shall be for thee to call the congregation [3896] ;'--very
   properly for those who here love Him. So that we may know that these
   things had reference to the time of Moses--yea, were to be observed so
   long as the shadow lasted, the whole being appointed for use, till the
   time of reformation [3897] .' For' (said He) if ye shall go out to
   battle in your land against your enemies that rise up against you
   [3898] ' (for such things as these refer to the land, and no further),
   then ye shall proclaim with the trumpets, and shall be remembered
   before the Lord, and be delivered from your enemies.' Not only in wars
   did they blow the trumpet, but under the law, there was a festal
   trumpet also. Hear him again, going on to say, And in the day of your
   gladness, and in your feasts, and your new moons, ye shall blow with
   the trumpets [3899] .' And let no man think it a light and contemptible
   matter, if he hear the law command respecting trumpets; it is a
   wonderful and fearful thing. For beyond any other voice or instrument,
   the trumpet is awakening and terrible; so Israel received instruction
   by these means, because he was then but a child. But in order that the
   proclamation should not be thought merely human, being superhuman, its
   sounds resembled those which were uttered when they trembled before the
   mount [3900] ; and they were reminded of the law that was then given
   them, and kept it.

   3. For the law was admirable, and the shadow was excellent, otherwise,
   it would not have wrought fear, and induced reverence in those who
   heard; especially in those who at that time not only heard but saw
   these things. Now these things were typical, and done as in a shadow.
   But let us pass on to the meaning, and henceforth leaving the figure at
   a distance, come to the truth, and look upon the priestly trumpets of
   our Saviour, which cry out, and call us, at one time to war, as the
   blessed Paul saith; We wrestle not with flesh and blood, but with
   principalities, with powers, with the rulers of this dark world, with
   wicked spirits in heaven [3901] .' At another time the call is made to
   virginity, and self-denial, and conjugal harmony, saying, To virgins,
   the things of virgins; and to those who love the way of abstinence, the
   things of abstinence; and to those who are married [3902] , the things
   of an honourable marriage; thus assigning to each its own virtues and
   an honourable recompense. Sometimes the call is made to fasting, and
   sometimes to a feast. Hear again the same [Apostle] blowing the
   trumpet, and proclaiming, Christ our Passover is sacrificed; therefore
   let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of
   malice and wickedness [3903] .' If thou wouldest listen to a trumpet
   much greater than all these, hear our Saviour saying; In that last and
   great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man
   thirst, let him come unto Me and drink [3904] .' For it became the
   Saviour not simply to call us to a feast, but to the great feast;' if
   only we will be prepared to hear, and to conform to the proclamation of
   every trumpet.

   4. For since, as I before said, there are divers proclamations, listen,
   as in a figure, to the prophet blowing the trumpet; and further, having
   turned to the truth, be ready for the announcement of the trumpet, for
   he saith, Blow ye the trumpet in Sion: sanctify a fast [3905] .' This
   is a warning trumpet, and commands with great earnestness, that when we
   fast, we should hallow the fast. For not all those who call upon God,
   hallow God, since there are some who defile Him; yet not Him--that is
   impossible--but their own mind concerning Him; for He is holy, and has
   pleasure in the saints [3906] . And therefore the blessed Paul accuses
   those who dishonour God; Transgressors of the law dishonour God [3907]
   .' So then, to make a separation from those who pollute the fast, he
   saith here, sanctify a fast.' For many, crowding to the fast, pollute
   themselves in the thoughts of their hearts, sometimes by doing evil
   against their brethren, sometimes by daring to defraud. And, to mention
   nothing else, there are many who exalt themselves above their
   neighbours, thereby causing great mischief. For the boast of fasting
   did no good to the Pharisee, although he fasted twice in the week
   [3908] , only because he exalted himself against the publican. In the
   same manner the Word blamed the children of Israel on account of such a
   fast as this, exhorting them by Isaiah the Prophet, and saying, This is
   not the fast and the day that I have chosen, that a man should humble
   his soul; not even if thou shouldest bow down thy neck like a hook, and
   shouldest strew sackcloth and ashes under thee; neither thus shall ye
   call the fast acceptable [3909] .' That we may be able to shew what
   kind of persons we should be when we fast, and of what character the
   fast should be, listen again to God commanding Moses, and saying, as it
   is written in Leviticus [3910] , And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
   In the tenth day of this seventh month, there shall be a day of
   atonement; a convocation, and a holy day shall it be to you; and ye
   shall humble your souls, and offer whole burnt-offerings unto the
   Lord.' And afterwards, that the law might be defined on this point, He
   proceeds to say; Every soul that shall not humble itself, shall be cut
   off from the people [3911] .'

   5. Behold, my brethren, how much a fast can do, and in what manner the
   law commands us to fast. It is required that not only with the body
   should we fast, but with the soul. Now the soul is humbled when it does
   not follow wicked opinions, but feeds on becoming virtues. For virtues
   and vices are the food of the soul, and it can eat either of these two
   meats, and incline to either of the two, according to its own will. If
   it is bent toward virtue, it will be nourished by virtues, by
   righteousness, by temperance, by meekness, by fortitude, as Paul saith;
   Being nourished by the word of truth [3912] .' Such was the case with
   our Lord, who said, My meat is to do the will of My Father which is in
   heaven [3913] .' But if it is not thus with the soul, and it inclines
   downwards, it is then nourished by nothing but sin. For thus the Holy
   Ghost, describing sinners and their food, referred to the devil when He
   said, I have given him to be meat to the people of Ã†thiopia [3914] .'
   For this is the food of sinners. And as our Lord and Saviour Jesus
   Christ, being heavenly bread, is the food of the saints, according to
   this; Except ye eat My flesh, and drink My blood [3915] ;' so is the
   devil the food of the impure, and of those who do nothing which is of
   the light, but work the deeds of darkness. Therefore, in order to
   withdraw and turn them from vices, He commands them to be nourished
   with the food of virtue; namely, humbleness of mind, lowliness to
   endure humiliations, the acknowledgment of God. For not only does such
   a fast as this obtain pardon for souls, but being kept holy, it
   prepares the saints, and raises them above the earth.

   6. And indeed that which I am about to say is wonderful, yea it is of
   those things which are very miraculous; yet not far from the truth, as
   ye may be able to learn from the sacred [3916] writings. That great man
   Moses, when fasting, conversed with God, and received the law. The
   great and holy Elijah, when fasting, was thought worthy of divine
   visions, and at last was taken up like Him who ascended into heaven.
   And Daniel, when fasting, although a very young man, was entrusted with
   the mystery, and he alone understood the secret things of the king, and
   was thought worthy of divine visions. But because the length of the
   fast of these men was wonderful, and the days prolonged, let no man
   lightly fall into unbelief; but rather let him believe and know, that
   the contemplation of God, and the word which is from Him, suffice to
   nourish those who hear, and stand to them in place of all food. For the
   angels are no otherwise sustained than by beholding at all times the
   face of the Father, and of the Saviour who is in heaven. And thus
   Moses, as long as he talked with God, fasted indeed bodily, but was
   nourished by divine words. When he descended among men, and God was
   gone up from him, he suffered hunger like other men. For it is not said
   that he fasted longer than forty days--those in which he was conversing
   with God. And, generally, each one of the saints has been thought
   worthy of similar transcendent nourishment.

   7. Wherefore, my beloved, having our souls nourished with divine food,
   with the Word, and according to the will of God, and fasting bodily in
   things external, let us keep this great and saving feast as becomes us.
   Even the ignorant Jews received this divine food, through the type,
   when they ate a lamb in the passover. But not understanding the type,
   even to this day they eat the lamb, erring in that they are without the
   city and the truth. As long as JudÃ¦a and the city existed, there were a
   type, and a lamb, and a shadow, since the law thus commanded [3917] :
   These things shall not be done in another city; but in the land of
   JudÃ¦a, and in no place without [the land of JudÃ¦a]. And besides this,
   the law commanded them to offer whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices,
   there being no other altar than that in Jerusalem. For on this account,
   in that city alone was there an altar and temple built, and in no other
   city were they permitted to perform these rites, so that when that city
   should come to an end, then those things that were figurative might
   also be done away.

   8. Now observe; that city, since the coming of our Savior, has had an
   end, and all the land of the Jews has been laid waste; so that from the
   testimony of these things (and we need no further proof, being assured
   by our own eyes of the fact) there must, of necessity, be an end of the
   shadow. And not from me should these things be learned, but the sacred
   voice of the prophet foretold, crying; Behold upon the mountains the
   feet of Him that bringeth good tidings, and publisheth peace [3918] ;'
   and what is the message he published, but that which he goes on to say
   to them, Keep thy feasts, O Judah; pay to the Lord thy vows. For they
   shall no more go to that which is old; it is finished; it is taken
   away: He is gone up who breathed upon the face, and delivered thee from
   affliction [3919] .' Now who is he that went up? a man may say to the
   Jews, in order that even the boast of the shadow may be done away;
   neither is it an idle thing to listen to the expression, It is
   finished; he is gone up who breathed.' For nothing was finished before
   he went up who breathed. But as soon as he went up, it was finished.
   Who was he then, O Jews, as I said before? If Moses, the assertion
   would be false; for the people were not yet come to the land in which
   alone they were commanded to perform these rites. But if Samuel, or any
   other of the prophets, even in that case there would be a perversion of
   the truth; for hitherto these things were done in JudÃ¦a, and the city
   was standing. For it was necessary that while that stood, these things
   should be performed. So that it was none of these, my beloved, who went
   up. But if thou wouldest hear the true matter, and be kept from Jewish
   fables, behold our Saviour who went up, and breathed upon the face, and
   said to His disciples, Receive ye the Holy Ghost [3920] .' For as soon
   as these things were done, everything was finished, for the altar was
   broken, and the veil of the temple was rent; and although the city was
   not yet laid waste, the abomination was ready to sit in the midst of
   the temple, and the city and those ancient ordinances to receive their
   final consummation.

   9. Since then we have passed beyond that time of shadows, and no longer
   perform rites under it, but have turned, as it were, unto the Lord; for
   the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is
   liberty [3921] ;'--as we hear the sacred trumpet, no longer slaying a
   material lamb, but that true Lamb that was slain, even our Lord Jesus
   Christ; Who was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and was dumb as a lamb
   before her shearers [3922] ;' being purified by His precious blood,
   which speaketh better things than that of Abel, having our feet shod
   with the preparation of the Gospel, holding in our hands the rod and
   staff of the Lord, by which that saint was comforted, who said [3923] ,
   Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me;' and to sum up, being in all
   respects prepared, and careful for nothing, because, as the blessed
   Paul saith, The Lord is at hand [3924] ;' and as our Saviour saith, In
   an hour when we think not, the Lord cometh;--Let us keep the Feast, not
   with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but
   with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Putting off the old
   man and his deeds, let us put on the new man [3925] , which is created
   in God,' in humbleness of mind, and a pure conscience; in meditation of
   the law by night and by day. And casting away all hypocrisy and fraud,
   putting far from us all pride and deceit, let us take upon us love
   towards God and towards our neighbour, that being new [creatures], and
   receiving the new wine, even the Holy Spirit, we may properly keep the
   feast, even the month of these new [fruits] [3926] .

   10. We [3927] begin the holy fast on the fifth day of Pharmuthi (March
   31), and adding to it according to the number of those six holy and
   great days, which are the symbol of the creation of this world, let us
   rest and cease (from fasting) on the tenth day of the same Pharmuthi
   (April 5), on the holy sabbath of the week. And when the first day of
   the holy week dawns and rises upon us, on the eleventh day of the same
   month (April 6), from which again we count all the seven weeks one by
   one, let us keep feast on the holy day of Pentecost--on that which was
   at one time to the Jews, typically, the feast of weeks, in which they
   granted forgiveness and settlement of debts; and indeed that day was
   one of deliverance in every respect. Let us keep the feast on the first
   day of the great week, as a symbol of the world to come, in which we
   here receive a pledge that we shall have everlasting life hereafter.
   Then having passed hence, we shall keep a perfect feast with Christ,
   while we cry out and say, like the saints, I will pass to the place of
   the wondrous tabernacle, to the house of God; with the voice of
   gladness and thanksgiving, the shouting of those who rejoice [3928] ;'
   whence pain and sorrow and sighing have fled, and upon our heads
   gladness and joy shall have come to us! May we be judged worthy to be
   partakers in these things.

   11. Let us remember the poor, and not forget kindness to strangers;
   above all, let us love God with all our soul, and might, and strength,
   and our neighbour as ourselves. So may we receive those things which
   the eye hath not seen, nor the ear heard, and which have not entered
   into the heart of man, which God hath prepared for those that love Him
   [3929] , through His only Son, our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ;
   through Whom, to the Father alone, by the Holy Ghost, be glory and
   dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

   Salute one another with a kiss. All the brethren who are with me salute
   you.

   Letter II.--For 330. Easter-day xxiv Pharmuthi; xiii Kal. Mai; Ã†ra
   Dioclet. 46; Coss. Gallicianus, Valerius Symmachus; PrÃ¦fect,
   Magninianus; Indict. iii.

   Again, my brethren, is Easter come and gladness; again the Lord hath
   brought us to this season; so that when, according to custom, we have
   been nourished with His words, we may duly keep the feast. Let us
   celebrate it then, even heavenly joy, with those saints who formerly
   proclaimed a like feast, and were ensamples to us of conversation in
   Christ. For not only were they entrusted with the charge of preaching
   the Gospel, but, if we enquire, we shall see, as it is written, that
   its power was displayed in them. Be ye therefore followers of me [3930]
   ,' he wrote to the Corinthians. Now the apostolic precept exhorts us
   all, for those commands which he sent to individuals, he at the same
   time enjoined upon every man in every place, for he was a teacher of
   all nations in faith and truth [3931] .' And, generally, the commands
   of all the saints urge us on similarly, as Solomon makes use of
   proverbs, saying, Hear, my children, the instruction of a father, and
   attend to know understanding; for I give you a good gift, forsake ye
   not my word: for I was an obedient son to my father, and beloved in the
   sight of my mother [3932] .' For a just father brings up [his children]
   well, when he is diligent in teaching others in accordance with his own
   upright conduct, so that when he meets with opposition, he may not be
   ashamed on hearing it said, Thou therefore that teachest others,
   teachest thou not thyself [3933] ?' but rather, like the good servant,
   may both save himself and gain others; and thus, when the grace
   committed to him has been doubled, he may hear, Thou good and faithful
   servant, thou hast been faithful in a little, I will set thee over
   much: enter into the joy of thy Lord [3934] .'

   2. Let us [3935] then, as is becoming, as at all times, yet especially
   in the days of the feast, be not hearers only, but doers of the
   commandments of our Saviour; that having imitated the behaviour of the
   saints, we may enter together into the joy of our Lord which is in
   heaven, which is not transitory, but truly abides; of which evil doers
   having deprived themselves, there remains to them as the fruit of their
   ways, sorrow and affliction, and groaning with torments. Let a man see
   what these become like, that they bear not the likeness [3936] of the
   conversation of the saints, nor of that right understanding, by which
   man at the beginning was rational, and in the image of God. But they
   are compared to their disgrace to beasts without understanding, and
   becoming like them in unlawful pleasures, they are spoken of as wanton
   horses [3937] ; also, for their craftiness, and errors, and sin laden
   with death, they are called a generation of vipers,' as John saith
   [3938] . Now having thus fallen, and grovelling in the dust like the
   serpent [3939] , having their minds set on nothing beyond visible
   things, they esteem these things good, and rejoicing in them, serve
   their own lusts and not God.

   3. Yet even in this state, the man-loving Word, who came for this very
   reason, that He might seek and find that which was lost, sought to
   restrain them from such folly, crying and saying, Be ye not as the
   horse and the mule which have no understanding, whose cheeks ye hold in
   with bit and bridle [3940] .' Because they were careless and imitated
   the wicked, the prophet prays in spirit and says, Ye are to me like
   merchant-men of Phoenicia [3941] .' And the avenging Spirit protests
   against them in these words, Lord, in Thy city Thou wilt despise their
   image [3942] .' Thus, being changed into the likeness of fools, they
   fell so low in their understanding, that by their excessive reasoning,
   they even likened the Divine Wisdom to themselves, thinking it to be
   like their own arts. Therefore, professing themselves to be wise, they
   became fools, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the
   likeness of the corruptible image of man, and birds, and four-footed
   beasts, and creeping things. Wherefore God gave them over to a
   reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient [3943] .'
   For they did not listen to the prophetic voice that reproved them
   (saying), To what have ye likened the Lord, and with what have ye
   compared Him [3944] ?' neither to David, who prayed concerning such as
   these, and sang, All those that make them are like unto them, and all
   those who put their trust in them [3945] .' Being blind to the truth,
   they looked upon a stone as God, and hence, like senseless creatures,
   they walked in darkness, and, as the prophet cried, They hear indeed,
   but they do not understand; they see indeed, but they do not perceive;
   for their heart is waxen fat, and with their ears they hear heavily
   [3946] .'

   4. Now those who do not observe the feast, continue such as these even
   to the present day, feigning indeed and devising names of feasts [3947]
   , but rather introducing days of mourning than of gladness; For there
   is no peace to the wicked, saith the Lord [3948] .' And as Wisdom
   saith, Gladness and joy are taken from their mouth [3949] .' Such are
   the feasts of the wicked. But the wise servants of the Lord, who have
   truly put on the man which is created in God [3950] , have received
   gospel words, and reckon as a general commandment that given to
   Timothy, which saith, Be thou an example to the believers in word, in
   conversation, in love, in faith, in purity [3951] .' So well do they
   keep the Feast, that even the unbelievers, seeing their order [3952] ,
   may say, God is with them of a truth [3953] .' For as he who receives
   an apostle receives Him who sent him [3954] , so he who is a follower
   of the saints, makes the Lord in every respect his end and aim, even as
   Paul, being a follower of Him, goes on to say, As I also of Christ
   [3955] .' For there were first our Saviour's own words, who from the
   height of His divinity, when conversing with His disciples, said, Learn
   of Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest to your
   souls [3956] .' Then too when He poured water into a basin, and girded
   Himself with a towel, and washed His disciples' feet, He said to them,
   Know what I have done. Ye call Me Master and Lord, and ye say well, for
   so I am. If therefore I, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet,
   ye also ought to wash one another's feet: for I have given you an
   example, that as I have done to you, ye also should do [3957] .'

   5. Oh! my brethren, how shall we admire the loving-kindness of the
   Saviour? With what power, and with what a trumpet should a man cry out,
   exalting these His benefits! That not only should we bear His image,
   but should receive from Him an example and pattern of heavenly
   conversation; that as He hath begun, we should go on, that suffering,
   we should not threaten, being reviled, we should not revile again, but
   should bless them that curse, and in everything commit ourselves to God
   who judgeth righteously [3958] . For those who are thus disposed, and
   fashion themselves according to the Gospel, will be partakers of
   Christ, and imitators of apostolic conversation, on account of which
   they shall be deemed worthy of that praise from him, with which he
   praised the Corinthians, when he said, I praise you that in everything
   ye are mindful of me [3959] .' Afterwards, because there were men who
   used his words, but chose to hear them as suited their lusts, and dared
   to pervert them, as the followers of HymenÃ¦us and Alexander, and before
   them the Sadducees, who as he said, having made shipwreck of faith,'
   scoffed at the mystery of the resurrection, he immediately proceeded to
   say, And as I have delivered to you traditions, hold them fast [3960]
   .' That means, indeed, that we should think not otherwise than as the
   teacher has delivered.

   6. For not only in outward form did those wicked men dissemble, putting
   on as the Lord says sheep's clothing, and appearing like unto whited
   sepulchres; but they took those divine words in their mouth, while they
   inwardly cherished evil intentions. And the first to put on this
   appearance was the serpent, the inventor of wickedness from the
   beginning--the devil,--who, in disguise, conversed with Eve, and
   forthwith deceived her. But after him and with him are all inventors of
   unlawful heresies, who indeed refer to the Scriptures, but do not hold
   such opinions as the saints have handed down, and receiving them as the
   traditions of men, err, because they do not rightly know them nor their
   [3961] power. Therefore Paul justly praises the Corinthians [3962] ,
   because their opinions were in accordance with his traditions. And the
   Lord most righteously reproved the Jews, saying, Wherefore do ye also
   transgress the commandments of God on account of your traditions [3963]
   .' For they changed the commandments they received from God after their
   own understanding, preferring to observe the traditions of men. And
   about these, a little after, the blessed Paul again gave directions to
   the Galatians who were in danger thereof, writing to them, If any man
   preach to you aught else than that ye have received, let him be
   accursed [3964] .'

   7. For there is no fellowship whatever between the words of the saints
   and the fancies of human invention; for the saints are the ministers of
   the truth, preaching the kingdom of heaven, but those who are borne in
   the opposite direction have nothing better than to eat, and think their
   end is that they shall cease to be, and they say, Let us eat and drink,
   for to-morrow we die [3965] .' Therefore blessed Luke reproves the
   inventions of men, and hands down the narrations of the saints, saying
   in the beginning of the Gospel, Since many have presumed to write
   narrations of those events of which we are assured, as those who from
   the beginning were witnesses and ministers of the Word have delivered
   to us; it hath seemed good to me also, who have adhered to them all
   from the first, to write correctly in order to thee, O excellent
   Theophilus, that thou mayest know the truth concerning the things in
   which thou hast been instructed [3966] .' For as each of the saints has
   received, that they impart without alteration, for the confirmation of
   the doctrine of the mysteries. Of these the (divine) word would have us
   disciples, and these should of right be our teachers, and to them only
   is it necessary to give heed, for of them only is the word faithful and
   worthy of all acceptation [3967] ;' these not being disciples because
   they heard from others, but being eye-witnesses and ministers of the
   Word, that which they had heard from Him have they handed down.

   Now some have related the wonderful signs performed by our Saviour, and
   preached His eternal Godhead. And others have written of His being born
   in the flesh of the Virgin, and have proclaimed the festival of the
   holy passover, saying, Christ our Passover is sacrificed [3968] ;' so
   that we, individually and collectively, and all the churches in the
   world may remember, as it is written, That Christ rose from the dead,
   of the seed of David, according to the Gospel [3969] .' And let us not
   forget that which Paul delivered, declaring it to the Corinthians; I
   mean His resurrection, whereby He destroyed him that had the power of
   death, that is, the devil [3970] ;' and raised us up together with Him,
   having loosed the bands of death, and vouchsafed a blessing instead of
   a curse, joy instead of grief, a feast instead of mourning, in this
   holy joy of Easter, which being continually in our hearts, we always
   rejoice, as Paul commanded; We pray without ceasing; in everything we
   give thanks [3971] .' So we are not remiss in giving notice of its
   seasons, as we have received from the Fathers. Again we write, again
   keeping to the apostolic traditions, we remind each other when we come
   together for prayer; and keeping the feast in common, with one mouth we
   truly give thanks to the Lord. Thus giving thanks unto Him, and being
   followers of the saints, we shall make our praise in the Lord all the
   day [3972] ,' as the Psalmist says. So, when we rightly keep the feast,
   we shall be counted worthy of that joy which is in heaven.

   8. We begin the fast of forty days on the 13th of the month Phamenoth
   (Mar. 9). After we have given ourselves to fasting in continued
   succession, let us begin the holy Paschal [3973] week on the 18th of
   the month Pharmuthi (April 13). Then resting on the 23rd of the same
   month Pharmuthi (April 18), and keeping the feast afterwards on the
   first of the week, on the 24th (April 19), let us add to these the
   seven weeks of the great Pentecost, wholly rejoicing and exulting in
   Christ Jesus our Lord, through Whom to the Father be glory and dominion
   in the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever. Amen.

   The brethren which are with me salute you. Salute one another with a
   holy kiss [3974] .

   Here endeth the second Festal Letter of the holy lord Athanasius,
   Bishop of Alexandria.

   Letter III.--For 331. Easter-day xvi Pharmuthi; iii Id. April; Ã†ra
   Dioclet. 47; Coss. Annius Bassus, Ablabius; PrÃ¦fect, Florentius;
   Indict. iv.

   Again, my beloved brethren, the day of the feast draws near to us,
   which, above all others, should be devoted to prayer, which the law
   commands to be observed, and which it would be an unholy thing for us
   to pass over in silence. For although we have been held under restraint
   by those who afflict us, that, because of them, we should not announce
   to you this season; yet thanks be to God, who comforteth the afflicted
   [3975] ,' that we have not been overcome by the wickedness of our
   accusers and silenced; but obeying the voice of truth, we together with
   you cry aloud in the day of the feast. For the God of all hath
   commanded, saying, Speak [3976] , and the children of Israel shall keep
   the Passover.' And the Spirit exhorts in the Psalm; Blow the trumpet in
   the new moons [3977] , in the solemn day of your feast.' And the
   prophet cries; Keep thy feasts, O Judah [3978] .' I do not send word to
   you as though you were ignorant; but I publish it to those who know it,
   that ye may perceive that although men have separated us, yet God
   having made us companions, we approach the same feast, and worship the
   same Lord continually. And we do not keep the festival as observers of
   days, knowing that the Apostle reproves those who do so, in those words
   which he spake; Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years
   [3979] .' But rather do we consider the day solemn because of the
   feast; so that all of us, who serve God in every place, may together in
   our prayers be well-pleasing to God. For the blessed Paul, announcing
   the nearness of gladness like this, did not announce days, but the
   Lord, for whose sake we keep the feast, saying, Christ, our Passover,
   is sacrificed [3980] ;' so that we all, contemplating the eternity of
   the Word, may draw near to do Him service.

   2. For what else is the feast, but the service of the soul? And what is
   that service, but prolonged prayer to God, and unceasing thanksgiving
   [3981] ? The unthankful departing far from these are rightly deprived
   of the joy springing therefrom: for joy and gladness are taken from
   their mouth [3982] .' Therefore, the [divine] word doth not allow them
   to have peace; For there is no peace to the wicked, saith the Lord
   [3983] ,' they labour in pain and grief. So, not even to him who owed
   ten thousand talents did the Gospel grant forgiveness in the sight of
   the Lord [3984] . For even he, having received forgiveness of great
   things, was forgetful of kindness in little ones, so that he paid the
   penalty also of those former things. And justly indeed, for having
   himself experienced kindness, he was required to be merciful to his
   fellow servant. He too that received the one talent, and bound it up in
   a napkin, and hid it in the earth, was in consequence cast out for
   unthankfulness, hearing the words, Thou wicked and slothful servant,
   thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not
   strawed; thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the
   exchangers, and on my return, I should have received mine own. Take
   therefore the talent from him, and give it to him that hath ten talents
   [3985] .' For, of course, when he was required to deliver up to his
   lord that which belonged to him, he should have acknowledged the
   kindness of him who gave it, and the value of that which was given. For
   he who gave was not a hard man, had he been so, he would not have given
   even in the first instance; neither was that which was given
   unprofitable and vain, for then he had not found fault. But both he who
   gave was good, and that which was given was capable of bearing fruit.
   As therefore he who withholdeth corn in seed-time is cursed [3986] ,'
   according to the divine proverb, so he who neglects grace, and hides it
   without culture, is properly cast out as a wicked and unthankful
   person. On this account, he praises those who increased [their
   talents], saying, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been
   faithful in a little, I will place thee over much; enter into the joy
   of thy Lord [3987] .'

   3. This was right and reasonable; for, as the Scripture declares, they
   had gained as much as they had received. Now, my beloved, our will
   ought to keep pace with the grace of God, and not fall short; lest
   while our will remains idle, the grace given us should begin to depart,
   and the enemy finding us empty and naked, should enter [into us], as
   was the case with him spoken of in the Gospel, from whom the devil went
   out; for having gone through dry places, he took seven other spirits
   more wicked than himself; and returning and finding the house empty, he
   dwelt there, and the last state of that man was worse than the first
   [3988] .' For the departure from virtue gives place for the entrance of
   the unclean spirit. There is, moreover, the apostolic injunction, that
   the grace given us should not be unprofitable; for those things which
   he wrote particularly to his disciple, he enforces on us through him
   [3989] , saying, Neglect not the gift that is in thee. For he who
   tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread; but the paths of the
   slothful are strewn with thorns;' so that the Spirit forewarns a man
   not to fall into them, saying, Break up your fallow ground, sow not
   among thorns [3990] .' For when a man despises the grace given him; and
   forthwith falls into the cares of the world, he delivers himself over
   to his lusts; and thus in the time of persecution he is offended [3991]
   , and becomes altogether unfruitful. Now the prophet points out the end
   of such negligence, saying, Cursed is he who doeth the work of the Lord
   carelessly [3992] .' For a servant of the Lord should be diligent and
   careful, yea, moreover, burning like a flame, so that when, by an
   ardent spirit, he has destroyed all carnal sin, he may be able to draw
   near to God who, according to the expression of the saints, is called a
   consuming fire [3993] .'

   4. Therefore, the God of all, Who maketh His angels [spirits],' is a
   spirit, and His ministers a flame of fire [3994] .' Wherefore, in the
   departure from Egypt, He forbade the multitude to touch the mountain,
   where God was appointing them the law, because they were not of this
   character. But He called blessed Moses to it, as being fervent in
   spirit, and possessing unquenchable grace, saying, Let Moses alone draw
   near [3995] .' He entered into the cloud also, and when the mountain
   was smoking, he was not injured; but rather, through the words of the
   Lord, which are choice silver purified in the earth [3996] ,' he
   descended purified. Therefore the blessed Paul, when desirous that the
   grace of the Spirit given to us should not grow cold, exhorts, saying,
   Quench not the Spirit [3997] .' For so shall we remain partakers of
   Christ [3998] , if we hold fast to the end the Spirit given at the
   beginning. For he said, Quench not;' not because the Spirit is placed
   in the power of men, and is able to suffer anything from them; but
   because bad and unthankful men are such as manifestly wish to quench
   it, since they, like the impure, persecute the Spirit with unholy
   deeds. For the holy Spirit of discipline will flee deceit, nor dwell in
   a body that is subject unto sin; but will remove from thoughts that are
   without understanding [3999] .' Now they being without understanding,
   and deceitful, and lovers of sin, walk still as in darkness, not having
   that Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world [4000]
   .' Now a fire such as this laid hold of Jeremiah the prophet, when the
   word was in him as a fire, and he said, I pass away from every place,
   and am not able to endure it [4001] .' And our Lord Jesus Christ, being
   good and a lover of men, came that He might cast this upon earth, and
   said, And what? would that it were already kindled [4002] !' For He
   desired, as He testified in Ezekiel [4003] , the repentance of a man
   rather than his death; so that evil should be entirely consumed in all
   men, that the soul, being purified, might be able to bring forth fruit;
   for the word which is sown by Him will be productive, some thirty, some
   sixty, some an hundred [4004] . Thus, for instance, those who were with
   Cleopas [4005] , although infirm at first from lack of knowledge, yet
   afterwards were inflamed with the words of the Saviour, and brought
   forth the fruits of the knowledge of Him. The blessed Paul also, when
   seized by this fire, revealed it not to flesh and blood, but having
   experienced the grace, he became a preacher of the Word. But not such
   were those nine lepers who were cleansed from their leprosy, and yet
   were unthankful to the Lord who healed them; nor Judas, who obtained
   the lot of an apostle, and was named a disciple of the Lord, but at
   last, while eating bread with the Saviour, lifted up his heel against
   Him, and became a traitor [4006] .' But such men have the due reward of
   their folly, since their expectation will be vain through their
   ingratitude; for there is no hope for the ungrateful, the last fire,
   prepared for the devil and his angels, awaits those who have neglected
   divine light. Such then is the end of the unthankful.

   5. But the faithful and true servants of the Lord, knowing that the
   Lord loves the thankful, never cease to praise Him, ever giving thanks
   unto the Lord. And whether the time is one of ease or of affliction,
   they offer up praise to God with thanksgiving, not reckoning these
   things of time, but worshipping the Lord, the God of times [4007] .
   Thus of old time, Job, who possessed fortitude above all men, thought
   of these things when in prosperity; and when in adversity, he patiently
   endured, and when he suffered, gave thanks. As also the humble David,
   in the very time of affliction sang praises and said, I will bless the
   Lord at all times [4008] .' And the blessed Paul, in all his Epistles,
   so to say, ceased not to thank God. In times of ease, he failed not,
   and in afflictions he gloried, knowing that tribulation worketh
   patience, and patience experience, and experience hope, and that hope
   maketh not ashamed [4009] .' Let us, being followers of such men, pass
   no season without thanksgiving, but especially now, when the time is
   one of tribulation, which the heretics excite against us, will we
   praise the Lord, uttering the words of the saints; All these things
   have come upon us, yet have we not forgotten Thee [4010] .' For as the
   Jews at that time, although suffering an assault from the tabernacles
   [4011] of the Edomites, and oppressed by the enemies of Jerusalem, did
   not give themselves up, but all the more sang praises to God; so we, my
   beloved brethren, though hindered from speaking the word of the Lord,
   will the more proclaim it, and being afflicted, we will sing Psalms
   [4012] , in that we are accounted worthy to be despised, and to labour
   anxiously for the truth. Yea, moreover, being grievously vexed, we will
   give thanks. For the blessed Apostle, who gave thanks at all times,
   urges us in the same manner to draw near to God saying, Let your
   requests, with thanksgiving, be made known unto God [4013] .' And being
   desirous that we should always continue in this resolution, he says, At
   all times give thanks; pray without ceasing [4014] .' For he knew that
   believers are strong while employed in thanksgiving, and that rejoicing
   they pass over the walls of the enemy, like those saints who said,
   Through Thee will we pierce through our enemies, and by my God I will
   leap over a wall [4015] .' At all times let us stand firm, but
   especially now, although many afflictions overtake us, and many
   heretics are furious against us. Let us then, my beloved brethren,
   celebrate with thanksgiving the holy feast which now draws near to us,
   girding up the loins of our minds [4016] ,' like our Saviour Jesus
   Christ, of Whom it is written, Righteousness shall be the girdle of His
   loins, and faithfulness the girdle of His reins [4017] .' Each one of
   us having in his hand the staff which came out of the root of Jesse,
   and our feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel [4018] , let us
   keep the feast as Paul saith, Not with the old leaven, but with the
   unleavened bread of sincerity and truth [4019] ;' reverently trusting
   that we are reconciled through Christ, and not departing from faith in
   Him, nor do we defile ourselves together with heretics, and strangers
   to the truth, whose conversation and whose will degrade them. But
   rejoicing in afflictions, we break through the furnace of iron and
   darkness, and pass, unharmed, over that terrible Red Sea. Thus also,
   when we look upon the confusion of heretics, we shall, with Moses, sing
   that great song of praise, and say, We will sing unto the Lord, for He
   is to be gloriously praised [4020] .' Thus, singing praises, and seeing
   that the sin which is in us has been cast into the sea, we pass over to
   the wilderness. And being first purified by the fast of forty days, by
   prayers, and fastings, and discipline, and good works, we shall be able
   to eat the holy Passover in Jerusalem.

   6. The beginning of the fast of forty days is on the fifth of Phamenoth
   (Mar. 1); and when, as I have said, we have first been purified and
   prepared by those days, we begin the holy week of the great Easter on
   the tenth of Pharmuthi (Apr. 5), in which, my beloved brethren, we
   should use more prolonged prayers, and fastings, and watchings, that we
   may be enabled to anoint our lintels with precious blood, and to escape
   the destroyer [4021] . Let us rest then, on the fifteenth of the month
   Pharmuthi (Apr. 10), for on the evening of that Saturday we hear the
   angels' message, Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is risen
   [4022] .' Immediately afterwards that great Sunday receives us, I mean
   on the sixteenth of the same month Pharmuthi (April 11), on which our
   Lord having risen, gave us peace towards our neighbours. When then we
   have kept the feast according to His will, let us add from that first
   day in the holy week, the seven weeks of Pentecost, and as we then
   receive the grace of the Spirit, let us at all times give thanks to the
   Lord; through Whom to the Father be glory and dominion, in the Holy
   Ghost, for ever and ever. Amen.

   Salute one another with a holy kiss. The brethren who are with me
   salute you. I pray, brethren beloved and longed for, that ye may have
   health, and that ye may be mindful of us in the Lord.

   Here endeth the third Festal Letter of holy Athanasius.

   Letter IV.--For 332. Easter-day vii Pharmuthi [4023] , iv Non. Apr.;
   Ã†ra Dioclet. 48; Coss. Fabius Pacatianus, MÃ¦cilius Hilarianus; PrÃ¦fect,
   Hyginus [4024] ; Indict. v.

   He sent this Letter from the Emperor's Court by a soldier [4025] .

   I send unto you, my beloved, late and beyond the accustomed time [4026]
   ; yet I trust you will forgive the delay, on account of my protracted
   journey, and because I have been tried with illness. Being hindered by
   these two causes, and unusually severe storms having occurred, I have
   deferred writing to you. But notwithstanding my long journeys, and my
   grievous sickness, I have not forgotten to give you the festal
   notification, and, in discharge of my duty, I now announce to you the
   feast. For although the date of this letter is later [4027] than that
   usual for this announcement, it should still be considered well-timed,
   since our enemies having been put to shame and reproved by the Church,
   because they persecuted us without a cause [4028] , we may now sing a
   festal song of praise, uttering the triumphant hymn against Pharaoh; We
   will sing unto the Lord, for He is to be gloriously praised; the horse
   and his rider He hath cast into the sea [4029] .'

   2. It is well, my beloved, to proceed from feast to feast; again festal
   meetings, again holy vigils arouse our minds, and compel our intellect
   to keep vigil unto contemplation of good things. Let us not fulfil
   these days like those that mourn, but, by enjoying spiritual food, let
   us seek to silence our fleshly lusts [4030] . For by these means we
   shall have strength to overcome our adversaries, like blessed Judith
   [4031] , when having first exercised herself in fastings and prayers,
   she overcame the enemies, and killed Olophernes. And blessed Esther,
   when destruction was about to come on all her race, and the nation of
   Israel was ready to perish, defeated the fury of the tyrant by no other
   means than by fasting and prayer to God, and changed the ruin of her
   people into safety [4032] . Now as those days are considered feasts for
   Israel, so also in old time feasts were appointed when an enemy was
   slain, or a conspiracy against the people broken up, and Israel
   delivered. Therefore blessed Moses of old time ordained the great feast
   of the Passover, and our celebration of it, because, namely, Pharaoh
   was killed, and the people were delivered from bondage. For in those
   times it was especially, when those who tyrannized over the people had
   been slain, that temporal feasts and holidays were observed in JudÃ¦a
   [4033] .

   3. Now, however, that the devil, that tyrant against the whole world,
   is slain, we do not approach a temporal feast, my beloved, but an
   eternal and heavenly. Not in shadows do we shew it forth, but we come
   to it in truth. For they being filled with the flesh of a dumb lamb,
   accomplished the feast, and having anointed their door-posts with the
   blood, implored aid against the destroyer [4034] . But now we, eating
   of the Word of the Father, and having the lintels of our hearts sealed
   with the blood of the New Testament [4035] , acknowledge the grace
   given us from the Saviour, who said, Behold, I have given unto you to
   tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy
   [4036] .' For no more does death reign; but instead of death henceforth
   is life, since our Lord said, I am the life [4037] ;' so that
   everything is filled with joy and gladness; as it is written, The Lord
   reigneth, let the earth rejoice.' For when death reigned, sitting down
   by the rivers of Babylon, we wept [4038] ,' and mourned, because we
   felt the bitterness of captivity; but now that death and the kingdom of
   the devil is abolished, everything is entirely filled with joy and
   gladness. And God is no longer known only in JudÃ¦a, but in all the
   earth, their voice hath gone forth, and the knowledge of Him hath
   filled all the earth [4039] .' What follows, my beloved, is obvious;
   that we should approach such a feast, not with filthy raiment, but
   having clothed our minds with pure garments. For we need in this to put
   on our Lord Jesus [4040] , that we may be able to celebrate the feast
   with Him. Now we are clothed with Him when we love virtue, and are
   enemies to wickedness, when we exercise ourselves in temperance and
   mortify lasciviousness, when we love righteousness before iniquity,
   when we honour sufficiency, and have strength of mind, when we do not
   forget the poor, but open our doors to all men, when we assist
   humble-mindedness, but hate pride.

   4. By these things Israel of old, having first, as in a figure, striven
   for the victory, came to the feast, for these things were then
   foreshadowed and typified. But we, my beloved, the shadow having
   received its fulfilment, and the types being accomplished, should no
   longer consider the feast typical, neither should we go up to Jerusalem
   which is here below, to sacrifice the Passover, according to the
   unseasonable observance of the Jews, lest, while the season passes
   away, we should be regarded as acting unseasonably [4041] ; but, in
   accordance with the injunction of the Apostles, let us go beyond the
   types, and sing the new song of praise. For perceiving this, and being
   assembled together with the Truth [4042] , they drew near, and said
   unto our Saviour, Where wilt Thou that we should make ready for Thee
   the Passover [4043] ?' For no longer were these things to be done which
   belonged to Jerusalem which is beneath; neither there alone was the
   feast to be celebrated, but wherever God willed it to be. Now He willed
   it to be in every place, so that in every place incense and a sacrifice
   might be offered to Him [4044] .' For although, as in the historical
   account, in no other place might the feast of the Passover be kept save
   only in Jerusalem, yet when the things pertaining to that time were
   fulfilled, and those which belonged to shadows had passed away, and the
   preaching of the Gospel was about to extend everywhere; when indeed the
   disciples were spreading the feast in all places, they asked the
   Saviour, Where wilt Thou that we shall make ready?' The Saviour also,
   since He was changing the typical for the spiritual, promised them that
   they should no longer eat the flesh of a lamb, but His own, saying,
   Take, eat and drink; this is My body, and My blood [4045] .' When we
   are thus nourished by these things, we also, my beloved, shall truly
   keep the feast of the Passover.

   5. We begin on the first of Pharmuthi (Mar. 27), and rest on the sixth
   of the same month (Apr. 1), on the evening of the seventh day; and the
   holy first day of the week having risen upon us on the seventh of the
   same Pharmuthi (Apr. 2), celebrate we too the days of holy Pentecost
   following thereon, shewing forth through them the world to come [4046]
   , so that henceforth we may be with Christ for ever, praising God over
   all in Christ Jesus, and through Him, with all saints, we say unto the
   Lord, Amen. Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the brethren who
   are with me salute you. We have sent this letter from the Court, by the
   hand of an attendant officer [4047] , to whom it was given by Ablavius
   [4048] , the PrÃ¦fect of the PrÃ¦torium, who fears God in truth. For I am
   at the Court, having been summoned by the emperor Constantine to see
   him. But the Meletians, who were present there, being envious, sought
   our ruin before the Emperor. But they were put to shame and driven away
   thence as calumniators, being confuted by many things. Those who were
   driven away were Callinicus, Ision, EudÃ¦mon, and Geloeus [4049]
   Hieracammon, who, on account of the shame of his name, calls himself
   Eulogius.

   Here endeth the fourth Festal Letter of holy Athanasius.

   Letter V.--For 333. Easter-day [4050] , Coss. Dalmatius and Zenophilus;
   PrÃ¦fect, Paternus [4051] ; vi Indict.; xvii Kal. Maii, xx Pharmuthi; xv
   Moon; vii Gods; Ã†ra Dioclet. 49.

   We duly proceed, my brethren, from feasts to feasts, duly from prayers
   to prayers, we advance from fasts to fasts, and join holy-days to
   holy-days. Again the time has arrived which brings to us a new
   beginning [4052] , even the announcement of the blessed Passover, in
   which the Lord was sacrificed. We eat, as it were, the food of life,
   and constantly thirsting we delight our souls at all times, as from a
   fountain, in His precious blood. For we continually and ardently
   desire; He stands ready for those who thirst; and for those who thirst
   there is the word of our Saviour, which, in His loving-kindness, He
   uttered on the day of the feast; If any man thirst, let him come to Me
   and drink [4053] .' Nor was it then alone when any one drew near to
   Him, that He cured his thirst; but whenever any one seeks, there is
   free access for him to the Saviour. For the grace of the feast is not
   limited to one time, nor does its splendid brilliancy decline; but it
   is always near, enlightening the minds of those who earnestly desire it
   [4054] . For therein is constant virtue, for those who are illuminated
   in their minds, and meditate on the divine Scriptures day and night,
   like the man to whom a blessing is given, as it is written in the
   sacred Psalms; Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of
   the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of
   corrupters. But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in His law
   doth he meditate day and night [4055] .' For it is not the sun, or the
   moon, or the host of those other stars which illumines him, but he
   glitters with the high effulgence of God over all.

   2. For it is God, my beloved, even the God Who at first established the
   feast for us, Who vouchsafes the celebration of it year by year. He
   both brought about the slaying of His Son for salvation, and gave us
   this reason for the holy feast, to which every year bears witness, as
   often as at this season the feast is proclaimed. This also leads us on
   from the cross through this world to that which is before us, and God
   produces even now from it the joy of glorious salvation, bringing us to
   the same assembly, and in every place uniting all of us in spirit;
   appointing us common prayers, and a common grace proceeding from the
   feast. For this is the marvel of His loving-kindness, that He should
   gather together in the same place those who are at a distance; and make
   those who appear to be far off in the body, to be near together in
   unity of spirit.

   3. Wherefore then, my beloved, do we not acknowledge the grace as
   becometh the feast? Wherefore do we not make a return to our
   Benefactor? It is indeed impossible to make an adequate return to God;
   still, it is a wicked thing for us who receive the gracious gift, not
   to acknowledge it. Nature itself manifests our inability; but our own
   will reproves our unthankfulness. Therefore the blessed Paul, when
   admiring the greatness of the gift of God, said, And who is sufficient
   for these things [4056] ?' For He made the world free by the blood of
   the Saviour; then, again, He has caused the grave to be trodden down by
   the Saviour's death, and furnished a way to the heavenly gates free
   from obstacles to those who are going up [4057] . Wherefore, one of the
   saints, while he acknowledged the grace, but was insufficient to repay
   it, said, What shall I render unto the Lord for all He has done unto me
   [4058] ?' For instead of death he had received life, instead of bondage
   [4059] , freedom, and instead of the grave, the kingdom of heaven. For
   of old time, death reigned from Adam to Moses;' but now the divine
   voice hath said, To-day shalt thou be with Me in Paradise.' And the
   saints, being sensible of this, said, Except the Lord had helped me, my
   soul had almost dwelt in hell. [4060] .' Besides all this, being
   powerless to make a return, he yet acknowledged the gift, and wrote
   finally, saying, I will take the cup of salvation, and call on the name
   of the Lord; precious in His sight is the death of His saints [4061] .'

   With regard to the cup, the Lord said, Are ye able to drink of that cup
   which I am about to drink of?' And when the disciples assented, the
   Lord said, Ye shall indeed drink of My cup; but that ye should sit on
   My right hand, and on My left, is not Mine to give; but to those for
   whom it is prepared [4062] .' Therefore, my beloved, let us be sensible
   of the gift, though we are found insufficient to repay it. As we have
   ability, let us meet the occasion. For although nature is not able,
   with things unworthy of the Word, to return a recompense for such
   benefits, yet let us render Him thanks while we persevere in piety. And
   how can we more abide in piety than when we acknowledge God, Who in His
   love to mankind has bestowed on us such benefits? (For thus we shall
   obediently keep the law, and observe its commandments. And, further, we
   shall not, as unthankful persons, be accounted transgressors of the
   law, or do those things which ought to be hated, for the Lord loveth
   the thankful); when too we offer ourselves to the Lord, like the
   saints, when we subscribe ourselves entirely [as] living henceforth not
   to ourselves, but to the Lord Who died for us, as also the blessed Paul
   did, when he said, I am crucified with Christ, yet I live; yet not I,
   but Christ liveth in me [4063] .'

   4. Now our life, my brethren, truly consists in our denying all bodily
   things, and continuing stedfast in those only of our Saviour. Therefore
   the present season requires of us, that we should not only utter such
   words, but should also imitate the deeds of the saints. But we imitate
   them, when we acknowledge Him who died, and no longer live unto
   ourselves, but Christ henceforth lives in us; when we render a
   recompense to the Lord to the utmost of our power, though when we make
   a return we give nothing of our own, but those things which we have
   before received from Him, this being especially of His grace, that He
   should require, as from us, His own gifts. He bears witness to this
   when He says, My offerings are My own gifts [4064] .' That is, those
   things which you give Me are yours, as having received them from Me,
   but they are the gifts of God. And let us offer to the Lord every
   virtue, and that true holiness which is in Him, and in piety let us
   keep the feast to Him with those things which He has hallowed for us.
   Let us thus engage in the holy fasts, as having been prescribed by Him,
   and by means of which we find the way to God. But let us not be like
   the heathen, or the ignorant Jews, or as the heretics and schismatics
   of the present time. For the heathen think the accomplishment of the
   feast is in the abundance of food; the Jews, erring in the type and
   shadow, think it still such; the schismatics keep it in separate
   places, and with vain imaginations. But let us, my brethren, be
   superior to the heathen, in keeping the feast with sincerity of soul,
   and purity of body; to the Jews, in no longer receiving the type and
   the shadow, but as having been gloriously illumined with the light of
   truth, and as looking upon the Sun of Righteousness [4065] ; to the
   schismatics, in not rending the coat of Christ, but in one house, even
   in the Catholic Church, let us eat the Passover of the Lord, Who, by
   ordaining His holy laws, guided us towards virtue, and counselled the
   abstinence of this feast. For the Passover is indeed abstinence from
   evil for exercise of virtue, and a departure from death unto life. This
   may be learnt even from the type of old time. For then they toiled
   earnestly to pass from Egypt to Jerusalem, but now we depart from death
   to life; they then passed from Pharaoh to Moses, but now we rise from
   the devil to the Saviour. And as, at that time, the type of deliverance
   bore witness every year, so now we commemorate our salvation. We fast
   meditating on death, that we may be able to live; and we watch, not as
   mourners, but as they that wait for the Lord, when He shall have
   returned from the wedding, so that we may vie with each other in the
   triumph, hastening to announce the sign of victory over death.

   5. Would therefore, O my beloved, that as the word requires, we might
   here so govern ourselves at all times and entirely, and so live, as
   never to forget the noble acts of God, nor to depart from the practice
   of virtue! As also the Apostolic voice exhorts; Remember Jesus Christ,
   that He rose from the dead [4066] .' Not that any limited season of
   remembrance was appointed, for at all times He should be in our
   thoughts. But because of the slothfulness of many, we delay from day to
   day. Let us then begin in these days. To this end a time of remembrance
   is permitted, that it may show forth to the saints the reward of their
   calling, and may exhort the careless while reproving them [4067] .
   Therefore in all the remaining days, let us persevere in virtuous
   conduct, repenting as is our duty, of all that we have neglected,
   whatever it may be; for there is no one free from defilement, though
   his course may have been but one hour on the earth, as Job, that man of
   surpassing fortitude, testifies. But, stretching forth to those things
   that are to come [4068] ,' let us pray that we may not eat the Passover
   unworthily, lest we be exposed to dangers. For to those who keep the
   feast in purity, the Passover is heavenly food; but to those who
   observe it profanely and contemptuously, it is a danger and reproach.
   For it is written, Whosoever shall eat and drink unworthily, is guilty
   of the death of our Lord [4069] .' Wherefore, let us not merely proceed
   to perform the festal rites, but let us be prepared to draw near to the
   divine Lamb, and to touch heavenly food. Let us cleanse our hands, let
   us purify the body. Let us keep our whole mind from guile; not giving
   up ourselves to excess, and to lusts, but occupying ourselves entirely
   with our Lord, and with divine doctrines; so that, being altogether
   pure, we may be able to partake of the Word. [4070]

   6. We begin the holy fast on the fourteenth of Pharmuthi (Apr. 9), on
   the [first] evening of the week [4071] ; and having ceased on the
   nineteenth of the same month Pharmuthi (Apr. 14), the first day of the
   holy week dawns upon us on the twentieth of the same month Pharmuthi
   (Apr. 15), to which we join the seven weeks of Pentecost; with prayers,
   and fellowship with our neighbour, and love towards one another, and
   that peaceable will which is above all. For so shall we be heirs of the
   kingdom of heaven, through our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom to the
   Father be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. All the brethren
   who are with me salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.

   Here endeth the fifth Festal Letter of holy Athanasius.

   Letter VI.--For 334. Easter-day, xii Pharmuthi, vii Id. April; xvii
   Moon; Ã†ra Dioclet. 50; Coss. Optatus Patricius, Anicius Paulinus;
   PrÃ¦fect, Philagrius [4072] , the Cappadocian; vii Indict.

   Now again, my beloved, has God brought us to the season of the feast,
   and through His loving-kindness we have reached the period of assembly
   for it. For that God who brought Israel out of Egypt, even He at this
   time calls us to the feast, saying by Moses, Observe the month of new
   fruits [4073] , and keep the Passover to the Lord thy God [4074] :' and
   by the prophet, Keep thy feasts, O Judah; pay to the Lord thy vows
   [4075] .' If then God Himself loves the feast, and calls us to it, it
   is not right, my brethren, that it should be delayed, or observed
   carelessly; but with alacrity and zeal we should come to it, so that
   having begun joyfully here, we may also receive an earnest of that
   heavenly feast. For if we diligently celebrate the feast here, we shall
   doubtless receive the perfect joy which is in heaven, as the Lord says;
   With desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I
   suffer. For I say unto you, that I will not eat it, until it is
   fulfilled with you in the kingdom of God [4076] .' Now we eat it if,
   understanding the reason of the feast, and acknowledging the Deliverer,
   we conduct ourselves in accordance with His grace, as Paul saith; So
   that we may keep the Feast, not with old leaven, neither with the
   leaven of wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and
   truth [4077] .' For the Lord died in those days, that we should no
   longer do the deeds of death. He gave His life, that we might preserve
   our own from the snares of the devil. And, what is most wonderful, the
   Word became flesh, that we should no longer live in the flesh, but in
   spirit should worship God, who is Spirit. He who is not so disposed,
   abuses the days, and does not keep the feast, but like an unthankful
   person finds fault with the grace, and honours the days overmuch, while
   he does not supplicate the Lord who in those days redeemed him. Let him
   by all means hear, though fancying that he keeps the feast, the
   Apostolic voice reproving him; Ye observe days, and months, and times,
   and years: I fear lest I have laboured among you in vain [4078] .'

   2. For the feast is not on account of the days; but for the Lord's
   sake, who then suffered for us, we celebrate it, for our Passover
   Christ, is sacrificed [4079] .' Even as Moses, when teaching Israel not
   to consider the feast as pertaining to the days, but to the Lord, said,
   It is the Lord's Passover [4080] .' To the Jews, when they thought they
   were keeping the Passover, because they persecuted the Lord, the feast
   was useless; since it no longer bore the name of the Lord, even
   according to their own testimony. It was not the Passover of the Lord,
   but that of the Jews [4081] . The Passover was named after the Jews, my
   brethren, because they denied the Lord of the Passover. On this
   account, the Lord, turning away His face from such a doctrine of
   theirs, saith, Your new moons and your sabbaths My soul hateth [4082]
   .'

   3. So now, those who keep the Passover in like manner, the Lord again
   reproves, as He did those lepers who were cleansed, when He loved the
   one as thankful, but was angry with the others as ungrateful, because
   they did not acknowledge their Deliverer, but thought more of the cure
   of the leprosy than of Him who healed them. But one of them when he saw
   that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,
   and fell on his face at the feet of Jesus giving Him thanks; and he was
   a Samaritan. And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but
   those nine--whence are there none found who returned to give glory to
   God, but this stranger [4083] ?' And there was more given to him than
   to the rest; for being cleansed from his leprosy, he heard from the
   Lord, Arise, go thy way, thy faith hath saved thee [4084] .' For he who
   gives thanks, and he who glorifies, have kindred feelings, in that they
   bless their Helper for the benefits they have received. So the Apostle
   exhorts all men to this, saying, Glorify God with your body;' and the
   prophet commands, saying, Give glory to God.' Although testimony was
   borne by Caiaphas [4085] against our Redeemer, and He was set at nought
   by the Jews, and was condemned by Pilate in those days, yet exalted
   exceedingly and most mighty was the voice of the Father which came to
   Him; I have glorified, and will glorify again [4086] .' For those
   things which He suffered for our sake have passed away; but those which
   belong to Him as the Saviour remain for ever.

   4. But in our commemoration of these things, my brethren, let us not be
   occupied with meats, but let us glorify the Lord, let us become fools
   for Him who died for us, even as Paul said; For if we are foolish, it
   is to God; or if we are sober-minded, it is to you; since because one
   died for all men, therefore all were dead to Him; and He died for all,
   that we who live should not henceforth live to ourselves, but to Him
   who died for us, and rose again [4087] .' No longer then ought we to
   live to ourselves, but, as servants to the Lord. And not in vain should
   we receive the grace, as the time is especially an acceptable one
   [4088] , and the day of salvation hath dawned, even the death of our
   Redeemer [4089] . For even for our sakes the Word came down, and being
   incorruptible, put on a corruptible body for the salvation of all of
   us. Of which Paul was confident, saying, This corruptible must put on
   incorruption [4090] .' The Lord too was sacrificed, that by His blood
   He might abolish death. Full well did He once, in a certain place,
   blame those who participated vainly in the shedding of His blood, while
   they did not delight themselves in the flesh of the Word, saying, What
   profit is there in my blood, that I go down to corruption [4091] ?'
   This does not mean that the descent of the Lord was without profit, for
   it gained the whole world; but rather that after He had thus suffered,
   sinners would prefer to suffer loss than to profit by it. For He
   regarded our salvation as a delight and a peculiar gain; while on the
   contrary He looked upon our destruction as loss.

   5. Also in the Gospel, He praises those who increased the grace
   twofold, both him who made ten talents of five, and him who made four
   talents of two, as those who had profited, and turned them to good
   account; but him who hid the talent He cast out as wanting, saying to
   him, Thou wicked servant! oughtest thou not to have put My money to the
   exchangers? then at My coming I should have received Mine own with
   interest. Take, therefore, from him the talent, and give it to him that
   hath ten talents. For to every one that hath shall be given, and he
   shall have more abundantly; but from him that hath not, shall be taken
   away even that which he hath. And cast ye the unprofitable servant into
   outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth [4092] .'
   For it is not His will that the grace we have received should be
   unprofitable; but He requires us to take pains to render Him His own
   fruits, as the blessed Paul saith; The fruit of the Spirit is love,
   joy, and peace [4093] .' Having therefore this right resolution, and
   owing no man anything, but rather giving everything to every man, he
   was a teacher of the like rightness of principle, saying, Render to all
   their dues [4094] .' He was like those sent by the householder to
   receive the fruits of the vineyard from the husbandmen [4095] ; for he
   exhorted all men to render a return. But Israel despised and would not
   render, for their will was not right, nay moreover they killed those
   that were sent, and not even before the Lord of the vineyard were they
   ashamed, but even He was slain by them. Verily, when He came and found
   no fruit in them, He cursed them through the fig-tree, saying, Let
   there be henceforth no fruit from thee [4096] ;' and the fig-tree was
   dead and fruitless so that even the disciples wondered when it withered
   away.

   6. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by the prophet; I will take
   away from them the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of
   the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the scent of myrrh, and the
   light of a lamp, and the whole land shall be destroyed [4097] .' For
   the whole service of the law has been abolished from them, and
   henceforth and for ever they remain without a feast. And they observe
   not the Passover; for how can they? They have no abiding place, but
   they wander everywhere. And they eat unleavened bread contrary to the
   law, since they are unable first to sacrifice the lamb, as they were
   commanded to do when eating unleavened bread. But in every place they
   transgress the law, and as the judgments of God require, they keep days
   of grief instead of gladness. Now the cause of this to them was the
   slaying of the Lord, and that they did not reverence the Only-Begotten.
   At this time the altogether wicked heretics and ignorant schismatics
   are in the same case; the one in that they slay the Word, the other in
   that they rend the coat. They too remain expelled from the feast,
   because they live without godliness and knowledge, and emulate the
   conduct shewn in the matter of Bar-Abbas the robber, whom the Jews
   desired instead of the Saviour. Therefore the Lord cursed them under
   the figure of the fig-tree. Yet even thus He spared them in His
   loving-kindness, not destroying them root and all. For He did not curse
   the root, but [said], that no man should eat fruit of it thenceforth.
   When He did this, He abolished the shadow, causing it to wither; but
   preserved the root, so that we might [not] [4098] be grafted upon it;
   they too, if they abide not in unbelief, may attain to be grafted into
   their own olive tree [4099] .' Now when the Lord had cursed them
   because of their negligence, He removed from them the new moons, the
   true lamb, and that which is truly the Passover.

   7. But to us it came: there came too the solemn day, in which we ought
   to call to the feast with a trumpet [4100] , and separate ourselves to
   the Lord with thanksgiving, considering it as our own festival [4101] .
   For we are bound to celebrate it, not to ourselves but to the Lord; and
   to rejoice, not in ourselves but in the Lord, who bore our griefs and
   said, My soul is sorrowful unto death [4102] .' For the heathen, and
   all those who are strangers to our faith, keep feasts according to
   their own wills, and have no peace, since they commit evil against God.
   But the saints, as they live to the Lord also keep the feast to Him,
   saying, I will rejoice in Thy salvation,' and, my soul shall be joyful
   in the Lord.' The commandment is common to them, Rejoice, ye righteous,
   in the Lord [4103] '--so that they also may be gathered together, to
   sing that common and festal Psalm, Come, let us rejoice [4104] ,' not
   in ourselves, but, in the Lord.'

   8. For thus the patriarch Abraham rejoiced not to see his own day, but
   that of the Lord; and thus looking forward he saw it, and was glad
   [4105] .' And when he was tried, by faith he offered up Isaac, and
   sacrificed his only-begotten son--he who had received the promises.
   And, in offering his son, he worshipped the Son of God. And, being
   restrained from sacrificing Isaac, he saw the Messiah in the ram [4106]
   , which was offered up instead as a sacrifice to God. The patriarch was
   tried, through Isaac, not however that he was sacrificed, but He who
   was pointed out in Isaiah; He shall be led as a lamb to the slaughter,
   and as a sheep before her shearers he shall be speechless [4107] ;' but
   He took away the sin of the world. And on this account [Abraham] was
   restrained from laying his hand on the lad, lest the Jews, taking
   occasion from the sacrifice of Isaac, should reject the prophetic
   declarations concerning our Saviour, even all of them, but more
   especially those uttered by the Psalmist; Sacrifice and offering Thou
   wouldest not; a body Thou hast prepared Me [4108] ;' and should refer
   all such things as these to the son of Abraham.

   9. For the sacrifice was not properly the setting to rights [4109] of
   Isaac, but of Abraham who also offered, and by that was tried. Thus God
   accepted the will of the offerer, but prevented that which was offered
   from being sacrificed. For the death of Isaac did not procure freedom
   to the world, but that of our Saviour alone, by whose stripes we all
   are healed [4110] . For He raised up the falling, healed the sick,
   satisfied those who were hungry, and filled the poor, and, what is more
   wonderful, raised us all from the dead; having abolished death, He has
   brought us from affliction and sighing to the rest and gladness of this
   feast, a joy which reacheth even to heaven. For not we alone are
   affected by this, but because of it, even the heavens rejoice with us,
   and the whole church of the firstborn, written in heaven [4111] , is
   made glad together, as the prophet proclaims, saying, Rejoice, ye
   heavens, for the Lord hath had mercy upon Israel. Shout, ye foundations
   of the earth. Cry out with joy, ye mountains, ye high places, and all
   the trees which are in them, for the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and
   Israel hath been glorified [4112] .' And again; Rejoice, and be glad,
   ye heavens; let the hills melt into gladness, for the Lord hath had
   mercy on His people, and comforted the oppressed of the people [4113]
   .'

   10. The whole creation keeps a feast, my brethren, and everything that
   hath breath praises the Lord [4114] , as the Psalmist [says], on
   account of the destruction of the enemies, and our salvation. And
   justly indeed; for if there is joy in heaven over one sinner that
   repenteth [4115] , what should there not be over the abolition of sin,
   and the resurrection of the dead? Oh what a feast and how great the
   gladness in heaven! how must all its hosts joy and exult, as they
   rejoice and watch in our assemblies, those that are held continually,
   and especially those at Easter? For they look on sinners while they
   repent; on those who have turned away their faces, when they become
   converted; on those who formerly persisted in lusts and excess, but who
   now humble themselves by fastings and temperance; and, finally, on the
   enemy who lies weakened, lifeless, bound hand and foot, so that we may
   mock at him; Where is thy victory, O Death? where is thy sting, O Grave
   [4116] ?' Let us then sing unto the Lord a song of victory.

   11. Who then will lead us to such a company of angels as this? Who,
   coming with a desire for the heavenly feast, and the angelic holiday,
   will say like the prophet, I will pass to the place of the wondrous
   tabernacle, unto the house of God; with the voice of joy and praise,
   with the shouting of those who keep festival [4117] ?' To this course
   the saints also encourage us, saying, Come, let us go up to the
   mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob [4118] .'
   But not for the impure is this feast, nor is the ascent thereto for
   sinners; but it is for the virtuous and diligent; and for those who
   live according to the aim of the saints; for, Who shall ascend to the
   hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in His holy place, but he that
   hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not devoted his soul to
   vanity, nor sworn deceitfully to his neighbour. For he,' as the
   Psalmist adds, when he goes up, shall receive a blessing from the Lord
   [4119] .' Now this clearly also refers to what the Lord gives to them
   at the right hand, saying, Come, ye blessed, inherit the kingdom
   prepared for you [4120] .' But the deceitful, and he that is not pure
   of heart, and possesses nothing that is pure (as the Proverb saith, To
   a deceitful man there is nothing good [4121] '), shall assuredly, being
   a stranger, and of a different race from the saints, be accounted
   unworthy to eat the Passover, for a foreigner shall not eat of it
   [4122] .' Thus Judas, when he thought he kept the Passover, because he
   plotted deceit against the Saviour, was estranged from the city which
   is above, and from the apostolic company. For the law commanded the
   Passover to be eaten with due observance; but he, while eating it, was
   sifted of the devil [4123] , who had entered his soul.

   12. Wherefore let us not celebrate the feast after an earthly manner,
   but as keeping festival in heaven with the angels. Let us glorify the
   Lord, by chastity, by righteousness, and other virtues. And let us
   rejoice, not in ourselves, but in the Lord, that we may be inheritors
   with the saints. Let us keep the feast then, as Moses. Let us watch
   like David who rose seven times, and in the middle of the night gave
   thanks for the righteous judgments of God. Let us be early, as he said,
   In the morning I will stand before Thee, and Thou wilt look upon me: in
   the morning Thou wilt hear my voice [4124] .' Let us fast like Daniel;
   let us pray without ceasing, as Paul commanded; all of us recognising
   the season of prayer, but especially those who are honourably married;
   so that having borne witness to these things, and thus having kept the
   feast, we may be able to enter into the joy of Christ in the kingdom of
   heaven [4125] . But as Israel, when going up to Jerusalem, was first
   purified in the wilderness, being trained to forget the customs of
   Egypt, the Word by this typifying to us the holy fast of forty days,
   let us first be purified and freed from defilement [4126] , so that
   when we depart hence, having been careful of fasting, we may be able to
   ascend to the upper chamber [4127] with the Lord, to sup with Him; and
   may be partakers of the joy which is in heaven. In no other manner is
   it possible to go up to Jerusalem, and to eat the Passover, except by
   observing the fast of forty days.

   13. We begin the fast of forty days on the first day of the month
   Phamenoth (Feb. 25); and having prolonged it till the fifth of
   Pharmuthi (Mar. 31), suspending it upon the Sundays and the Saturdays
   [4128] preceding them, we then begin again on the holy days of Easter,
   on the sixth of Pharmuthi (Apr, 1), and cease on the eleventh of the
   same month (Apr. 6), late in the evening [4129] of the Saturday, whence
   dawns on us the holy Sunday, on the twelfth of Pharmuthi (Apr. 7),
   which extends its beams, with unobscured grace, to all the seven weeks
   of the holy Pentecost. Resting on that day, let us ever keep Easter joy
   in Christ Jesus our Lord, through Whom, to the Father, be glory and
   dominion for ever and ever. Amen. All the brethren who are with me
   salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.

   Here endeth the sixth Festal Letter of the holy and God-clad
   Athanasius.

   Letter VII.--For 335. Easter-day iv Pharmuthi, iii Kal. April; xx Moon;
   Ã†r. Dioclet. 51; Coss. Julius Constantius, the brother of Augustus,
   Rufinus Albinus; PrÃ¦fect, the same Philagrius; viii Indict.

   The blessed Paul [4130] wrote to the Corinthians [4131] that he always
   bore in his body the dying of Jesus, not as though he alone should make
   that boast, but also they and we too, and in this let us be followers
   of him, my brethren. And let this be the customary boast of all of us
   at all times. In this David participated, saying in the Psalms, For thy
   sake we die all the day; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter
   [4132] .' Now this is becoming in us, especially in the days of the
   feast, when a commemoration of the death of our Saviour is held. For he
   who is made like Him in His death, is also diligent in virtuous
   practices, having mortified his members which are upon the earth [4133]
   , and crucifying the flesh with the affections and lusts, he lives in
   the Spirit, and is conformed to the Spirit [4134] . He is always
   mindful of God, and forgets Him not, and never does the deeds of death.
   Now, in order that we may bear in our body the dying of Jesus, he
   immediately adds the way of such fellowship, saying, we having the same
   spirit of faith, as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I
   spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak [4135] .' He adds also,
   speaking of the grace that arises from knowledge; For He that raised up
   Jesus, will also raise us up with Jesus, and will present us before Him
   with you [4136] .'

   2. When by such faith and knowledge the saints have embraced this true
   life, they receive, doubtless, the joy which is in heaven; for which
   the wicked not caring, are deservedly deprived of the blessedness
   arising from it. For, let the wicked be taken away, so that he shall
   not see the glory of the Lord [4137] .' For although, when they shall
   hear the universal proclamation of the promise, Awake, thou that
   sleepest, and arise from the dead [4138] ,' they shall rise and shall
   come even to heaven, knocking and saying, Open to us [4139] ;'
   nevertheless the Lord will reprove them, as those who put the knowledge
   of Himself far from them, saying, I know you not.' But the holy Spirit
   cries against them, The wicked shall be turned into hell, even all the
   nations that forget God. [4140] .' Now we say that the wicked are dead,
   but not in an ascetic life opposed to sin; nor do they, like the
   saints, bear about dying in their bodies. But it is the soul which they
   bury in sins and follies, drawing near to the dead, and satisfying it
   with dead nourishment; like young eagles which, from high places, fly
   upon the carcases of the dead, and which the law prohibited, commanding
   figuratively, Thou shalt not eat the eagle, nor any other bird that
   feedeth on a dead carcase [4141] ;' and it pronounced unclean
   whatsoever eateth the dead. But these kill the soul with lusts, and say
   nothing but, let us eat and drink, for to morrow we die [4142] .' And
   the kind of fruit those have who thus love pleasures, he immediately
   describes, adding, And these things are revealed in the ears of the
   Lord of Hosts, that this sin shall not be forgiven you until ye die
   [4143] .' Yea, even while they live they shall be ashamed, because they
   consider their belly their lord; and when dead, they shall be
   tormented, because they have made a boast of such a death. To this
   effect also Paul bears witness, saying, Meats for the belly, and the
   belly for meats; but God shall destroy both it and them [4144] .' And
   the divine word declared before concerning them; The death of sinners
   is evil, and those who hate the righteous commit sin [4145] .' For
   bitter is the worm, and grievous the darkness, which wicked men
   inherit.

   3. But the saints, and they who truly practise virtue, mortify their
   members which are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness passions,
   evil concupiscence [4146] ;' and, as the result of this, are pure and
   without spot, confiding in the promise of our Saviour, who said,
   Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God [4147] .' These,
   having become dead to the world, and renounced the merchandise of the
   world, gain an honourable death; for, precious in the sight of the Lord
   is the death of His saints [4148] .' They are also able, preserving the
   Apostolic likeness, to say, I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I
   live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me [4149] .' For that is the true
   life, which a man lives in Christ; for although they are dead to the
   world, yet they dwell as it were in heaven, minding those things which
   are above, as he who was a lover of such a habitation said, While we
   walk on earth, our dwelling is in heaven [4150] .' Now those who thus
   live, and are partakers in such virtue, are alone able to give glory to
   God, and this it is which essentially constitutes a feast and a holiday
   [4151] . For the feast does not consist in pleasant intercourse at
   meals, nor splendour [4152] of clothing, nor days of leisure, but in
   the acknowledgment of God, and the offering of thanksgiving and of
   praise to Him [4153] . Now this belongs to the saints alone, who live
   in Christ; for it is written, The dead shall not praise Thee, O Lord,
   neither all those who go down into silence; but we who live will bless
   the Lord, from henceforth even for ever [4154] .' So was it with
   Hezekiah, who was delivered from death, and therefore praised God,
   saying, Those who are in hades cannot praise Thee; the dead cannot
   bless Thee; but the living shall bless Thee, as I also do [4155] .' For
   to praise and bless God belongs to those only who live in Christ, and
   by means of this they go up to the feast; for the Passover is not of
   the Gentiles, nor of those who are yet Jews in the flesh; but of those
   who acknowledge the truth in Christ [4156] , as he declares who was
   sent to proclaim such a feast; Our Passover, Christ, is sacrificed
   [4157] .'

   4. Therefore, although wicked men press forward to keep the feast, and
   as at a feast praise God, and intrude into the Church of the saints,
   yet God expostulates, saying to the sinner, Why dost thou talk of My
   ordinances?' And the gentle Spirit rebukes them, saying, Praise is not
   comely in the mouth of a sinner [4158] .' Neither hath sin any place in
   common with the praise of God; for the sinner has a mouth speaking
   perverse things, as the Proverb saith, The mouth of the wicked
   answereth evil things [4159] .' For how is it possible for us to praise
   God with an impure mouth? since things which are contrary to each other
   cannot coexist. For what communion has righteousness with iniquity? or,
   what fellowship is there between light and darkness? So exclaims Paul,
   a minister of the Gospel [4160] .

   Thus it is that sinners, and all those who are aliens from the Catholic
   Church, heretics, and schismatics, since they are excluded from
   glorifying (God) with the saints, cannot properly even continue
   observers of the feast. But the righteous man, although he appears
   dying to the world, uses boldness of speech, saying, I shall not die,
   but live, and narrate all Thy marvelous deeds [4161] .' For even God is
   not ashamed to be called the God [4162] of those who truly mortify
   their members which are upon the earth [4163] , but live in Christ; for
   He is the God of the living, not of the dead. And He by His living Word
   quickeneth all men, and gives Him to be food and life to the saints; as
   the Lord declares, I am the bread of life [4164] .' The Jews, because
   they were weak in perception, and had not exercised the senses of the
   soul in virtue, and did not comprehend this discourse about bread,
   murmured against Him, because He said, I am the bread which came down
   from heaven, and giveth life unto men [4165] .'

   5. For sin has her own special bread, of her death, and calling to
   those who are lovers of pleasure and lack understanding, she saith,
   Touch with delight secret bread, and sweet waters which are stolen
   [4166] ;' for he who merely touches them knows not that that which is
   born from the earth perishes with her. For even when the sinner thinks
   to find pleasure, the end of that food is not pleasant, as the Wisdom
   of God saith again, Bread of deceit is pleasant to a man; but
   afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel [4167] .' And, Honey
   droppeth from the lips of a whorish woman, which for a time is sweet to
   thy palate; but at the last thou shalt find it more bitter than gall,
   and sharper than a two-edged sword [4168] .' Thus then he eats and
   rejoices for a little time; afterwards he spurneth it when he hath
   removed his soul afar. For the fool knoweth not that those who depart
   far from God shall perish. And besides, there is the restraint of the
   prophetic admonition which says, What hast thou to do in the way of
   Egypt, to drink the waters of Gihon? And what hast thou to do in the
   way of Asshur, to drink the waters of the rivers [4169] ?' And the
   Wisdom of God which loves mankind forbids these things, crying, But
   depart quickly, tarry not in the place, neither fix thine eye upon it;
   for thus thou shalt pass over strange waters, and depart quickly from
   the strange river [4170] .' She also calls them to herself, For wisdom
   hath builded her house, and supported it on seven pillars; she hath
   killed her sacrifices, and mingled her wine in the goblets, and
   prepared her table; she hath sent forth her servants, inviting to the
   goblet with a loud proclamation, and saying, Whoso is foolish, let him
   turn in to me; and to them that lack understanding she saith, Come, eat
   of my bread, and drink of the wine I have mingled for you [4171] .' And
   what hope is there instead of these things? Forsake folly that ye may
   live, and seek understanding that ye may abide [4172] .' For the bread
   of Wisdom is living fruit, as the Lord said; I am the living bread
   which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall
   live for ever [4173] .' For when Israel ate of the manna, which was
   indeed pleasant and wonderful, yet he died, and he who ate it did not
   in consequence live for ever, but all that multitude died in the
   wilderness. The Lord teaches, saying, I am the bread of life: your
   fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the
   bread which came down from heaven, that a man should eat thereof, and
   not die [4174] .'

   6. Now wicked men hunger for bread like this, for effeminate souls will
   hunger; but the righteous alone, being prepared, shall be satisfied,
   saying, I shall behold Thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied
   when Thy glory is seen by me [4175] .' For he who partakes of divine
   bread always hungers with desire; and he who thus hungers has a
   never-failing gift, as Wisdom promises, saying, The Lord will not slay
   the righteous soul with famine.' He promises too in the Psalms, I will
   abundantly bless her provision; I will satisfy her poor with bread.' We
   may also hear our Saviour saying, Blessed are they who hunger and
   thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled [4176] .' Well
   then do the saints and those who love the life which is in Christ raise
   themselves to a longing after this food. And one earnestly implores,
   saying, As the hart panteth after the fountains of waters, so panteth
   my soul after Thee, O God! My soul thirsteth for the living God, when
   shall I come and see the face of God?' And another; My God, my God, I
   seek Thee early; my soul thirsteth for Thee; often does my flesh, in a
   dry and pathless land, and without water. So did I appear before Thee
   in holiness to see Thy power and Thy glory [4177] .'

   7. Since these things are so, my brethren, let us mortify our members
   which are on the earth [4178] , and be nourished with living bread, by
   faith and love to God, knowing that without faith it is impossible to
   be partakers of such bread as this. For our Saviour, when He called all
   men to him, and said, If any man thirst, let him [come] to Me and drink
   [4179] ,' immediately spoke of the faith without which a man cannot
   receive such food; He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture saith, out
   of his belly shall flow rivers of living water [4180] .' To this end He
   continually nourished His believing disciples with His words, and gave
   them life by the nearness of His divinity, but to the Canaanitish
   woman, because she was not yet a believer, He deigned not even a reply,
   although she stood greatly in need of food from Him. He did this not
   from scorn, far from it (for the Lord is loving to men and good, and on
   that account He went into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon); but because of
   her unbelief, and because she was of those who had not the word. And He
   did it righteously, my brethren; for there would have been nothing
   gained by her offering her supplication before believing, but by her
   faith she would support her petition; For He that cometh to God, must
   first believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that seek
   Him;' and that without faith it is impossible for a man to please Him
   [4181] .' This Paul teaches. Now that she was hitherto an unbeliever,
   one of the profane, He shews, saying, It is not meet to take the
   children's bread, and to cast it to dogs [4182] .' She then, being
   convinced by the power of the word, and having changed her ways, also
   gained faith; for the Lord no longer spoke to her as a dog, but
   conversed with her as a human being, saying, O woman, great is thy
   faith [4183] !' As therefore she believed, He forthwith granted to her
   the fruit of faith, and said, Be it to thee as thou desirest. And her
   daughter was healed in the self-same hour.'

   8. For the righteous man, being nurtured in faith and knowledge, and
   the observance of divine precepts, has his soul always in health.
   Wherefore it is commanded to receive to ourselves him who is weak in
   the faith [4184] ,' and to nourish him, even if he is not yet able to
   eat bread, but herbs, for he that is weak eateth herbs.' For even the
   Corinthians were not able to partake of such bread, being yet babes,
   and like babes they drank milk. For every one that partaketh of milk is
   unskilful in the word of righteousness [4185] ,' according to the words
   of that divine man. The Apostle exhorts his beloved son Timothy, in his
   first Epistle, to be nourished with the word of faith, and the good
   doctrine whereto he had attained.' And in the second, Preserve thou the
   form of sound words which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love
   which are in Christ Jesus [4186] .' And not only here, my brethren, is
   this bread the food of the righteous, neither are the saints on earth
   alone nourished by such bread and such blood; but we also eat them in
   heaven, for the Lord is the food even of the exalted spirits, and the
   angels, and He is the joy of all the heavenly host [4187] . And to all
   He is everything, and He has pity upon all according to His
   loving-kindness. Already hath the Lord given us angels' food [4188] ,
   and He promises to those who continue with Him in His trials, saying,
   And I promise to you a kingdom, as My Father hath promised to Me; that
   ye shall eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and sit on twelve
   thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel [4189] .' O what a banquet
   is this, my brethren, and how great is the harmony and gladness of
   those who eat at this heavenly table! For they delight themselves not
   with that food which is cast out, but with that which produces life
   everlasting. Who then shall be deemed worthy of that assembly? Who is
   so blessed as to be called, and accounted worthy of that divine feast?
   Truly, blessed is he who shall eat bread in Thy kingdom [4190] .'

   9. Now he who has been counted worthy of the heavenly calling, and by
   this calling has been sanctified, if he grow negligent in it, although
   washed becomes defiled: counting the blood of the covenant by which he
   was sanctified a profane thing, and despising the Spirit of grace,' he
   hears the words, Friend, how camest thou in hither, not having wedding
   garments?' For the banquet of the saints is spotless and pure; for many
   are called, but few chosen [4191] .' Judas to wit, though he came to
   the supper, because he despised it went out from the presence of the
   Lord, and having abandoned his Life [4192] , hanged himself. But the
   disciples who continued with the Redeemer shared in the happiness of
   the feast. And that young man who went into a far country, and there
   wasted his substance, living in dissipation, if he receive a desire for
   this divine feast, and, coming to himself, shall say, How many hired
   servants of my father have bread to spare, while I perish here with
   hunger!' and shall next arise and come to his father, and confess to
   him, saying, I have sinned against heaven and before thee, and am not
   worthy to be called thy son; make me as one of thy hired servants
   [4193] ;'--when he shall thus confess, then he shall be counted worthy
   of more than he prayed for. For the father does not receive him as a
   hired servant, neither does he look upon him as a stranger, but he
   kisses him as a son, he brings him back to life as from the dead, and
   counts him worthy of the divine feast, and gives him his former and
   precious robe. So that, on this account, there is singing and gladness
   in the paternal home.

   10. For this is the work of the Father's loving-kindness and goodness,
   that not only should He make him alive from the dead, but that He
   should render His grace illustrious through the Spirit. Therefore,
   instead of corruption, He clothes him with an incorruptible garment;
   instead of hunger, He kills the fatted calf; instead of far journeys,
   [the Father] watched for his return, providing shoes for his feet; and,
   what is most wonderful, placed a divine signet-ring upon his hand;
   whilst by all these things He begot him afresh in the image of the
   glory of Christ. These are the gracious gifts of the Father, by which
   the Lord honours and nourishes those who abide with Him, and also those
   who return to Him and repent. For He promises, saying, I am the bread
   of life; he that cometh unto Me shall not hunger, and he that believeth
   on Me shall never thirst [4194] .' We too shall be counted worthy of
   these things, if at all times we cleave to our Saviour, and if we are
   pure, not only in these six days of Easter [4195] , but consider the
   whole course of our life as a feast [4196] , and continue near and do
   not go far off, saying to Him, Thou hast the words of eternal life, and
   whither shall we go [4197] ?' Let those of us who are far off return,
   confessing our iniquities, and having nothing against any man, but by
   the spirit mortifying the deeds of the body [4198] . For thus, having
   first nourished the soul here, we shall partake with angels at that
   heavenly and spiritual table; not knocking and being repulsed like
   those five foolish virgins [4199] , but entering with the Lord, like
   those who were wise and loved the bridegroom; and shewing the dying of
   Jesus in our bodies [4200] , we shall receive life and the kingdom from
   Him.

   11. We begin the fast of forty days on the twenty-third of Mechir (Feb.
   17), and the holy fast of the blessed feast on the twenty-eighth of
   Phamenoth (Mar. 24); and having joined to these six days after them, in
   fastings and watchings, as each one is able, let us rest on the third
   of the month Pharmuthi (Mar. 29), on the evening of the seventh day.
   Also that day which is holy and blessed in everything, which possesses
   the name of Christ, namely the Lord's day [4201] , having risen upon us
   on the fourth of Pharmuthi (Mar. 30), let us afterwards keep the holy
   feast of Pentecost. Let us at all times worship the Father in Christ,
   through Whom to Him and with Him be glory and dominion by the Holy
   Ghost for ever and ever. Amen. All the brethren who are with me salute
   you: salute one another with a holy kiss.

   There is no eighth or ninth, for he did not send them, for the reason
   before mentioned [4202] .

   Letter X.--For 338. Coss. Ursus and Polemius; PrÃ¦f. the same Theodorus,
   of Heliopolis, and of the Catholics [4203] . After him, for the second
   year, Philagrius; Indict. xi; Easter-day, vii Kal. Ap. [4204] xxx
   Phamenoth; Moon 18Â½; Ã†ra Dioclet. 54.

   [4205] Although I have travelled all this distance from you, my
   brethren, I have not forgotten the custom which obtains among you,
   which has been delivered to us by the fathers [4206] , so as to be
   silent without notifying to you the time of the annual holy feast, and
   the day for its celebration. For although I have been hindered by those
   afflictions of which you have doubtless heard, and severe trials have
   been laid upon me, and a great distance has separated us; while the
   enemies of the truth have followed our tracks, laying snares to
   discover a letter from us, so that by their accusations, they might add
   to the pain of our wounds; yet the Lord, strengthening and comforting
   us in our afflictions, we have not feared, even when held fast in the
   midst of such machinations and conspiracies, to indicate and make known
   to you our saving Easter-feast, even from the ends of the earth. Also
   when I wrote to the presbyters of Alexandria, I urged that these
   letters might be sent to you through their instrumentality, although I
   knew the fear imposed on them by the adversaries. Still, I exhorted
   them to be mindful of the apostolic boldness of speech, and to say,
   Nothing separates us from the love of Christ; neither affliction, nor
   distress, nor persecution, nor famine, nor nakedness, nor peril, nor
   sword [4207] .' Thus, keeping the feast myself, I was desirous that you
   also, my beloved, should keep it; and being conscious that an
   announcement like this is due from me, I have not delayed to discharge
   this duty, fearing to be condemned by the Apostolic counsel; Render to
   every man his due [4208] .'

   2. While I then committed all my affairs to God, I was anxious to
   celebrate the feast with you, not taking into account the distance
   between us. For although place separate us, yet the Lord the Giver of
   the feast, and Who is Himself our feast [4209] , Who is also the
   Bestower of the Spirit [4210] , brings us together in mind, in harmony,
   and in the bond of peace [4211] . For when we mind and think the same
   things, and offer up the same prayers on behalf of each other, no place
   can separate us, but the Lord gathers and unites us together. For if He
   promises, that when two or three are gathered together in His name, He
   is in the midst of them [4212] ,' it is plain that being in the midst
   of those who in every place are gathered together, He unites them, and
   receives the prayers of all of them, as if they were near, and listens
   to all of them, as they cry out the same Amen [4213] . I have [4214]
   borne affliction like this, and all those trials which I mentioned, my
   brethren, when I wrote to you.

   3. And that we may not distress you at all, I would now (only) briefly
   remind you of these things, because it is not becoming in a man to
   forget, when more at ease, the pains he experienced in tribulation;
   lest, like an unthankful and forgetful person, he should be excluded
   from the divine assembly. For at no time should a man freely praise
   God, more than when he has passed through afflictions; nor, again,
   should he at any time give thanks more than when he finds rest from
   toil and temptations. As Hezekiah, when the Assyrians perished, praised
   the Lord, and, gave thanks, saying, The Lord is my salvation [4215] ;
   and I will not cease to bless Thee with harp all the days of my life,
   before the house of the Lord [4216] .' And those valiant and blessed
   three who were tried in Babylon, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, when
   they were in safety and the fire became to them as dew, gave thanks,
   praising and saying words of glory to God [4217] .' I too like them
   have written, my brethren, having these things in mind; for even in our
   time, God hath made possible those things which are impossible to men.
   And those things which could not be accomplished by man, the Lord has
   shewn to be easy of accomplishment, by bringing us to you. For He does
   not give us as a prey to those who seek to swallow us up. For it is not
   so much us, as the Church, and the faith and godliness which they
   planned to overwhelm with wickedness.

   4. But God, who is good, multiplied His loving-kindness towards us, not
   only when He granted the common salvation of us all through His Word,
   but now also, when enemies have persecuted us, and have sought to seize
   upon us. As the blessed Paul saith in a certain place, when describing
   the incomprehensible riches of Christ: But God, being rich in mercy,
   for the great love wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in
   follies and sins, quickened us with Christ [4218] .' For the might of
   man and of all creatures, is weak and poor; but the Might which is
   above man, and uncreated, is rich and incomprehensible, and has no
   beginning, but is eternal. He does not then possess one method only of
   healing, but being rich, He works in divers manners for our salvation
   by means of His Word, Who is not restricted or hindered in His dealings
   towards us; but since He is rich and manifold, He varies Himself
   according to the individual capacity of each soul. For He is the Word
   and the Power and the Wisdom of God, as Solomon testifies concerning
   Wisdom, that being one, it can do all things, and remaining in itself,
   it maketh all things new; and passing upon holy souls, fashioneth the
   friends of God and the prophets [4219] .' To those then who have not
   yet attained to the perfect way He becomes like a sheep giving milk,
   and this was administered by Paul: I have fed you with milk, not with
   meat [4220] .' To those who have advanced beyond the full stature of
   childhood, but still are weak as regards perfection, He is their food,
   according to their capacity, being again administered by Paul [4221] ,
   Let him that is weak eat herbs.' But as soon as ever a man begins to
   walk in the perfect way, he is no longer fed with the things before
   mentioned, but he has the Word for bread, and flesh for food, for it is
   written, Strong meat is for those who are of full age, for those who,
   by reason of their capacity, have their senses exercised [4222] .' And
   further, when the word is sown it does not yield a uniform produce of
   fruit in this human life, but one various and rich; for it bringeth
   forth, some an hundred, and some sixty, and some thirty [4223] , as the
   Saviour teaches--that Sower of grace, and Bestower of the Spirit [4224]
   . And this is no doubtful matter, nor one that admits no confirmation;
   but it is in our power to behold the field which is sown by Him; for in
   the Church the word is manifold and the produce [4225] rich. Not with
   virgins alone is such a field adorned; nor with monks alone, but also
   with honourable matrimony and the chastity of each one. For in sowing,
   He did not compel the will beyond the power. Nor is mercy confined to
   the perfect, but it is sent down also among those who occupy the middle
   and the third ranks, so that He might rescue all men generally to
   salvation. To this intent He hath prepared many mansions [4226] with
   the Father, so that although the dwelling-place is various in
   proportion to the advance in moral attainment, yet all of us are within
   the wall, and all of us enter within the same fence, the adversary
   being cast out, and all his host expelled thence. For apart from light
   there is darkness, and apart from blessing there is a curse, the devil
   also is apart from the saints, and sin far from virtue. Therefore the
   Gospel rebukes Satan, saying, Get thee behind Me, Satan [4227] .' But
   us it calls to itself, saying, Enter ye in at the strait gate.' And
   again, Come, blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom which is
   prepared for you [4228] .' So also the Spirit cried aforetime in the
   Psalms, saying, Enter into His gates with psalms [4229] .' For through
   virtue a man enters in unto God, as Moses did into the thick cloud
   where God was. But through vice a man goes out from the presence of the
   Lord; as Cain [4230] when he had slain his brother, went out, as far as
   his will was concerned, from before the face of God; and the Psalmist
   enters, saying, And I will go in to the altar of God, even to the God
   that delighteth my youth [4231] .' But of the devil the Scripture
   beareth witness, that the devil went out from before God, and smote Job
   [4232] with sore boils. For this is the characteristic of those who go
   out from before God--to smite and to injure the men of God. And this is
   the characteristic of those who fall away from the faith--to injure and
   persecute the faithful. The saints on the other hand, take such to
   themselves and look upon them as friends; as also the blessed David,
   using openness of speech, says, Mine eyes are on the faithful of the
   earth, that they may dwell with me.' But those that are weak in the
   faith [4233] , Paul urges that we should especially take to ourselves.
   For virtue is philanthropic [4234] , just as in men of an opposite
   character, sin is misanthropic. So Saul, being a sinner, persecuted
   David, whereas David, though he had a good opportunity, did not kill
   Saul. Esau too persecuted Jacob, while Jacob overcame his wickedness by
   meekness. And those eleven sold Joseph, but Joseph, in his
   loving-kindness, had pity on them.

   5. But what need we many words? Our Lord and Saviour, when He was
   persecuted by the Pharisees, wept for their destruction. He was
   injured, but He threatened [4235] not; not when He was afflicted, not
   even when He was killed. But He grieved for those who dared to do such
   things. He, the Saviour, suffered for man, but they despised and cast
   from them life, and light, and grace. All these were theirs through
   that Saviour Who suffered in our stead. And verily for their darkness
   and blindness, He wept. For if they had understood the things which are
   written in the Psalms, they would not have been so vainly daring
   against the Saviour, the Spirit having said, Why do the heathen rage,
   and the people imagine a vain thing?' And if they had considered the
   prophecy of Moses, they would not have hanged Him Who was their Life
   [4236] . And if they had examined with their understanding the things
   which were written, they would not have carefully fulfilled the
   prophecies which were against themselves, so as for their city to be
   now desolate, grace taken from them, and they themselves without the
   law, being no longer called children, but strangers. For thus in the
   Psalms was it before declared, saying, The strange children have acted
   falsely by Me.' And by Isaiah the prophet; I have begotten and brought
   up children, and they have rejected Me. [4237] ' And they are no longer
   named the people of God, and a holy nation, but rulers of Sodom, and
   people of Gomorrah; having exceeded in this even the iniquity of the
   Sodomites, as the prophet also saith, Sodom is justified before thee
   [4238] .' For the Sodomites raved against angels, but these against the
   Lord and God and King of all, and these dared to slay the Lord of
   angels, not knowing that Christ, who was slain by them, liveth. But
   those Jews who had conspired against the Lord died, having rejoiced a
   very little in these temporal things, and having fallen away from those
   which are eternal. They were ignorant of this--that the immortal
   promise has not respect to temporal enjoyment, but to the hope of those
   things which are everlasting. For through many tribulations, and
   labours, and sorrows, the saint enters into the kingdom of heaven; but
   when he arrives where sorrow, and distress, and sighing, shall flee
   away, he shall thenceforward enjoy rest; as Job, who, when tried here,
   was afterwards the familiar friend of the Lord. But the lover of
   pleasures, rejoicing for a little while, afterwards passes a sorrowful
   life; like Esau, who had temporal food, but afterwards was condemned
   thereby.

   6. We may take as a type of this distinction, the departure of the
   children of Israel and the Egyptians from Egypt. For the Egyptians,
   rejoicing a little while in their injustice against Israel, when they
   went forth, were all drowned in the deep; but the people of God, being
   for a time smitten and injured, by the conduct of the taskmasters, when
   they came out of Egypt, passed through the sea unharmed, and walked in
   the wilderness as an inhabited place. For although the place was
   unfrequented by man and desolate, yet, through the gracious gift of the
   law, and through converse with angels, it was no longer desert, but far
   more than an inhabited country. As also Elisha [4239] , when he thought
   he was alone in the wilderness, was with companies of angels; so in
   this case, though the people were at first afflicted and in the
   wilderness, yet those who remained faithful afterwards entered the land
   of promise. In like manner those who suffer temporal afflictions here,
   finally having endured, attain comfort, while those who here persecute
   are trodden under foot, and have no good end. For even the rich man
   [4240] , as the Gospel affirms, having indulged in pleasure here for a
   little while, suffered hunger there, and having drunk largely here, he
   there thirsted exceedingly. But Lazarus, after being afflicted in
   worldly things, found rest in heaven, and having hungered for bread
   ground from corn, he was there satisfied with that which is better than
   manna, even the Lord who came down and said, I am the bread which came
   down from heaven, and giveth life to mankind [4241] .'

   7. Oh! my dearly beloved, if we shall gain comfort from afflictions, if
   rest from labours, if health after sickness, if from death immortality,
   it is not right to be distressed by the temporal ills that lay hold on
   mankind. It does not become us to be agitated because of the trials
   which befall us. It is not right to fear if the gang that contended
   with Christ, should conspire against godliness; but we should the more
   please God through these things, and should consider such matters as
   the probation and exercise of a virtuous life. For how shall patience
   be looked for, if there be not previously labours and sorrows? Or how
   can fortitude be tested with no assault from enemies? Or how shall
   magnanimity be exhibited, unless after contumely and injustice? Or how
   can long-suffering be proved, unless there has first been the calumny
   of Antichrist [4242] ? And, finally, how can a man behold virtue with
   his eyes, unless the iniquity of the very wicked has previously
   appeared? Thus even our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ comes before us,
   when He would shew men how to suffer, Who when He was smitten bore it
   patiently, being reviled He reviled not again, when He suffered He
   threatened not, but He gave His back to the smiters, and His cheeks to
   buffetings, and turned not His face from spitting [4243] ; and at last,
   was willingly led to death, that we might behold in Him the image of
   all that is virtuous and immortal, and that we, conducting ourselves
   after these examples, might truly tread on serpents and scorpions, and
   on all the power of the enemy [4244] .

   8. Thus too Paul, while he conducted himself after the example of the
   Lord, exhorted us, saying, Be ye followers of me, as I also am of
   Christ [4245] .' In this way he prevailed against all the divisions of
   the devil, writing, I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor
   angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor
   powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to
   separate us from the love of God which is in Jesus Christ [4246] .' For
   the enemy draws near to us in afflictions, and trials, and labours,
   using every endeavour to ruin us. But the man who is in Christ,
   combating those things that are contrary, and opposing wrath by
   long-suffering, contumely by meekness, and vice by virtue, obtains the
   victory, and exclaims, I can do all things through Christ Who
   strengtheneth me;' and, In all these things we are conquerors through
   Christ Who loved us [4247] .' This is the grace of the Lord, and these
   are the Lord's means of restoration for the children of men. For He
   suffered to prepare freedom from suffering for those who suffer in Him,
   He descended that He might raise us up, He took on Him the trial of
   being born, that we might love Him Who is unbegotten, He went down to
   corruption, that corruption might put on immortality, He became weak
   for us, that we might rise with power, He descended to death, that He
   might bestow on us immortality, and give life to the dead. Finally, He
   became man, that we who die as men might live again, and that death
   should no more reign over us; for the Apostolic word proclaims, Death
   shall not have the dominion over us [4248] .'

   9. Now because they did not thus consider these matters, the
   Ario-maniacs [4249] , being opponents of Christ, and heretics, smite
   Him who is their Helper with their tongue, and blaspheme Him who set
   [them] free, and hold all manner of different opinions against the
   Saviour. Because of His coming down, which was on behalf of man, they
   have denied His essential Godhead; and seeing that He came forth from
   the Virgin, they doubt His being truly the Son of God, and considering
   Him as become incarnate in time, they deny His eternity; and, looking
   upon Him as having suffered for us, they do not believe in Him as the
   incorruptible Son from the incorruptible Father. And finally, because
   He endured for our sakes, they deny the things which concern His
   essential eternity; allowing the deed of the unthankful, these despise
   the Saviour, and offer Him insult instead of acknowledging His grace.
   To them may these words justly be addressed: Oh! unthankful opponent of
   Christ, altogether wicked, and the slayer of his Lord, mentally blind,
   and a Jew in his mind, hadst thou understood the Scriptures, and
   listened to the saints, who said, Cause Thy face to shine, and we shall
   be saved;' or again, Send out Thy light and Thy truth [4250] ;'--then
   wouldest thou have known that the Lord did not descend for His own
   sake, but for ours; and for this reason, thou wouldest the more have
   admired His loving kindness. And hadst thou considered what the Father
   is, and what the Son, thou wouldest not have blasphemed the Son, as of
   a mutable nature [4251] . And hadst thou understood His work of
   loving-kindness towards us, thou wouldest not have alienated the Son
   from the Father, nor have looked upon Him as a stranger [4252] , Who
   reconciled us to His Father. I know these [words] are grievous, not
   only to those who dispute with Christ [4253] , but also to the
   schismatics; for they are united together, as men of kindred feelings.
   For they have learned to rend the seamless coat [4254] of God: they
   think it not strange to divide the indivisible Son from the Father
   [4255] .

   10. I know indeed, that when these things are spoken, they will gnash
   their teeth upon us, with the devil who stirs them up, since they are
   troubled by the declaration of the true glory concerning the Redeemer.
   But the Lord, Who always has scoffed at the devil, does the same even
   now, saying, I am in the Father, and the Father in Me [4256] .' This is
   the Lord, Who is manifested in the Father, and in Whom also the Father
   is manifested; Who, being truly the Son of the Father, at last became
   incarnate for our sakes, that He might offer Himself to the Father in
   our stead, and redeem us through His oblation and sacrifice. This is He
   Who once brought the people of old time out of Egypt; but Who
   afterwards redeemed all of us, or rather the whole race of men, from
   death, and brought them up from the grave. This is He Who in old time
   was sacrificed as a lamb, He being signified in the lamb; but Who
   afterwards was slain for us, for Christ our Passover is sacrificed
   [4257] .' This is He Who delivered us from the snare of the hunters,
   from the opponents of Christ, I say, and from the schismatics, and
   again rescued us His Church. And because we were then victims of
   deceit, He has now delivered us by His own self.

   11. What then is our duty, my brethren, for the sake of these things,
   but to praise and give thanks to God, the King of all? And let us first
   exclaim in the words of the Psalms, Blessed be the Lord, Who hath not
   given us over as a prey to their teeth [4258] .' Let us keep the feast
   in that way which He hath dedicated for us unto salvation--the holy day
   Easter--so that we may celebrate the feast which is in heaven with the
   angels. Thus anciently, the people of the Jews, when they came out of
   affliction into a state of ease, kept the feast, staging a song of
   praise for their victory. So also the people in the time of Esther,
   because they were delivered from the edict of death, kept a feast to
   the Lord [4259] , reckoning it a feast, returning thanks to the Lord,
   and praising Him for having changed their condition. Therefore let us,
   performing our vows to the Lord, and confessing our sins, keep the
   feast to the Lord, in conversation, moral conduct, and manner of life;
   praising our Lord, Who hath chastened us a little, but hath not utterly
   failed nor forsaken us, nor altogether kept silence from us. For if,
   having brought us out of the deceitful and famous Egypt of the
   opponents of Christ, He hath caused us to pass through many trials and
   afflictions, as it were in the wilderness, to His holy Church, so that
   from hence, according to custom, we can send to you, as well as receive
   letters from you; on this account especially I both give thanks to God
   myself, and exhort you to thank Him with me and on my behalf, this
   being the Apostolic custom, which these opponents of Christ, and the
   schismatics, wished to put an end to, and to break off. The Lord did
   not permit it, but both renewed and preserved that which was ordained
   by Him through the Apostle, so that we may keep the feast together, and
   together keep holy-day, according to the tradition and commandment of
   the fathers.

   12. We begin the fast of forty days on the nineteenth of the month
   Mechir (Feb. 13); and the holy Easter-fast on the twenty-fourth of the
   month Phamenoth (Mar. 20). We cease from the fast on the twenty-ninth
   of the month Phamenoth (Mar. 25), late in the evening of the seventh
   day. And we thus keep the feast on the first day of the week which
   dawns on the thirtieth of the month Phamenoth (Mar. 26); from which, to
   Pentecost, we keep holy-day, through seven weeks, one after the other.
   For when we have first meditated properly on these things, we shall
   attain to be counted worthy of those which are eternal, through Christ
   Jesus our Lord, through Whom to the Father be glory and dominion for
   ever and ever. Amen. Greet one another with a holy kiss, remembering us
   in your holy prayers. All the brethren who are with me salute you, at
   all times remembering you. And I pray that ye may have health in the
   Lord, my beloved brethren, whom we love above all.

   Here endeth the tenth Letter of holy Athanasius.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [4203] The text is difficult; possibly the Syriac translator is
   responsible for the difficulty. But we know from Ath. (supr. p. 273)
   that the reappointment of Philagrius was in the express interest of the
   Arians: it is, therefore, probable that Theodorus was not unfavourable
   to Athanasius. See Prolegg. ch. ii. Â§6 (1), and Sievers, pp. 101, 102.

   [4204] In the Chron. Pasch. tom. ii. p. 202, Easter-day is wrongly
   given as falling on viii. Kal. Ap.

   [4205] See Prolegg. ch. v. Â§3 b. The letter may have been finished (see
   Â§Â§3, 11) after Ath. had returned home, but the language of Â§1 seems to
   be applicable only to his residence at Treveri, and Â§11 may be
   reconciled to this supposition. In this case (Â§1 sub. fin.) it was
   probably begun as early as the Easter of 337; cf. Letters 17 and 18.

   [4214] Thus far Athan. has been referring to the circumstances
   attending his exile for the last two years. The principal subject of
   the remaining part consists of the duty incumbent on us to praise and
   thank God for deliverance from affliction, and to exercise forgiveness
   towards our enemies. He several times (e.g. Â§Â§3, 10) speaks of his
   restoration to the Church of Alexandria.

   Letter XI.--For 339. Coss. Constantius Augustus II, Constans I;
   PrÃ¦fect, Philagrius the Cappadocian, for the second time; Indict. xii;
   Easter-day xvii Kal. Mai, xx Pharmuthi; Ã†ra Dioclet. 55.

   The blessed Paul, being girt about with every virtue [4260] , and
   called faithful of the Lord--for he was conscious of nothing in himself
   but what was a virtue and a praise [4261] , or what was in harmony with
   love and godliness--clave to these things more and more, and was
   carried up even to heavenly places, and was borne to Paradise [4262] ;
   to the end that, as he surpassed the conversation of men, he should be
   exalted above men. And when he descended, he preached to every man; We
   know in part, and we prophesy in part; here I know in part; but then
   shall I know even as also I am known [4263] .' For, in truth, he was
   known to those saints who are in heaven, as their fellow-citizen [4264]
   . And in relation to all that is future and perfect, the things known
   by him here were in part; but with respect to those things which were
   committed and entrusted to him by the Lord, he was perfect; as he said,
   We who are perfect, should be thus minded [4265] .' For as the Gospel
   of Christ is the fulfilment and accomplishment of the ministration
   which was supplied by the law of Israel, so future things will be the
   accomplishment of such as now exist, the Gospel being then fulfilled,
   and the faithful receiving those things which, not seeing now, they yet
   hope for, as Paul saith; For what a man seeth, why doth he also hope
   for? But if we hope for those things we see [not], we then by patience
   wait for them [4266] .' Since then that blessed man was of such a
   character, and apostolic grace was committed to him, he wrote, wishing
   that all men should be as he was [4267] .' For virtue is philanthropic
   [4268] , and great is the company of the kingdom of heaven, for
   thousands of thousands and myriads of myriads there serve the Lord. And
   though a man enters it through a strait and narrow way, yet having
   entered, he beholds immeasurable space, and a place greater than any
   other, as they declare, who were eye-witnesses and heirs of these
   things. Thou didst place afflictions before us.' But afterwards, having
   related their afflictions, they say, Thou broughtest us forth into a
   wide place;' and again, In affliction Thou hast enlarged us [4269] .'
   For truly, my brethren, the course of the saints here is straitened;
   since they either toil painfully through longing for those things which
   are to come, as he who said, Woe is me that my pilgrimage is prolonged
   [4270] ;' or they are distressed and spent for the salvation of other
   men, as Paul wrote to the Corinthians, saying, Lest, when I come to
   you, God should humble me, and I should bewail many of those who have
   sinned already, and not repented for the uncleanness and fornication
   and lasciviousness which they have committed [4271] .' As Samuel
   bewailed the destruction of Saul, and Jeremiah wept for the captivity
   of the people. But after this affliction, and sorrow, and sighing, when
   they depart from this world, a certain divine gladness, and pleasure,
   and exultation receives them, from which misery and sorrow, and
   sighing, flee away.

   2. Since we are thus circumstanced, my brethren, let us never loiter in
   the path of virtue; for hereto he counsels us, saying, Be ye followers
   of me, as I also am of Christ [4272] .' For he gave this advice not to
   the Corinthians only, since he was not their Apostle only, but being a
   teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity [4273] ,' he admonished us
   all through them; and in short, the things he wrote to each particular
   person are commandments common to all men [4274] . On this account in
   writing to different people, some he exhorted as, for instance, in the
   Epistles to the Romans, and the Ephesians, and Philemon. Some he
   reproved, and was indignant with them, as in the case of the
   Corinthians and Galatians. To some he gave advice, as to the Colossians
   and Thessalonians. The Philippians he approved of, and rejoiced in
   them. The Hebrews he taught that the law was a shadow to them [4275] .
   But to his elect sons, Timothy and Titus, when they were near, he gave
   instruction; when far away, he put them in remembrance. For he was all
   things to all men; and being himself a perfect man, he adapted his
   teaching to the need of every one, so that by all means he might rescue
   some of them. Therefore his word was not without fruit; but in every
   place it is planted and productive even to this day.

   3. And wherefore, my beloved? For it is right that we should search
   into the apostolic mind. Not only in the beginning of the Epistles, but
   towards their close, and in the middle of them, he used persuasions and
   admonitions. I hope therefore that, by your prayers, I shall in no
   respect falsely represent the plan of that holy man. As he was well
   skilled in these divine matters, and knew the power of the divine
   teaching, he deemed it necessary, in the first place, to make known the
   word concerning Christ, and the mystery regarding Him; and then
   afterwards to point to the correction of habits, so that when they had
   learned to know the Lord, they might earnestly desire to do those
   things which He commanded. For when the Guide to the laws is unknown,
   one does not readily pass on to the observance of them. Faithful Moses,
   the minister of God, adopted this method; for when he promulgated the
   words of the divine dispensation of laws, he first proclaimed the
   matters relating to the knowledge of God: Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy
   God is one Lord [4276] .' Afterwards, having shadowed Him forth to the
   people, and taught of Him in Whom they ought to believe, and informed
   their minds of Him Who is truly God, he proceeds to lay down the law
   relating to those things whereby a man may be well-pleasing to Him,
   saying, Thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt not steal;' together
   with the other commandments. For also, according to the Apostolic
   teaching, He that draweth near to God must believe that He is, and that
   He is a rewarder of them that seek Him [4277] .' Now He is sought by
   means of virtuous deeds, as the prophet saith; Seek ye the Lord, and
   when ye have found Him, call upon Him; when He is near to you, let the
   wicked forsake his ways, and the lawless man his thoughts [4278] .'

   4. It will also be well if a man is not offended at the testimony of
   the Shepherd, saying in the beginning of his book, Before all things
   believe that there is one God, Who created and established all these
   things, and from non-existence called them into being [4279] .' And,
   further, the blessed Evangelists--who recorded the words of the
   Lord--in the beginning of the Gospels, wrote the things concerning our
   Saviour; so that, having first made known the Lord, the Creator, they
   might be believed when narrating the events that took place. For how
   could they have been believed, when writing respecting him who [was
   blind] from his mother's womb, and those other blind men who recovered
   their sight, and those who rose from the dead, and the changing of
   water into wine, and those lepers who were cleansed; if they had not
   taught of Him as the Creator, writing, In the beginning was the Word
   [4280] ?' Or, according to Matthew, that He Who was born of the seed of
   David, was Emmanuel, and the Son of the living God? He from Whom the
   Jews, with the Arians, turn away their faces, but Whom we acknowledge
   and worship. The Apostle therefore, as was meet, sent to different
   people, but his own son he especially reminded, that he should not
   despise the things in which he had been instructed by him,' and
   enjoined on him, Remember Jesus Christ, who rose from the dead, of the
   seed of David, according to my Gospel [4281] .' And speaking of these
   things being delivered to him, to be always had in remembrance, he
   immediately writes to him, saying, Meditate on these things: be engaged
   in them. [4282] ' For constant meditation, and the remembrance of
   divine words, strengthens piety towards God, and produces a love to Him
   inseparable and not merely formal [4283] ; as he, being of this mind,
   speaks about himself and others like-minded, saying boldly, Who shall
   separate us from the love of God [4284] ?' For [4285] such men, being
   confirmed in the Lord, and possessing an unshaken disposition towards
   Him, and being one in spirit (for [4286] he who is joined to the Spirit
   is one spirit'), are sure as the mount Sion;' and although ten thousand
   trials may rage against them, they are founded upon a rock, which is
   Christ [4287] . In Him the careless take no delight; and having no
   continuous purpose of good, they are sullied by temporal attacks, and
   esteem nothing more highly than present things, being unstable and
   deserving reproof as regards the faith. For either the care of this
   world, or the deceitfulness of riches, chokes them [4288] ;' or, as
   Jesus said in that parable which had reference to them, since they have
   not established the faith that has been preached to them, but continue
   only for a time, immediately, in time of persecution, or when
   affliction ariseth through the word, they are offended. Now those who
   meditate evil we say, [think] not truth, but falsehood and not
   righteousness, but iniquity, for their tongue learns to speak lies.
   They have done evil, and have not ceased that they might repent. For,
   persevering with delight in wicked actions, they hasten thereto without
   turning back, even treading under foot the commandment with regard to
   neighbours, and, instead of loving them, devise evil against them, as
   the saint testifies, saying, And those who seek me evil have spoken
   vanity, and imagined deceit all the day [4289] .' But that the cause of
   such meditation is none other than the want of instruction, the divine
   proverb has already declared; The son that forsaketh the commandment of
   his father meditateth evil words [4290] .' But such meditation, because
   it is evil, the Holy Spirit blames in these words, and reproves too in
   other terms, saying, Your hands are polluted with blood, your fingers
   with sins; your lips have spoken lawlessness, and your tongue imagineth
   iniquity: no man speaketh right things, nor is there true judgment
   [4291] .' But what the end is of such perverse imagining, He
   immediately declares, saying, They trust in vanities and speak
   falsehood; for they conceive mischief, and bring forth lawlessness.
   They have hatched the eggs of an asp, and woven a spider's web; and he
   who is prepared to eat of their eggs, when he breaks them finds gall,
   and a basilisk therein [4292] .' Again, what the hope of such is, He
   has already announced. Because righteousness does not overtake them,
   when they waited for light, they had darkness; when they waited for
   brightness, they walked in a thick cloud. They shall grope for the wall
   like the blind, and as those who have no eyes shall they grope; they
   shall fall at noon-day as at midnight; when dead, they shall groan.
   They shall roar together as a bear, or as a dove [4293] .'

   This is the fruit of wickedness, these rewards are given to its
   familiars, for perverseness does not deliver its own. But in truth,
   against them it sets itself, and it tears them first, and on them
   especially it summons ruin. Woe to them against whom these are brought;
   for it is sharper than a two-edged sword [4294] ,' slaying beforehand
   and very swiftly those who will lay hold of it. For their tongue,
   according to the testimony of the Psalmist, is a sharp sword, and their
   teeth spears and arrows [4295] .' But the wonderful part is that while
   often he against whom men imagine [harm] suffers nothing, they are
   pierced by their own spears: for they possess, even in themselves,
   before they reach others, anger, wrath, malice, guile, hatred,
   bitterness. Although they may not be able to bring these upon others,
   they forthwith return upon and against themselves, as he prays, saying,
   Let their sword enter into their own heart.' There is also such a
   proverb as this: The wicked is held fast by the chain of his sins
   [4296] .'

   5. The Jews in their imaginings, and in their agreeing to act unjustly
   against the Lord, forgot that they were bringing wrath upon themselves.
   Therefore does the Word lament for them, saying, Why do the people
   exalt themselves, and the nations imagine vain things [4297] ?' For
   vain indeed was the imagination of the Jews, meditating death against
   the Life [4298] , and devising unreasonable things against the Word of
   the Father [4299] .' For who that looks upon their dispersion, and the
   desolation of their city, may not aptly say, Woe unto them, for they
   have imagined an evil imagination, saying against their own soul, let
   us bind the righteous man, because he is not pleasing to us [4300] .'
   And full well is it so, my brethren; for when they erred concerning the
   Scriptures, they knew not that he who diggeth a pit for his neighbour
   falleth therein; and he who destroyeth a hedge, a serpent shall bite
   him [4301] .' And if they had not turned their faces from the Lord,
   they would have feared what was written before in the divine Psalms:
   The heathen are caught in the pit which they made; in the snare which
   they hid is their own foot taken. The Lord is known when executing
   judgments: by the works of his hands is the sinner taken [4302] .' Let
   them observe this, and how that the snare they know not shall come upon
   them, and the net they hid take them [4303] .' But they understood not
   these things, for had they done so, they would not have crucified the
   Lord of glory [4304] .'

   6. Therefore the righteous and faithful servants of the Lord, who are
   made disciples for the kingdom of heaven, and bring forth from it
   things new and old;' and who meditate on the words of the Lord, when
   sitting in the house, when lying down or rising up, and when walking by
   the way [4305] ;'--since they are of good hope because of the promise
   of the Spirit which said, Blessed is the man that hath not walked in
   the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in
   the seat of corrupters; but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and
   in His law doth he meditate day and night [4306] ;'--being grounded in
   faith, rejoicing in hope, fervent in spirit, they have boldness to say,
   My mouth shall speak wisdom, and the meditation of my heart shall be of
   understanding.' And again, I have meditated on all Thy works, and on
   the work of Thy hands has been my meditation.' And, If I have
   remembered Thee on my bed, and in the morning have meditated on Thee
   [4307] .' Afterwards, advancing in boldness, they say, The meditation
   of my heart is before Thee at all times [4308] .' And what is the end
   of such an one? He cites immediately; The Lord is my Helper and my
   Redeemer [4309] .' For to those who thus examine themselves, and
   conform their hearts to the Lord, nothing adverse shall happen; for
   indeed, their heart is strengthened by confidence in the Lord, as it is
   written, They who trust in the Lord are as mount Sion: he who dwelleth
   in Jerusalem shall not be moved for ever [4310] .' For if at any time,
   the crafty one shall be presumptuously bold against them, chiefly that
   he may break the rank of the saints, and cause a division among
   brethren; even in this the Lord is with them, not only as an avenger on
   their behalf, but also when they have already been beaten, as a
   deliverer for them. For this is the divine promise; The Lord shall
   fight for you [4311] .' Henceforth, although afflictions and trials
   from without overtake them, yet, being fashioned after the apostolic
   words, and being stedfast in tribulations, and persevering in prayers
   [4312] ' and in meditation on the law, they stand against those things
   which befall them, are well-pleasing to God, and give utterance to the
   words which are written, Afflictions and distresses are come upon me;
   but Thy commandments are my meditation [4313] .'

   7. And whereas, not only in action, but also in the thoughts of the
   mind, men are moved to deeds of virtue, he afterwards adds, saying,
   Mine eyes prevent the dawn, that I might meditate on Thy words [4314]
   .' For it is meet that the spiritual meditations of those who are whole
   should precede their bodily actions. And does not our Saviour, when
   intending to teach this very thing begin with the thoughts of the mind?
   saying, Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath already
   committed adultery:' and, Whosoever shall be angry with his brother, is
   guilty of murder [4315] .' For where there is no wrath, murder is
   prevented; and where lust is first removed, there can be no accusation
   of adultery. Hence meditation on the law is necessary, my beloved, and
   uninterrupted converse with virtue, that the saint may lack nothing,
   but be perfect to every good work [4316] .' For by these things is the
   promise of eternal life, as Paul wrote to Timothy, calling constant
   meditation exercise, and saying, Exercise thyself unto godliness; for
   bodily exercise profiteth little; but godliness is profitable for all
   things, since it has the promise of the present life, and of that which
   is eternal [4317] .'

   8. Worthy of admiration is the virtue of that man, my brethren! for
   through Timothy he enjoins upon all [4318] , that they should have
   regard to nothing more than to godliness, but above everything to
   adjudge the chief place to faith in God. For what grace has the
   unrighteous man, though he may feign to keep the commandments? Nay
   rather, the unrighteous man is unable even to keep a portion of the
   law, for as is his mind, such of necessity must be his actions; as the
   Spirit says, reproving such; The fool hath said in his heart, there is
   no God.' After this the Word, shewing that actions correspond with
   thoughts, says, They are corrupt; they are profane in their
   machinations [4319] .' The unrighteous man then, in every respect
   corrupts his body; stealing, committing adultery, cursing, being
   drunken, and doing such like things. Even as Jeremiah, the prophet,
   convicts Israel of these things, crying out and saying, Oh, that I had
   a lodge far off in the wilderness! then would I leave my people and
   depart from them: for they are all adulterers, an assembly of
   oppressors, who draw out their tongue as a bow; lying and not truth has
   prevailed upon the earth, and they proceed from iniquities to
   iniquities; but Me they have not known [4320] .' Thus, for wickedness
   and falsehood, and for deeds, in which they [proceed] from iniquity to
   iniquity, he reproves their practices; but, because they knew not the
   Lord, and were faithless, he charges them with unrighteousness.

   9. For faith and godliness are allied to each other, and sisters; and
   he who believes in Him is godly, and he also who is godly, believes the
   more [4321] . He therefore who is in a state of wickedness, undoubtedly
   also wanders from the faith; and he who falls from godliness, falls
   from the true faith. Paul, for instance, bearing testimony to the same
   point, advises his disciple, saying, Avoid profane conversations; for
   they increase unto more ungodliness, and their word takes hold as doth
   a canker, of whom are HymenÃ¦us and Philetus [4322] .' In what their
   wickedness consisted he declares, saying, Who have erred from the
   faith, saying that the resurrection is already past [4323] .' But
   again, desirous of shewing that faith is yoked with godliness, the
   Apostle says, And all those who will live godly in Jesus Christ shall
   suffer persecution [4324] .' Afterwards, that no man should renounce
   godliness through persecution, he counsels them to preserve the faith,
   adding, Thou, therefore, continue in the things thou hast learned, and
   hast been assured of [4325] .' And as when brother is helped by
   brother, they become as a wall to each other; so faith and godliness,
   being of like growth, hang together, and he who is practised in the
   one, of necessity is strengthened by the other. Therefore, wishing the
   disciple to be exercised in godliness unto the end, and to contend for
   the faith, he counsels them, saying, Fight the good fight of faith, and
   lay hold on eternal life [4326] .' For if a man first put away the
   wickedness of idols, and rightly confesses Him Who is truly God, he
   next fights by faith with those who war against Him.

   10. For of these two things we speak of--faith and godliness--the hope
   is the same, even everlasting life; for he saith, Fight the good fight
   of faith; lay hold on eternal life.' And, exercise thyself unto
   godliness, for it hath the promise of the life that now is, and of that
   which is to come [4327] .' For this cause, the Ario-maniacs, who now
   have gone out from the Church, being opponents of Christ, have digged a
   pit of unbelief, into which they themselves have been thrust; and,
   since they have advanced in ungodliness, they overthrow the faith of
   the simple [4328] ;' blaspheming the Son of God, and saying that He is
   a creature, and has His being from things which are not. But as then
   against the adherents of Philetus and HymenÃ¦us, so now the Apostle
   forewarns all men against ungodliness like theirs, saying, The
   foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth
   them that are His; and, Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord
   depart from iniquity [4329] .' For it is well that a man should depart
   from wickedness and deeds of iniquity, that he may be able properly to
   celebrate the feast; for he who is defiled with the pollutions of the
   wicked is not able to sacrifice the Passover to the Lord our God.
   Hence, the people who were then in Egypt said, We cannot sacrifice the
   Passover in Egypt to the Lord our God [4330] .' For God, Who is over
   all, willed that they should go far away from the servants of Pharaoh,
   and from the furnace of iron; so that being set free from wickedness,
   and having carefully put away from them all strange notions, they might
   receive the knowledge of God and of virtuous actions. For He saith, Go
   far from them: depart from the midst of them, and touch not the unclean
   things [4331] .' For a man will not otherwise depart from sin, and lay
   hold on virtuous deeds, than by meditation on his acts; and when he has
   been practised by exercise in godliness, he will lay hold on the
   confession of faith [4332] , which also Paul, after he had fought the
   fight, possessed, namely, the crown of righteousness which was laid up;
   which the righteous Judge will give, not to him alone, but to all who
   are like him.

   11. For such meditation and exercise in godliness, being at all times
   the habit of the saints, is urgent on us at the present time, when the
   divine word desires us to keep the feast with them if we are in this
   disposition. For what else is the feast, but the constant worship of
   God, and the recognition of godliness, and unceasing prayers from the
   whole heart with agreement? So Paul wishing us to be ever in this
   disposition, commands, saying, Rejoice evermore; pray without ceasing;
   in everything give thanks [4333] .' Not therefore separately, but
   unitedly and collectively, let us all keep the feast together, as the
   prophet exhorts, saying, O come, let us rejoice in the Lord; let us
   make a joyful noise unto God our Saviour [4334] .' Who then is so
   negligent, or who so disobedient to the divine voice, as not to leave
   everything, and run to the general and common assembly of the feast?
   which is not in one place only, for not one place alone keeps the
   feast; but into all the earth their song has gone forth, and to the
   ends of the world their words.' And the sacrifice is not offered in one
   place, but in every nation, incense and a pure sacrifice is offered
   unto God [4335] .' So when in like manner from all in every place,
   praise and prayer shall ascend to the gracious and good Father, when
   the whole Catholic Church which is in every place, with gladness and
   rejoicing, celebrates together the same worship to God, when all men in
   common send up a song of praise and say, Amen [4336] ; how blessed will
   it not be, my brethren! who will not, at that time, be engaged, praying
   rightly? For the walls of every adverse power, yea even of Jericho
   especially, falling down, and the gift [4337] of the Holy Spirit being
   then richly poured upon all men, every man perceiving the coming of the
   Spirit shall say, We are all filled in the morning with Thy favour, and
   we rejoice and are made glad in our days [4338] .'

   12. Since this is so, let us make a joyful noise with the saints, and
   let no one of us fail of his duty in these things; counting as nothing
   the affliction or the trials which, especially at this time, have been
   enviously directed against us by the party of Eusebius. Even now they
   wish to injure us, and by their accusations to compass our death,
   because of that godliness, whose helper is the Lord. But, as faithful
   servants of God, knowing that He is our salvation in the time of
   trouble:--for our Lord promised beforehand, saying, Blessed are ye when
   men revile you and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against
   you falsely, for My sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad, for your
   reward is great in heaven [4339] .' Again, it is the Redeemer's own
   word, that affliction shall not befall every man in this world, but
   only those who have a holy fear of Him:--on this account, the more the
   enemies hem us in, the more let us be at liberty; although they revile
   us, let us come together; and the more they would turn us aside from
   godliness, let us the more boldly preach it saying, All these things
   are come upon us, yet have we not forgotten Thee [4340] ,' and we have
   not done evil with the Ario-maniacs, who say that Thou hast existence
   from those things that exist not. The Word which is eternally with the
   Father, is also from Him.

   13. Let us therefore keep the feast, my brethren, celebrating it not at
   all as an occasion of distress and mourning, neither let us mingle with
   heretics through temporal trials brought upon us by godliness. But if
   anything that would promote joy and gladness should offer, let us
   attend to it; so that our heart may not be sad, like that of Cain; but
   that, like faithful and good servants of the Lord, we may hear the
   words, Enter into the joy of thy Lord [4341] .' For we do not institute
   days of mourning and sorrow, as some may consider these of Easter to
   be, but we keep the feast, being filled with joy and gladness. We keep
   it then, not regarding it after the deceitful error of the Jews, nor
   according to the teaching of the Arians, which takes away the Son from
   the Godhead, and numbers Him among creatures; but we look to the
   correct doctrine we derive from the Lord. For the guile of the Jews,
   and the unbounded impiety of the Arians, cause nothing but sad
   reflections, for the former at the beginning slew the Lord; but these
   latter take away His position of having conquered that death to which
   the Jews brought Him, in that they say He is not the Creator, but a
   creature. For if He were a creature, He would have been holden by
   death; but if He was not holden by death, according to the Scriptures,
   He is not a creature, but the Lord of the creatures, and the subject
   [4342] of this immortal feast.

   14. For the Lord of death would abolish death, and being Lord, what He
   would was accomplished; for we have all passed from death unto life.
   But the imagination of the Jews, and of those who are like them, was
   vain, since the result was not such as they contemplated, but turned
   out adverse to themselves; and at both of them He that sitteth in the
   heaven shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision [4343] .'
   Hence, when our Saviour was led to death, He restrained the women who
   followed Him weeping, saying, Weep not for Me [4344] ;' meaning to shew
   that the Lord's death is an event, not of sorrow but of joy, and that
   He Who dies for us is alive. For He does not derive His being from
   those things which are not, but from the Father. It is truly a subject
   of joy, that we can see the signs of victory against death, even our
   own incorruptibility, through the body of the Lord. For since He rose
   gloriously, it is clear that the resurrection of all of us will take
   place; and since His body remained without corruption, there can be no
   doubt regarding our incorruption [4345] . For as by one man [4346] , as
   saith Paul (and it is the truth), sin passed upon all men, so by the
   resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, we shall all rise. For,' he
   says, this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must
   put on immortality [4347] .' Now this came to pass in the time of the
   Passion, in which our Lord died for us, for our Passover, Christ, is
   sacrificed [4348] .' Therefore, because He was sacrificed, let each of
   us feed upon Him, and with alacrity and diligence partake of His
   sustenance; since He is given to all without grudging, and is in every
   one a well of water flowing to everlasting life [4349] .'

   15. We begin the fast of forty days on the ninth of the month Phamenoth
   (Mar. 5); and having, in these days, served the Lord with abstinence,
   and first purified ourselves [4350] , we commence also the holy Easter
   on the fourteenth of the month Pharmuthi (April 9). Afterwards,
   extending the fast to the seventh day, on the seventeenth [4351] of the
   month, let us rest late in the evening. And the light of the Lord
   having first dawned upon us, and the holy Sunday on which our Lord rose
   shining upon us, we should rejoice and be glad with the joy which
   arises from good works, during the seven weeks which remain--to
   Pentecost--giving glory to the Father, and saying, This is the day
   which the Lord hath made: we will rejoice and be glad in it, [4352] '
   through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, through Whom to the same,
   and to His Father, be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
   Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the brethren who are with me
   salute you. That ye may have health in the Lord, I pray, brethren
   beloved.

   Here endeth the eleventh Letter of holy Athanasius.

   *XII.--(Probably for 340 a.d.) To the Beloved Brother, and our fellow
   Minister Serapion [4353] .

   Thanks be to Divine Providence for those things which, at all times, it
   vouchsafes to us; for it has vouchsafed to us now to come to the season
   of the festival. Having, therefore, according to custom, written the
   Letter respecting the festival, I have sent it to you, my beloved; that
   through you all the brethren may be able to know the day of rejoicing.
   But because some Meletians, being come from Syria, have boasted that
   they had received what does not belong to them, I mean, that they also
   were reckoned in the Catholic Church; on this account, I have sent to
   you a copy of one letter of our fellow-ministers who are of Palestine,
   that when it reaches you, you may know the fraud of the pretenders in
   this matter. For because they boasted, as I have said before, it was
   necessary for me to write to the Bishops who are in Syria, and
   immediately those of Palestine sent us a reply, having agreed in [4354]
   the judgment against them, as you may learn from this example. That you
   may not have to consider the letters of all the Bishops one after the
   other, I have sent you one, which is of like character with the rest,
   in order that from it you may know the purport of all of them. I know
   also that when they are convicted in this matter, they will incur
   perfect odium at the hands of all men. And thus far concerning the
   pretenders. But I have further deemed it highly necessary and very
   urgent, to make known to your modesty--for I have written this to each
   one--that you should proclaim the fast of forty days to the brethren,
   and persuade them to fast, lest, while all the world is fasting, we who
   are in Egypt should be derided, as the only people who do not fast, but
   take our pleasure in these days. For if, on account of the Letter [not]
   being yet read, we do not fast, we should take away this pretext, and
   it should be read before the fast of forty days, so that they may not
   make this an excuse for neglect or fasting. Also, when it is read, they
   may be able to learn about the fast. But O, my beloved, whether in this
   way or any other, persuade and teach them to fast the forty days. For
   it is a disgrace that when all the world does this, those alone who are
   in Egypt, instead of fasting, should find their pleasure. For even I
   being grieved because men deride us for this, have been constrained to
   write to you. When therefore you receive the letters, and have read
   them and given the exhortation, write to me in return, my beloved, that
   I also may rejoice upon learning it.

   2. But I have also thought it necessary to inform [4355] you of the
   fact, that Bishops have succeeded those who have fallen asleep. In
   Tanis in the stead of Elias [4356] , is Theodorus. In Arsenoitis,
   Silvanus [4357] instead of Calosiris. In Paralus, Nemesion is instead
   of Nonnus [4358] . In Bucolia [4359] is Heraclius. In Tentyra,
   Andronicus is instead of Saprion [4360] , his father. In Thebes, Philon
   instead of Philon. In Maximianopolis, Herminus instead of Atras. In the
   lower Apollon is Sarapion instead of Plution. In Aphroditon, Serenus is
   in the place of Theodorus. In Rhinocoruron, Salomon. In Stathma,
   Arabion, and in Marmarica. In the eastern Garyathis, Andragathius
   [4361] in the place of Hierax. In the southern Garyathis, Quintus
   [4362] instead of Nicon [4363] . So that to these you may write, and
   from these receive the canonical Letters.

   Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the brethren who are with me
   salute you.

   He wrote this from Rome. There is no twelfth Letter.

   [4353] This Letter being introduced (as it is in the ms.) after the
   eleventh, with the remark at the end of it, that there is no twelfth;
   together with the exhortations concerning fasting contained in it, was
   probably written in lieu of a twelfth. Serapion was doubtless the
   Bishop of Thmuis (see Letter 54).

   [4355] There is a similar notification of the appointment of fresh
   Bishops appended to the nineteenth Letter.

   284, &c. (L.) The word Tanis is the LXX. rendering of Zoan.' In the
   Apol. c. Ar. 50, we have a list of ninety-four Egyptian Bishops, among
   others, who subscribed to the letter of the Council of Sardica. A
   reference to this list explains some names which otherwise would have
   been obscure. For a list of the Egyptian Bishoprics, the reader is
   referred to Neale's Hist. of the Holy Eastern Church. Gen. Introd. vol.
   i. pp. 115, 116. To the list there given must be added the names of
   Bucolia, Stathma, the Eastern Garyathis, the Southern Garyathis. There
   were two Egyptian Bishops named Elias who subscribed their names to the
   letter of the Council of Sardica.

   [4357] Silvanus was succeeded by Andreas, as we learn from the
   postscript to the nineteenth Letter.

   Letter XIII.--(For 341.) Coss. Marcellinus, Probinus; PrÃ¦f. Longinus;

   57.

   Again, my beloved brethren, I am ready to notify to you the saving
   feast [4364] , which will take place according to annual custom. For
   although the opponents of Christ [4365] have oppressed you together
   with us with afflictions and sorrows; yet, God having comforted us by
   our mutual faith [4366] , behold, I write to you even from Rome.
   Keeping the feast here with the brethren, still I keep it with you also
   in will and in spirit, for we send up prayers in common to God, Who
   hath granted us not only to believe in Him, but also now to suffer for
   His sake [4367] .' For troubled as we are, because we are so far from
   you, He moves us to write, that by a letter we might comfort ourselves,
   and provoke one another to good [4368] . For, indeed, numerous
   afflictions and bitter persecutions directed against the Church have
   been against us. For heretics, corrupt in their mind, untried in the
   faith, rising against the truth, violently persecute the Church, and of
   the brethren, some are scourged and others torn with stripes, and
   hardest of all, their insults reach even to the Bishops. Nevertheless,
   it is not becoming, on this account, that we should neglect the feast.
   But we should especially remember it, and not at all forget its
   commemoration from time to time. Now the unbelievers do not consider
   that there is a season for feasts, because they spend all their lives
   in revelling and follies; and the feasts which they keep are an
   occasion of grief rather than of joy. But to us in this present life
   they are above all an uninterrupted passage [to heaven]--it is indeed
   our season. For such things as these serve for exercise and trial, so
   that, having approved ourselves zealous and chosen servants of Christ,
   we may be fellow-heirs with the saints [4369] . For thus Job: The whole
   world is a place of trial to men upon the earth [4370] .' Nevertheless,
   they are proved in this world by afflictions, labours, and sorrows, to
   the end that each one may receive of God such reward as is meet for
   him, as He saith by the prophet, I am the Lord, Who trieth the hearts,
   and searcheth the reins, to give to every one according to his ways
   [4371] .'

   2. Not that He first knows the things of a man on his being proved (for
   He knows them all before they come to pass), but because He is good and
   philanthropic, He distributes to each a due reward according to his
   actions, so that every man may exclaim, Righteous is the judgment of
   God! As the prophet says again, The Lord trieth the just, and
   discerneth the reins [4372] .' Again, for this cause He tries each one
   of us, either that to those who know it not, virtue may be manifested
   by means of those who are proved, as was said respecting Job; Thinkest
   thou that I was revealed to thee for any other cause, than that thou
   shouldest be seen righteous [4373] ?' or that, when men come to a sense
   of their deeds, they may be able to know of what manner they are, and
   so may either repent of their wickedness, or abide confirmed in the
   faith. Now the blessed Paul, when troubled by afflictions, and
   persecutions, and hunger and thirst, in everything was a conqueror,
   through Jesus Christ, Who loved us [4374] .' Through suffering he was
   weak indeed in body, yet, believing and hoping, he was made strong in
   spirit, and his strength was made perfect in weakness [4375] .

   3. The other saints also, who had a like confidence in God, accepted a
   like probation with gladness, as Job said, Blessed be the name of the
   Lord [4376] .' But the Psalmist, Search me, O Lord, and try me: prove
   my reins and my heart [4377] .' For since, when the strength is proved,
   it convinceth the foolish, they perceiving the cleansing and the
   advantage resulting from the divine fire, were not discouraged in
   trials like these, but they rather delighted in them, suffering no
   injury at all from the things which happened, but being seen to shine
   more brightly, like gold from the fire [4378] , as he said, who was
   tried in such a school of discipline as this; Thou hast tried my heart,
   Thou hast visited me in the night-season; Thou hast proved me, and hast
   not found iniquity in me, so that my mouth shall not speak of the works
   of men [4379] .' But those whose actions are not restrained by law, who
   know of nothing beyond eating and drinking and dying, account trials as
   danger. They soon stumble at them, so that, being untried in the faith,
   they are given over to a reprobate mind, and do those things which are
   not seemly [4380] . Therefore the blessed Paul, when urging us to such
   exercises as these, and having before measured himself by them, says,
   Therefore I take pleasure in afflictions, in infirmities.' And again,
   Exercise thyself unto godliness [4381] .' For since he knew the
   persecutions that befel those who chose to live in godliness, he wished
   his disciples to meditate beforehand on the difficulties connected with
   godliness; that when trials should come, and affliction arise, they
   might be able to bear them easily, as having been exercised in these
   things. For in those things wherewith a man has been conversant in
   mind, he ordinarily experiences a hidden joy. In this way, the blessed
   martyrs, becoming at first conversant with difficulties, were quickly
   perfected in Christ, regarding as nought the injury of the body, while
   they contemplated the expected rest.

   4. But all those who call their lands by their own names [4382] ,' and
   have wood, and hay, and stubble [4383] in their thoughts; such as
   these, since they are strangers to difficulties, become aliens from the
   kingdom of heaven. Had they however known that tribulation perfecteth
   patience, and patience experience, and experience hope, and hope maketh
   not ashamed,' they would have exercised themselves, after the example
   of Paul, who said, I keep under my body and bring it into subjection,
   lest when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway
   [4384] .' They would easily have borne the afflictions which were
   brought upon them to prove them from time to time, if the prophetic
   admonition [4385] had been listened to by them; It is good for a man to
   take up Thy yoke in his youth; he shall sit alone and shall be silent,
   because he hath taken Thy yoke upon him. He will give his cheek to him
   who smiteth him; he will be filled with reproaches. Because the Lord
   does not cast away for ever; for when He abases, He is gracious,
   according to the multitude of His tender mercies [4386] .' For though
   all these things should proceed from the enemies, stripes, insults,
   reproaches, yet shall they avail nothing against the multitude of God's
   tender mercies; for we shall quickly recover from them since they are
   merely temporal, but God is always gracious, pouring out His tender
   mercies on those who please [Him]. Therefore, my beloved brethren, we
   should not look at these temporal things, but fix our attention on
   those which are eternal. Though affliction may come, it will have an
   end, though insult and persecution, yet are they nothing to the hope
   which is set [before us]. For all present matters are trifling compared
   with those which are future; the sufferings of this present time not
   being worthy to be compared with the hope that is to come [4387] . For
   what can be compared with the kingdom? or what is there in comparison
   with life eternal? Or what is all we could give here, to that which we
   shall inherit yonder? For we are heirs of God, and joint-heirs with
   Christ [4388] .' Therefore it is not right, my beloved, to consider
   afflictions and persecutions, but the hopes which are laid up for us
   because of persecutions.

   5. Now to this the example of Issachar, the patriarch, may persuade, as
   the Scripture [4389] saith, Issachar desires that which is good,
   resting between the heritages; and when he saw that the rest was good,
   and the land fertile [4390] , he bowed his shoulder to labour, and
   became a husbandman.' Being consumed by divine love, like the spouse in
   the Canticles, he gathered abundance from the holy Scriptures, for his
   mind was captivated not by the old alone, but by both the heritages.
   And hence as it were, spreading his wings, he beheld afar off the rest'
   which is in heaven, and,--since this land' consists of such beautiful
   works,--how much more truly the heavenly [country] must also [consist]
   of such [4391] ; for the other is ever new, and grows not old. For this
   land' passes away, as the Lord said; but that which is ready to receive
   the saints is immortal. Now when Issachar, the patriarch, saw these
   things, he joyfully made his boast of afflictions and toils, bowing his
   shoulders that he might labour. And he did not contend with those who
   smote him, neither was he disturbed by insults; but like a strong man
   triumphing the more by these things, and the more earnestly tilling his
   land, he received profit from it. The Word scattered the seed, but he
   watchfully cultivated it, so that it brought forth fruit, even a
   hundred-fold.

   6. Now what does this mean, my beloved, but that we also, when the
   enemies are arrayed against us, should glory in afflictions [4392] ,
   and that when we are persecuted, we should not be discouraged, but
   should the rather press after the crown of the high calling [4393] in
   Christ Jesus our Lord? and that being insulted, we should not be
   disturbed, but should give our cheek to the smiter, and bow the
   shoulder? For the lovers of pleasure and the lovers of enmity are
   tried, as saith the blessed Apostle James, when they are drawn away by
   their own lusts and enticed [4394] .' But let us, knowing that we
   suffer for the truth, and that those who deny the Lord smite and
   persecute us, count it all joy, my brethren,' according to the words of
   James, when we fall into trials of various temptations, knowing that
   the trial of our faith worketh patience [4395] .' Let us rejoice as we
   keep the feast, my brethren, knowing that our salvation is ordered in
   the time of affliction. For our Saviour did not redeem us by
   inactivity, but by suffering for us He abolished death. And respecting
   this, He intimidated to us before, saying, In the world ye shall have
   tribulation [4396] .' But He did not say this to every man, but to
   those who diligently and faithfully perform good service to Him,
   knowing beforehand, that they should be persecuted who would live godly
   toward Him.

   7. But evil-doers and sorcerers will wax worse and worse, deceiving and
   being deceived [4397] .' If therefore, like those expounders of dreams
   and false prophets who professed to give signs, these ignorant men
   being drunk, not with wine, but with their own wickedness, make a
   profession of priesthood, and glory in their threats, believe them not;
   but since we are tried, let us humble ourselves, not being drawn away
   by them. For so God warned His people by Moses, saying, If there shall
   rise up among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and shall give
   signs and tokens, and the sign or the token shall come to pass which he
   spake to thee, saying, Let us go and serve strange gods, which ye have
   not known; ye shall not hearken unto the words of that prophet or that
   dreamer of dreams. For the Lord your God trieth you, that He may know
   whether you will love the Lord your God with all your heart [4398] .'
   So we, when we are tried by these things, will not separate ourselves
   from the love of God. But let us now keep the feast, my beloved, not as
   introducing a day of suffering, but of joy in Christ, by Whom we are
   fed every day. Let us be mindful of Him Who was sacrificed in the days
   of the Passover; for we celebrate this, because Christ the Passover was
   sacrificed [4399] . He Who once brought His people out of Egypt, and
   hath now abolished death, and him that had the power of death, that is
   the devil [4400] , will likewise now turn him to shame, and again grant
   aid to those who are troubled, and cry unto God day and night [4401] .

   8. We begin the fast of forty days on the thirteenth of Phamenoth (9
   Mar.), and the holy week of Easter on the eighteenth of Pharmuthi (Apr.
   13); and resting on the seventh day, being the twenty-third (Apr. 18),
   and the first of the great week having dawned on the twenty-fourth of
   the same month Pharmuthi (Apr. 19), let us reckon from it till
   Pentecost. And at all times let us sing praises, calling on Christ,
   being delivered from our enemies by Christ Jesus our Lord, through Whom
   to the Father be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. Greet one
   another with a holy kiss. All those who are here with me salute you. I
   pray, my beloved brethren, that ye may have health in the Lord.

   He wrote this also from Rome. Here endeth the thirteenth Letter.

   PrÃ¦f. the same Longinus; Indict. xv; Easter-day iii Id. Apr., xvi
   Pharmuthi; Ã†ra Dioclet. 58.

   The gladness of our feast, my brethren, is always near at hand, and
   never fails those who wish to celebrate it [4402] . For the Word is
   near, Who is all things on our behalf, even our Lord Jesus Christ, Who,
   having promised that His habitation with us should be perpetual, in
   virtue thereof cried, saying, Lo, I am with you all the days of the
   world [4403] .' For as He is the Shepherd, and the High Priest, and the
   Way and the Door, and everything at once to us, so again, He is shewn
   to us as the Feast, and the Holy day, according to the blessed Apostle;
   Our Passover, Christ, is sacrificed [4404] .' He it was who was
   expected, He caused a light to shine at the prayer of the Psalmist, who
   said, My Joy, deliver me from those who surround me [4405] ;' this
   being indeed true rejoicing, this being a true feast, even deliverance
   from wickedness, whereto a man attains by thoroughly adopting an
   upright conversation, and being approved in his mind of godly
   submission towards God [4406] . For thus the saints all their lives
   long were like men rejoicing at a feast. One found rest in prayer to
   God, as blessed David [4407] , who rose in the night, not once but
   seven times. Another gave glory in songs of praise, as great Moses, who
   sang a song of praise for the victory over Pharaoh, and those
   task-masters [4408] . Others performed worship with unceasing
   diligence, like great Samuel and blessed Elijah; who have ceased from
   their course, and now keep the feast in heaven, and rejoice in what
   they formerly learnt through shadows, and from the types recognise the
   truth.

   2. But what sprinklings shall we now employ, while we celebrate the
   feast? Who will be our guide, as we haste to this festival? None can do
   this, my beloved, but Him Whom you will name with me, even our Lord
   Jesus Christ Who said, I am the Way.' For it is He Who, according to
   the blessed John, taketh away the sin of the world [4409] .' He
   purifies our souls, as Jeremiah the prophet says in a certain place,
   Stand in the ways and see, and enquire, and look which is the good
   path, and ye shall find in it cleansing for your souls [4410] .' Of old
   time, the blood of he-goats and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkled upon
   those who were unclean, were fit only to purify the flesh [4411] ; but
   now, through the grace of God the Word, every man is thoroughly
   cleansed. Following Him, we may, even here, as on the threshold of the
   Jerusalem which is above, meditate beforehand on the feast which is
   eternal, as also the blessed Apostles, together following the Saviour
   Who was their Leader, have now become teachers of a like grace, saying,
   Behold, we have left all, and followed Thee [4412] .' For the following
   of the Lord, and the feast which is of the Lord, is not accomplished by
   words only, but by deeds, every enactment of laws and every command
   involving a distinct performance. For as great Moses, when
   administering the holy laws, exacted a promise from the people [4413] ,
   respecting the practice of them, so that having promised, they might
   not neglect them, and be accused as liars, thus also, the celebration
   of the least of the Passover raises no question, and demands no reply;
   but when the word is given, the performance of it follows, for He
   saith, And the children of Israel shall keep the Passover [4414] ;'
   intending that there should be a ready performance of the commandment,
   while the command should aid its execution. But respecting these
   matters, I have confidence in your wisdom, and your care for
   instruction. Such points as these have been touched upon by us often
   and in various Letters.

   3. But now, which is above all things most necessary, I wish to remind
   you, and myself with you, how that the command would have us come to
   the Paschal feast not profanely and without preparation, but with
   sacramental and doctrinal rites, and prescribed observances, as indeed
   we learn from the historical account, A man who is of another nation,
   or bought with money, or uncircumcised, shall not eat the Passover
   [4415] .' Neither should it be eaten in any' house, but He commands it
   to be done in haste; inasmuch as before we groaned and were made sad by
   the bondage to Pharaoh, and the commands of the task-masters. For when
   in former time the children of Israel acted in this way, they were
   counted worthy to receive the type, which existed for the sake of this
   feast, nor is the feast now introduced on account of the type. As also
   the Word of God, when desirous of this, said to His disciples, With
   desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you [4416] .' Now that
   is a wonderful account, for a man might have seen them at that time
   girded as for a procession or a dance, and going out with staves, and
   sandals, and unleavened bread. These things, which took place before in
   shadows, were typical. But now the Truth is nigh unto us, the Image of
   the invisible God [4417] ,' our Lord Jesus Christ, the true Light, Who
   instead of a staff, is our sceptre, instead of unleavened bread, is the
   bread which came down from heaven, Who, instead of sandals, hath
   furnished us with the preparation of the Gospel [4418] , and Who, to
   speak briefly, by all these hath guided us to His Father. And if
   enemies afflict us and persecute us, He again, instead of Moses, will
   encourage us with better words, saying, Be of good cheer; I have
   overcome the wicked one [4419] .' And if after we have passed over the
   Red Sea heat should again vex us or some bitterness of the waters
   befall us, even thence again the Lord will appear to us, imparting to
   us of His sweetness, and His life-giving fountain, saying, If any man
   thirst, let him come to Me, and drink [4420] .'

   4. Why therefore do we tarry, and why do we delay, and not come with
   all eagerness and diligence to the feast, trusting that it is Jesus who
   calleth us? Who is all things for us, and was laden in ten thousand
   ways for our salvation; Who hungered and thirsted for us, though He
   gives us food and drink in His saving gifts [4421] . For this is His
   glory, this the miracle of His divinity, that He changed our sufferings
   for His happiness. For, being life, He died that He might make us
   alive, being the Word, He became flesh, that He might instruct the
   flesh in the Word, and being the fountain of life, He thirsted our
   thirst, that thereby He might urge us to the feast, saying, If any man
   thirst, let him come to Me, and drink [4422] .' At that time, Moses
   proclaimed the beginning of the feast, saying, This month is the
   beginning of months to you [4423] .' But the Lord, Who came down in the
   end of the ages [4424] , proclaimed a different day, not as though He
   would abolish the law, far from it, but that He should establish the
   law, and be the end of the law. For Christ is the end of the law to
   every one that believeth in righteousness;' as the blessed Paul saith,
   Do we make void the law by faith? far from it: we rather establish the
   law [4425] .' Now these things astonished even the officers who were
   sent by the Jews, so that wondering they said to the Pharisees, No man
   ever thus spake [4426] .' What was it then that astonished those
   officers, or what was it which so affected the men as to make them
   marvel? It was nothing but the boldness and authority of our Saviour.
   For when of old time prophets and scribes studied the Scriptures, they
   perceived that what they read did not refer to themselves, but to
   others. Moses, for instance, A prophet will the Lord raise up unto you
   of your brethren, like unto me; to him hearken in all that he commands
   you.' Isaiah again, Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and
   ye shall call his name Emmanuel [4427] .' And others prophesied in
   different and various ways, concerning the Lord. But by the Lord, of
   Himself, and of no other, were these things prophesied; to Himself He
   limited them all, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to Me [4428]
   '--not to any other person, but to Me.' A man may indeed hear from
   those concerning My coming, but he must not henceforth drink from
   others, but from Me.

   5. Therefore let us also, when we come to the feast, no longer come as
   to old shadows, for they are accomplished, neither as to common feasts,
   but let us hasten as to the Lord, Who is Himself the feast [4429] , not
   looking upon it as an indulgence and delight of the belly, but as a
   manifestation of virtue. For the feasts of the heathen are full of
   greediness, and utter indolence, since they consider they celebrate a
   feast when they are idle [4430] ; and they work the works of perdition
   when they feast. But our feasts consist in the exercise of virtue and
   the practice of temperance; as the prophetic word testifies in a
   certain place, saying, The fast of the fourth, and the fast of the
   fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth [month],
   shall be to the house of Judah for gladness, and rejoicing, and for
   pleasant feasts [4431] .' Since therefore this occasion for exercise is
   set before us, and such a day as this is come, and the prophetic voice
   has gone forth that the feast shall be celebrated, let us give all
   diligence to this good proclamation, and like those who contend on the
   race course, let us vie with each other in observing the purity of the
   fast [4432] , by watchfulness in prayers, by study of the Scriptures,
   by distributing to the poor, and let us be at peace with our enemies.
   Let us bind up those who are scattered abroad, banish pride, and return
   to lowliness of mind, being at peace with all men, and urging the
   brethren unto love. Thus also the blessed Paul was often engaged in
   fastings and watchings, and was willing to be accursed for his
   brethren. Blessed David again, having humbled himself by fastings, used
   boldness, saying, O Lord my God, if I have done this, if there is any
   iniquity in my hands, if I have repaid those who dealt evil with me,
   then may I fall from my enemies as a vain man [4433] .' If we do these
   things, we shall conquer death; and receive an earnest [4434] of the
   kingdom of heaven.

   6. We begin the holy Easter feast on the tenth of Pharmuthi (April 5),
   desisting from the holy fasts on the fifteenth of the same month
   Pharmuthi (April 10), on the evening of the seventh day. And let us
   keep the holy feast on the sixteenth of the same month Pharmuthi (April
   11); adding one by one [the days] till the holy Pentecost, passing on
   to which, as through a succession of feasts, let us keep the festival
   to the Spirit, Who is even now near us, in Jesus Christ, through Whom
   and with Whom to the Father be glory and dominion for ever and ever.
   Amen.

   The fifteenth and sixteenth are wanting.

   Athanasius to the Presbyters and Deacons of Alexandria, and to the
   beloved brethren, greeting in Christ.

   According to custom, I give you notice respecting Easter, my beloved,
   that you also may notify the same to the districts of those who are at
   a distance, as is usual. Therefore, after this present festival [4435]
   , I mean this which is on the twentieth of the month Pharmuthi, the
   Easter-day following will be on the vii Id. April, or according to the
   Alexandrians on the twelfth of Pharmuthi. Give notice therefore in all
   those districts, that Easter-day will be on the vii Id. April, or
   according to the Alexandrian reckoning on the twelfth of Pharmuthi.
   That you may be in health in Christ, I pray, my beloved brethren.

   [4435] Observe that Athan. gives notice at Easter, a.d. 344, upon what
   day Easter is to be observed in a.d. 345, and not immediately after the
   succeeding Epiphany, as Cassian asserts to have been the custom of the
   Patriarch of Alexandria. (Cassian. Collat. x. 1.) Cf. Letters 2, 4, 10,

   Athanasius, to the Presbyters and Deacons of Alexandria, brethren
   beloved in the Lord, greeting.

   You have done well, dearly beloved brethren, that you have given the
   customary notice of the holy Easter in those districts; for I have seen
   and acknowledged your exactness. By other letters I have also given you
   notice, that when this year is finished, ye may know concerning the
   next. Yet now I have thought it necessary to write the same things
   that, when you have it exactly, you also may write with care.
   Therefore, after the conclusion of this feast, which is now drawing to
   its close, on the twelfth of the month Pharmuthi, which is on the vii
   Id. Apr. [4436] , Easter-day will be on the iii Kal, April; the fourth
   of Pharmuthi, according to the Alexandrians. When therefore the feast
   is finished, give notice again in these districts, according to early
   custom, thus: Easter Sunday is on the iii Kal. April, which is the
   fourth of Pharmuthi, according to the Alexandrian reckoning. And let no
   man hesitate concerning the day, neither let any one contend, saying,
   It is requisite that Easter should be held on the twenty-seventh of the
   month Phamenoth; for it was discussed in the holy Synod [4437] , and
   all there settled it to be on the iii Kal. April. I say then that it is
   on the fourth of the month Pharmuthi; for the week before this is much
   too early [4438] . Therefore let there be no dispute, but let us act as
   becometh us. For I have thus written to the Romans also. Give notice
   then as it has been notified to you, that it is on the iii Kal. April;
   the fourth of Pharmuthi, according to the Alexandrian reckoning.

   That ye may have health in the Lord, I pray, my dearly beloved
   brethren.

   [4438] The 14th day of the Moon, reckoning from the time of mean New
   Moon, took place on Sunday the 23rd. According to the rule which
   obtained in later times and continued in use until the Gregorian
   reformation of the Calendar, the 14th day of the Ecclesiastical Moon
   took place on Saturday the 22nd, which would make Easter-day happen on
   the 23rd. It would seem, therefore, that the decision of the Synod
   referred to, brought the Ecclesiastical Moon into closer accordance
   with that of the heavens, than the later Calendar would have done. In
   357 Easter was apparently kept on Mar. 23.

   Dioclet. 63; Moon 15.

   Blessed is God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ [4439] ,' for such
   an introduction is fitting for an Epistle, and more especially now,
   when it brings thanksgiving to the Lord, in the Apostle's words,
   because He hath brought us from a distance, and granted us again to
   send openly to you, as usual, the Festal Letters. For this is the
   season of the feast, my brethren, and it is near; being not now
   proclaimed by trumpets, as the history records [4440] , but being made
   known and brought near to us by the Saviour, Who suffered on our behalf
   and rose again, even as Paul preached, saying, Our Passover, Christ, is
   sacrificed [4441] .' Henceforth the feast of the Passover is ours, not
   that of a stranger, nor is it any longer of the Jews [4442] . For the
   time of shadows is abolished, and those former things have ceased, and
   now the month of new things [4443] is at hand, in which every man
   should keep the feast, in obedience to Him who said, Observe the month
   of new things, and keep the Passover to the Lord thy God [4444] .' Even
   the heathen fancy they keep festival, and the Jews hypo-critically
   feign to do so. But the feast of the heathen He reproves, as the bread
   [4445] of mourners, and He turns His face from that of the Jews, as
   being outcasts, saying, Your new moons and your sabbaths My soul hateth
   [4446] .'

   2. For actions not done lawfully and piously, are not of advantage,
   though they may be reputed to be so, but they rather argue hypocrisy in
   those who venture upon them. Therefore, although such persons feign to
   offer sacrifices, yet they hear from the Father, Your whole
   burnt-offerings are not acceptable, and your sacrifices do not please
   Me; and although ye bring fine flour, it is vanity, incense also is an
   abomination unto Me [4447] .' For God does not need anything [4448] ;
   and, since nothing is unclean to Him, He is full in regard to them, as
   He testifies, by Isaiah, saying, I am full [4449] .' Now there was a
   law given about these things, for the instruction of the people, and to
   prefigure things to come, for Paul saith to the Galatians; Before faith
   came, we were kept guarded under the law, being shut up in the faith
   which should afterwards be revealed unto us; wherefore the law was our
   instructor in Christ, that we might be justified by faith [4450] .' But
   the Jews knew not, neither did they understand, therefore they walked
   in the daytime as in darkness, feeling for, but not touching, the truth
   we possess, which [was contained] in the law; conforming to the letter,
   but not submitting to the spirit. And when Moses was veiled, they
   looked on him, but turned away their faces from him when he was
   uncovered. For they knew not what they read, but erroneously
   substituted one thing for another. The prophet, therefore, cried
   against them, saying, Falsehood and faithlessness have prevailed among
   them.' The Lord also therefore said concerning them, The strange
   children have dealt falsely with Me; the strange children have waxen
   old [4451] .' But how gently does He reprove them, saying, Had ye
   believed Moses, ye would have believed Me, for he wrote of Me [4452] .'
   But being faithless, they went on to deal falsely with the law,
   affirming things after their own pleasure, but not understanding the
   Scripture; and, further, as they had hypocritically made a pretence of
   the plain text of Scripture, and had confidence in this, He is angry
   with them, saying by Isaiah, Who hath required these of your hands
   [4453] ?' And by Jeremiah, since they were very bold, he threatens,
   Gather together your whole burnt-offerings with your sacrifices, and
   eat flesh, for I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the
   day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning whole
   burnt-offerings and sacrifices [4454] .' For they did not act as was
   right, neither was their zeal according to law, but they rather sought
   their own pleasure in such days, as the prophet accuses them, beating
   down their bondsmen, and gathering themselves together for strifes and
   quarrels, and they smote the lowly with the fist, and did all things
   that tended to their own gratification. For this cause, they continue
   without a feast until the end, although they make a display now of
   eating flesh, out of place and out of season. For, instead of the
   legally-appointed lamb, they have learned to sacrifice to Baal; instead
   of the true unleavened bread, they collect the wood, and their fathers
   kindle the fire, and their wives prepare the dough, that they may make
   cakes to the host of heaven, and pour out libations to strange gods,
   that they may provoke Me to anger, saith the Lord [4455] .' They have
   the just reward of such devices, since, although they pretend to keep
   the Passover, yet joy and gladness is taken from their mouth, as saith
   Jeremiah, There hath been taken away from the cities of Judah, and the
   streets of Jerusalem, the voice of those who are glad, and the voice of
   those who rejoice; the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the
   bride [4456] .' Therefore now, he who among them sacrificeth an ox, is
   as he who smiteth a man, and he who sacrificeth a lamb is as he who
   killeth a dog, he that offereth fine flour, is as [if he offered]
   swine's blood, he that giveth frankincense for a memorial, is as a
   blasphemer [4457] .' Now these things will never please God, neither
   thus hath the word required of them. But He saith, These have chosen
   their own ways; and their abominations are what their soul delighteth
   in [4458] .'

   3. And what does this mean my brethren? For it is right for us to
   investigate the saying of the prophet, and especially on account of
   heretics who have turned their mind against the law. By Moses then, God
   gave commandment respecting sacrifices, and all the book called
   Leviticus is entirely taken up with the arrangement of these matters,
   so that He might accept the offerer. So through the Prophets, He blames
   him who despised these things, as disobedient to the commandment
   saying, I have not required these at your hands. Neither did I speak to
   your fathers respecting sacrifices, nor command them concerning whole
   burnt-offerings [4459] .' Now it is the opinion of some, that the
   Scriptures do not agree together, or that God, Who gave the
   commandment, is false. But there is no disagreement whatever, far from
   it, neither can the Father, Who is truth, lie; for it is impossible
   that God should lie [4460] ,' as Paul affirms. But all these things are
   plain to those who rightly consider them, and to those who receive with
   faith the writings of the law. Now it appears to me--may God grant, by
   your prayers, that the remarks I presume to make may not be far from
   the truth--that not at first were the commandment and the law
   concerning sacrifices, neither did the mind of God, Who gave the law,
   regard whole burnt-offerings, but those things which were pointed out
   and prefigured by them. For the law contained a shadow of good things
   to come.' And, Those things were appointed until the time of
   reformation [4461] .'

   4. Therefore, the whole law did not treat of sacrifices, though there
   was in the law a commandment concerning sacrifices, that by means of
   them it might begin to instruct men and might withdraw them from idols,
   and bring them near to God, teaching them for that present time.
   Therefore neither at the beginning, when God brought the people out of
   Egypt, did He command them concerning sacrifices or whole
   burnt-offerings, nor even when they came to mount Sinai. For God is not
   as man, that He should be careful about these things beforehand; but
   His commandment was given, that they might know Him Who is truly God,
   and His Word, and might despise those which are falsely called gods,
   which are not, but appear in outward show. So He made Himself known to
   them in that He brought them out of Egypt, and caused them to pass
   through the Red Sea. But when they chose to serve Baal, and dared to
   offer sacrifices to those that have no existence, and forgot the
   miracles which were wrought in their behalf in Egypt, and thought of
   returning thither again; then indeed, after the law, that commandment
   concerning sacrifices was ordained as law; so that with their mind,
   which at one time had meditated on those which are not, they might turn
   to Him Who is truly God, and learn not, in the first place, to
   sacrifice, but to turn away their faces from idols, and conform to what
   God commanded. For when He saith, I have not spoken concerning
   sacrifices, neither given commandment concerning whole
   burnt-offerings,' He immediately adds, But this is the thing which I
   commanded them, saying, Obey My voice, and I will be to you a God, and
   ye shall be to Me a people, and ye shall walk in all the ways that I
   command you [4462] .' Thus then, being before instructed and taught,
   they learned not to do service to any one but the Lord. They attained
   to know what time the shadow should last, and not to forget the time
   that was at hand, in which no longer should the bullock of the herd be
   a sacrifice to God, nor the ram of the flock, nor the he-goat [4463] ,
   but all these things should be fulfilled in a purely spiritual manner,
   and by constant prayer, and upright conversation, with godly words; as
   David sings, May my meditation be pleasing to Him. Let my prayer be set
   forth before Thee as incense, and the lifting up of my hands as the
   evening sacrifice [4464] .' The Spirit also, who is in him, commands,
   saying, Offer unto God the sacrifice of praise, and pay to the Lord thy
   vows. Offer the sacrifice of righteousness, and put your trust in the
   Lord [4465] .'

   5. Samuel, that great man, no less clearly reproved Saul, saying, Is
   not the word better than a gift [4466] ?' For hereby a man fulfils the
   law, and pleases God, as He saith, The sacrifice of praise shall
   glorify Me.' Let a man learn what this means, I will have mercy, and
   not sacrifice [4467] ,' and I will not condemn the adversaries. But
   this wearied them, for they were not anxious to understand, for had
   they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory [4468] .'
   And what their end is, the prophet foretold, crying, Woe unto their
   soul, for they have devised an evil thought, saying, let us bind the
   just man, because he is not pleasing to us [4469] .' The end of such
   abandonment as this can be nothing but error, as the Lord, when
   reproving them, saith, Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures [4470] .'
   Afterwards when, being reproved, they should have come to their senses,
   they rather grew insolent, saying, We are Moses' disciples; and we know
   that God spake to Moses [4471] ;' dealing the more falsely by that very
   expression, and accusing themselves. For had they believed him to whom
   they hearkened, they would not have denied the Lord, Who spake by
   Moses, when He was present. Not so did the eunuch in the Acts, for when
   he heard, Understandest thou what thou readest [4472] ?' he was not
   ashamed to confess his ignorance, and implored to be taught. Therefore,
   to him who became a learner, the grace of the Spirit was given. But as
   for those Jews who persisted in their ignorance; as the proverb saith,
   Death came upon them. For the fool dies in his sins [4473] .'

   6. Like these too, are the heretics, who, having fallen from true
   discernment, dare to invent to themselves atheism. For the fool saith
   in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, and become abominable
   in their doings [4474] .' Of such as are fools in their thoughts, the
   actions are wicked, as He saith, can ye, being evil, speak good things
   [4475] ;' for they were evil, because they thought wickedness. Or how
   can those do just acts, whose minds are set upon fraud? Or how shall he
   love, who is prepared beforehand to hate? How shall he be merciful, who
   is bent upon the love of money? How shall he be chaste, who looks upon
   a woman to lust after her? For from the heart proceed evil thoughts,
   fornications, adulteries, murders [4476] .' By them the fool is
   wrecked, as by the waves of the sea, being led away and enticed by his
   fleshly pleasures; for this stands written, All flesh of fools is
   greatly tempest-tossed [4477] .' While he associates with folly, he is
   tossed by a tempest, and perishes, as Solomon says in the Proverbs, The
   fool and he who lacketh understanding shall perish together, and shall
   leave their wealth to strangers [4478] .' Now they suffer such things,
   because there is not among them one sound of mind to guide them. For
   where there is sagacity, there the Word, who is the Pilot of souls, is
   with the vessel; for he that hath understanding shall possess guidance
   [4479] ;' but they who are without guidance fall like the leaves. Who
   has so completely fallen away as HymenÃ¦us and Philetus, who held evil
   opinions respecting the resurrection, and concerning faith in it
   suffered shipwreck? And Judas being a traitor, fell away from the
   Pilot, and perished with the Jews [4480] . But the disciples since they
   were wise, and therefore remained with the Lord, although the sea was
   agitated, and the ship covered with the waves, for there was a storm,
   and the wind was contrary, yet fell not away. For they awoke the Word,
   Who was sailing with them [4481] , and immediately the sea became
   smooth at the command of its Lord, and they were saved. They became
   preachers and teachers at the same time; relating the miracles of our
   Saviour, and teaching us also to imitate their example. These things
   were written on our account and for our profit, so that through these
   signs we may acknowledge the Lord Who wrought them.

   7. Let us, therefore, in the faith of the disciples, hold frequent
   converse with our Master. For the world is like the sea to us, my
   brethren, of which it is written, This is the great and wide sea, there
   go the ships; the Leviathan, which Thou hast created to play therein
   [4482] .' We float on this sea, as with the wind, through our own
   free-will, for every one directs his course according to his will, and
   either, under the pilotage of the Word, he enters into rest, or, laid
   hold on by pleasure, he suffers shipwreck, and is in peril by storm.
   For as in the ocean there are storms and waves, so in the world there
   are many afflictions and trials. The unbelieving therefore when
   affliction or persecution ariseth is offended [4483] ,' as the Lord
   said. For not being confirmed in the faith, and having his regard
   towards temporal things, he cannot resist the difficulties which arise
   from afflictions. But like that house, built on the sand by the foolish
   man, so he, being without understanding [4484] , falls before the
   assault of temptations, as it were by the winds. But the saints, having
   their senses exercised in self-possession [4485] , and being strong in
   faith, and understanding the word, do not faint under trials; but
   although, from time to time, circumstances of greater trial are set
   against them, yet they continue faithful, and awaking the Lord Who is
   with them, they are delivered. So, passing through water and fire, they
   find relief and duly keep the feast, offering up prayers with
   thanksgiving to God Who has redeemed them. For either being tempted
   they are known, like Abraham, or suffering they are approved, like Job,
   or being oppressed and deceitfully treated, like Joseph, they patiently
   endure it, or being persecuted, they are not overtaken; but as it is
   written, through God they leap over the wall [4486] ' of wickedness,
   which divides and separates between brethren, and turns them from the
   truth. In this manner the blessed Paul, when he took pleasure in
   infirmities, in reproach, in necessities, in persecutions, and in
   distresses for Christ, rejoiced, and wished all of us to rejoice
   saying, Rejoice always; in everything give thanks [4487] .'

   8. For what is so fitting for the feast, a turning from wickedness, and
   a pure conversation, and prayer offered without ceasing to God, with
   thanksgiving? Therefore let us, my brethren, looking forward to
   celebrate the eternal joy in heaven, keep the feast here also,
   rejoicing at all times, praying incessantly, and in everything giving
   thanks to the Lord. I give thanks to God, for those other wonders He
   has done, and for the various helps that have now been granted us, in
   that though He hath chastened us sore, He did not deliver us over to
   death, but brought us from a distance even as from the ends of the
   earth, and hath united us again with you. I have been mindful while I
   keep the feast, to give you also notice of the great feast of Easter,
   that so we may go up together, as it were, to Jerusalem, and eat the
   Passover, not separately but as in one house [4488] ; let us not as
   sodden in water, water down the word of God; neither let us, as having
   broken its bones, destroy the commands of the Gospel. But as roasted
   with fire, with bitterness, being fervent in spirit, in fastings and
   watchings, with lying on the ground, let us keep it with penitence and
   thanksgiving.

   9. We begin the fast of forty days on the sixth day of Phamenoth (Mar.
   2); and having passed through that properly, with fasting and prayers,
   we may be able to attain to the holy day. For he who neglects to
   observe the fast of forty days, as one who rashly and impurely treads
   on holy things, cannot celebrate the Easter festival. Further, let us
   put one another in remembrance, and stimulate one another not to be
   negligent, and especially that we should fast those days, so that fasts
   may receive us in succession, and we may rightly bring the feast to a
   close.

   10. The fast of forty days begins then, as was already said, on the
   sixth of Phamenoth (Mar. 2), and the great week of the Passion on the
   eleventh of Pharmuthi (Apr. 6). And let us rest from the fast on the
   sixteenth of it (Apr. 11), on the seventh day, late in the evening. Let
   us keep the feast when the first of the week dawns upon us, on the
   seventeenth of the same month Pharmuthi (Apr. 12). Let us then add, one
   after the other, the seven holy weeks of Pentecost, rejoicing and
   praising God, that He hath by these things made known to us beforehand,
   joy and rest everlasting, prepared in heaven for us and for those who
   truly believe in Christ Jesus our Lord; through Whom, and with Whom, be
   glory and dominion to the Father, with the Holy Ghost, for ever and
   ever. Amen.

   Salute one another with a holy kiss. The brethren who are with me
   salute you.

   [4489] I have also thought it necessary to inform you of the
   appointment of Bishops, which has taken place in the stead of our
   blessed fellow-ministers, that ye may know to whom to write, and from
   whom ye should receive letters. In Syene, therefore, Nilammon, instead
   of Nilammon of the same name. In Latopolis, Masis, instead of Ammonius.
   In Coptos, Psenosiris [4490] , instead of Theodorus [4491] . In
   Panopolis, because Artemidorus [4492] desired it, on account of his old
   age, and weakness of body, Arius is appointed coadjutor. In Hypsele,
   Arsenius, having become reconciled to the Church. In Lycopolis, EudÃ¦mon
   [4493] in the stead of Plusianus [4494] . In AntinoÃ¶polis, Arion [4495]
   , instead of Ammonius and Tyrannus [4496] . In Oxyrynchus, Theodorus,
   instead of Pelagius. In Nilopolis, instead of Theon, Amatus [4497] ,
   and Isaac, who are reconciled to each other. In Arsenoitis, Andreas
   [4498] , instead of Silvanus [4499] . In Prosopitis, Triadelphus,
   instead of Serapammon [4500] . In Diosphacus, on the river side,
   Theodorus, instead of Serapammon. In Sais, Paphnutius, instead of
   Nemesion. In Xois, Theodorus, instead of Anubion; and there is also
   with him Isidorus, who is reconciled to the Church. In Sethroitis,
   Orion [4501] , instead of Potammon [4502] . In Clysma, Tithonas [4503]
   , instead of Jacob; and there is with him Paulus, who has been
   reconciled to the Church.

   Dioclet. 64; Moon 18.

   Let us now keep the feast, my brethren, for as our Lord then gave
   notice to His disciples, so He now tells us beforehand, that after some
   days is the Passover [4504] ,' in which the Jews indeed betrayed the
   Lord, but we celebrate His death as a feast, rejoicing because we then
   obtained rest from our afflictions. We are diligent in assembling
   ourselves together, for we were scattered in time past and were lost,
   and are found. We were far off, and are brought nigh, we were
   strangers, and have become His, Who suffered for us, and was nailed on
   the cross, Who bore our sins, as the prophet [4505] saith, and was
   afflicted for us, that He might put away from all of us grief, and
   sorrow, and sighing. When we thirst, He satisfies us on the feast-day
   itself; standing and crying, If any man thirst, let him come to Me, and
   drink [4506] .' For such is the love of the saints at all times, that
   they never once leave off, but offer the uninterrupted, constant
   sacrifice to the Lord, and continually thirst, and ask of Him to drink
   [4507] ; as David sang, My God, my God, early will I seek Thee, my soul
   thirsteth for Thee; many times my heart and flesh longeth for Thee in a
   barren land, without a path, and without water. Thus was I seen by Thee
   in the sanctuary [4508] .' And Isaiah the prophet says, From the night
   my spirit seeketh Thee early, O God, because Thy commandments are light
   [4509] .' And another says, My soul fainteth for the longing it hath
   for Thy judgments at all times.' And again he says, For Thy judgments I
   have hoped, and Thy law will I keep at all times [4510] .' Another
   boldly cries out, saying, Mine eye is ever towards the Lord.' And with
   him one says, The meditation of my heart is before Thee at all times.'
   And Paul further advises, At all times give thanks; pray without
   ceasing [4511] .' Those who are thus continually engaged, are waiting
   entirely on the Lord, and say, Let us follow on to know the Lord: we
   shall find Him ready as the morning, and He will come to us as the
   early and the latter rain for the earth [4512] .' For not only does He
   satisfy them in the morning; neither does He give them only as much to
   drink as they ask; but He gives them abundantly according to the
   multitude of His lovingkindness, vouchsafing to them at all times the
   grace of the Spirit. And what it is they thirst for He immediately
   adds, saying, He that believeth on Me.' For, as cold waters are
   pleasant to those who are thirsty [4513] ,' according to the proverb,
   so to those who believe in the Lord, the coming of the Spirit is better
   than all refreshment and delight.

   2. It becomes us then in these days of the Passover, to rise early with
   the saints, and approach the Lord with all our soul, with purity of
   body, with confession and godly faith in Him; so that when we have here
   first drunk, and are filled with these divine waters which [flow] from
   Him, we may be able to sit at table with the saints in heaven, and may
   share in the one voice of gladness which is there. From this sinners,
   because it wearied them, are rightly cast out, and hear the words,
   Friend, how camest thou in hither, not having a wedding garment [4514]
   ?' Sinners indeed thirst, but not for the grace of the Spirit; but
   being inflamed with wickedness, they are wholly set on fire by
   pleasures, as saith the Proverb, All day long he desires evil desires.'
   But the Prophet cries against them, saying, Wo unto those who rise up
   early, and follow strong drink; who continue until the evening, for
   wine inflameth them [4515] .' And since they run wild in wantonness,
   they dare to thirst for the destruction of others. Having first drunk
   of lying and unfaithful waters, those things have come upon them, which
   are stated by the Prophet; My wound,' saith he, is grievous, whence
   shall I be healed; it hath surely been to me like deceitful waters, in
   which there is no trust [4516] .' Secondly, while they drink with their
   companions, they lead astray and disturb the right mind, and turn away
   the simple from it. And what does he cry? Wo unto him who causeth his
   neighbour to drink turbid destruction, and maketh him drunk, that he
   may look upon his caverns [4517] .' But those who dissemble, and steal
   away the truth, quench their hearts. Having first drunk of these
   things, they go on to say those things which the whore saith in the
   Proverbs, Lay hold with delight on hidden bread, and sweet stolen
   waters [4518] .' They lay snares secretly, because they have not the
   freedom of virtue, nor the boldness of Wisdom [4519] , who praises
   herself in the gates, and employs freedom of speech in the broad ways,
   preaching on high walls. For this reason, they are bidden to lay hold
   with delight [4520] ,' because, having the choice between faith and
   pleasures, they steal the sweetness of truth, and disguise their own
   bitter waters [to escape] from the blame of their wickedness, which
   would have been speedy and public. On this account, the wolf puts on
   the skin of the sheep, sepulchres deceive by their whitened exteriors
   [4521] . Satan, that is [4522] ...

   For who is our joy and boast, but our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
   Who suffered for us, and by Himself made known to us the Father? For He
   is no other than He Who of old time spoke by the Prophets; but now He
   saith to every man, I Who speak am near [4526] .' Right well is this
   word spoken, for He does not at one time speak, at another keep
   silence; but continually and at all times, from the beginning without

   ...In order that while He might become a sacrifice for us all, we,
   nourished up in the words of truth, and partaking of His living
   doctrine, might be able with the saints to receive also the joy of
   Heaven. For thither, as He called the disciples to the upper chamber,
   so does the Word call us with them to the divine and incorruptible
   banquet; having suffered for us here, but there, preparing the heavenly
   tabernacles for those who most readily hearken to the summons, and
   unceasingly, and [gazing] at the goal, pursue the prize of their high
   calling; where for them who come to the banquet, and strive with those
   who hinder them, there is laid up both a crown, and incorruptible joy.
   For even though, humanly speaking, the labour of such a journey is
   great, yet the Saviour Himself has rendered even it light and kindly.

   But let us, brethren, who have received the vineyard from the Saviour,
   and are invited to the heavenly banquet, inasmuch as the Feast is now
   drawing nigh, take the branches of the palm [4528] trees, and proving
   conquerors of sin, let us too like those, who on that occasion went to
   meet the Saviour, make ourselves ready by our conduct, both to meet Him
   when He comes, and to go in with Him and partake of the immortal food,
   and from thenceforth live eternally in the heavens.

   The Lord proved the disciples [4530] , when He was asleep on the
   pillow, at which time a miracle was wrought, which is especially
   calculated to put even the wicked to shame. For when He arose, and
   rebuked the sea, and silenced the storm, He plainly shewed two things;
   that the storm of the sea was not from the winds, but from fear of its
   Lord Who walked upon it, and that the Lord Who rebuked it was not a
   creature, but rather its Creator, since a creature is not obedient to
   another creature. For although the Red Sea was divided before by Moses
   [4531] , yet it was not Moses who did it, for it came to pass, not
   because he spoke, but because God commanded. And if the sun stood still
   in Gibeon [4532] , and the moon in the valley of Ajalon, yet this was
   the work, not of the son of Nun, but of the Lord, Who heard his prayer.
   He it was Who both rebuked the sea, and on the cross caused the sun to
   be darkened [4533] .

   Another Fragment [4535] .

   Here begins a letter of S. Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria, to his
   children. May God comfort you. I know moreover that not only this thing
   saddens you, but also the fact that while others have obtained the
   churches by violence, you are meanwhile cast out from your places. For
   they hold the places, but you the Apostolic Faith. They are, it is
   true, in the places, but outside of the true Faith; while you are
   outside the places indeed, but the Faith, within you. Let us consider
   whether is the greater, the place or the Faith. Clearly the true Faith.
   Who then has lost more, or who possesses more? He who holds the place,
   or he who holds the Faith? Good indeed is the place, when the Apostolic
   Faith is preached there, holy is it if the Holy One dwell there. (After
   a little:) But ye are blessed, who by faith are in the Church, dwell
   upon the foundations of the faith, and have full satisfaction, even the
   highest degree of faith which remains among you unshaken. For it has
   come down to you from Apostolic tradition, and frequently has accursed
   envy wished to unsettle it, but has not been able. On the contrary,
   they have rather been cut off by their attempts to do so. For this is
   it that is written, Thou art the Son of the Living God [4536] ,' Peter
   confessing it by revelation of the Father, and being told, Blessed art
   thou Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood did not reveal it to thee,' but
   My Father Who is in heaven,' and the rest. No one therefore will ever
   prevail against your Faith, most beloved brethren. For if ever God
   shall give back the churches (for we think He will) yet without [4537]
   such restoration of the churches the Faith is sufficient for us. And
   lest, speaking without the Scriptures, I should [seem to] speak too
   strongly, it is well to bring you to the testimony of Scriptures, for
   recollect that the Temple indeed was at Jerusalem; the Temple was not
   deserted, aliens had invaded it, whence also the Temple being at
   Jerusalem, those exiles went down to Babylon by the judgment of God,
   who was proving, or rather correcting them; while manifesting to them
   in their ignorance punishment [by means] of blood-thirsty enemies
   [4538] . And aliens indeed had held the Place, but knew not the Lord of
   the Place, while in that He neither gave answer nor spoke, they were
   deserted by the truth. What profit then is the Place to them?

   For behold they that hold the Place are charged by them that love God
   with making it a den of thieves, and with madly making the Holy Place a
   house of merchandise, and a house of judicial business for themselves
   to whom it was unlawful to enter there. For this and worse than this is
   what we have heard, most beloved, from those who are come from thence.
   However really, then, they seem to hold the church, so much the more
   truly are they cast out. And they think themselves to be within the
   truth, but are exiled, and in captivity, and [gain] no advantage by the
   church alone. For the truth of things is judged...

   [4535] The following fragment (Migne, ib. p. 1189), was published by
   Montfaucon from a Colbertine Latin ms. of about 800 a.d. He conjectured
   that it belonged to a Festal Letter. On this hypothesis, which is,
   however, as Mai observes, by no means self-evident, we append it to the
   above fragments of Letter 29, since internal evidence connects it with
   the handing over of the churches at Alexandria to the partisans of
   George, June, 356. At any rate, in spite of the heading of the
   fragment, its beginning is clearly not preserved.

     __________________________________________________________________

   From Letter XXXIX.--(For 367.) Of the particular books and their
   number, which are accepted by the Church. From the thirty-ninth Letter
   of Holy Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria, on the Paschal festival;
   wherein he defines canonically what are the divine books which are
   accepted by the Church.

   ...1. They have [4539] fabricated books which they call books of tables
   [4540] , in which they shew stars, to which they give the names of
   Saints. And therein of a truth they have inflicted on themselves a
   double reproach: those who have written such books, because they have
   perfected themselves in a lying and contemptible science; and as to the
   ignorant and simple, they have led them astray by evil thoughts
   concerning the right faith established in all truth and upright in the
   presence of God.

   ...2. But [4541] since we have made mention of heretics as dead, but of
   ourselves as possessing the Divine Scriptures for salvation; and since
   I fear lest, as Paul wrote to the Corinthians [4542] , some few of the
   simple should be beguiled from their simplicity and purity, by the
   subtilty of certain men, and should henceforth read other books--those
   called apocryphal--led astray by the similarity of their names with the
   true books; I beseech you to bear patiently, if I also write, by way of
   remembrance, of matters with which you are acquainted, influenced by
   the need and advantage of the Church.

   3. In proceeding to make mention of these things, I shall adopt, to
   commend my undertaking, the pattern of Luke the Evangelist, saying on
   my own account: Forasmuch as some have taken in hand [4543] ,' to
   reduce into order for themselves the books termed apocryphal, and to
   mix them up with the divinely inspired Scripture, concerning which we
   have been fully persuaded, as they who from the beginning were
   eyewitnesses and ministers of the Word, delivered to the fathers; it
   seemed good to me also, having been urged thereto by true brethren, and
   having learned from the beginning, to set before you the books included
   in the Canon, and handed down, and accredited as Divine; to the end
   that any one who has fallen into error may condemn those who have led
   him astray; and that he who has continued stedfast in purity may again
   rejoice, having these things brought to his remembrance.

   4. There are, then, of the Old Testament, twenty-two books in number;
   for, as I have heard, it is handed down that this is the number of the
   letters among the Hebrews; their respective order and names being as
   follows. The first is Genesis, then Exodus, next Leviticus, after that
   Numbers, and then Deuteronomy. Following these there is Joshua, the son
   of Nun, then Judges, then Ruth. And again, after these four books of
   Kings, the first and second being reckoned as one book, and so likewise
   the third and fourth as one book. And again, the first and second of
   the Chronicles are reckoned as one book. Again Ezra, the first and
   second [4544] are similarly one book. After these there is the book of
   Psalms, then the Proverbs, next Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs.
   Job follows, then the Prophets, the twelve being reckoned as one book.
   Then Isaiah, one book, then Jeremiah with Baruch, Lamentations, and
   [4545] the epistle, one book; afterwards, Ezekiel and Daniel, each one
   book. Thus far constitutes the Old Testament.

   5. Again it is not tedious to speak of the [books] of the New
   Testament. These are, the four Gospels, according to Matthew, Mark,
   Luke, and John. Afterwards, the Acts of the Apostles and Epistles
   (called Catholic), seven, viz. of James, one; of Peter, two; of John,
   three; after these, one of Jude. In addition, there are fourteen
   Epistles of Paul, written in this order. The first, to the Romans; then
   two to the Corinthians; after these, to the Galatians; next, to the
   Ephesians; then to the Philippians; then to the Colossians; after
   these, two to the Thessalonians, and that to the Hebrews; and again,
   two to Timothy; one to Titus; and lastly, that to Philemon. And
   besides, the Revelation of John.

   6. These are fountains of salvation, that they who thirst may be
   satisfied with the living words they contain. In these alone is
   proclaimed the doctrine of godliness. Let no man add to these, neither
   let him take ought from these. For concerning these the Lord put to
   shame the Sadducees, and said, Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures.'
   And He reproved the Jews, saying, Search the Scriptures, for these are
   they that testify of Me [4546] .'

   7. But for greater exactness I add this also, writing of necessity;
   that there are other books besides these not indeed included in the
   Canon, but appointed by the Fathers to be read by those who newly join
   us, and who wish for instruction in the word of godliness. The Wisdom
   of Solomon, and the Wisdom of Sirach, and Esther, and Judith, and
   Tobit, and that which is called the Teaching of the Apostles, and the
   Shepherd. But the former, my brethren, are included in the Canon, the
   latter being [merely] read; nor is there in any place a mention of
   apocryphal writings. But they are an invention of heretics, who write
   them when they choose, bestowing upon them their approbation, and
   assigning to them a date, that so, using them as ancient writings, they
   may find occasion to lead astray the simple.

   [4539] This section is preserved in the Coptic (Memphitic) Life of S.
   Theodore (AmÃ©lineau Ann. du MusÃ©e Guimet. xvii. p. 239). Its contents
   and the context in which it is quoted appear decisive for its
   identification as part of Letter 39. But the Letter from which the
   fragment comes is stated in the context to have been received by
   Theodore in the spring previous to his death. If Theodore died in 364,
   as seems probable on other grounds (see p. 569, note 3), the speech
   from which our fragment comes must have been written for him by his
   biographer. This is not unlikely, nor does it throw any suspicion on

   II. Personal Letters.

   Letter XLVI.--Letter [4563] to the Mareotis from Sardica, a.d. 343-4.

   Athanasius to the presbyters and deacons and the people of the Catholic
   Church in the Mareotis, brethren beloved and longed for, greeting in
   the Lord.

   The holy council has praised your piety in Christ. They have all
   acknowledged your spirit and fortitude in all things, in that ye did
   not fear threats, and though you had to bear insults and persecutions
   against your piety you held out. Your letters when read out to all
   produced tears and enlisted universal sympathy. They loved you though
   absent, and reckoned your persecutions as their own. Their letter to
   you is a proof of their affection: and although it would suffice to
   include you along with the holy Church of Alexandria [4564] , yet the
   holy synod has written separately to you in order that ye may be
   encouraged not to give way on account of your sufferings, but to give
   thanks to God; because your patience shall have good fruit.

   Formerly the character of the heretics was not evident. But now it is
   revealed and laid open to all. For the holy synod has taken cognisance
   of the calumnies these men have concocted against you, and has had them
   in abhorrence, and has deposed Theodore, Valens, Ursacius, in
   Alexandria [4565] and the Mareotis by consent of all. The same notice
   has been given to other Churches also. And since the cruelty and
   tyranny practised by them against the Churches can no longer be borne,
   they have been cast out from the episcopate and expelled from the
   communion of all. Moreover of Gregory they were unwilling even to make
   mention, for since the man has lacked the very name of bishop, they
   thought it superfluous to name him. But on account of those who are
   deceived by him they have mentioned his name; not because he seemed
   worthy of mention, but that those deceived by him might thereby
   recognise his infamy and blush at the kind of man with whom they have
   communicated. You will learn what has been written about them from the
   previous document [4566] : and though not all of the bishops came
   together to sign, yet it was drawn up by all, and they signed for all.
   Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the brethren salute you.

   I, Protogenes [4567] , bishop, desire that you may be preserved in the
   Lord, beloved and longed for.

   I, Athenodorus*, bishop, desire that ye may be preserved in the Lord,
   most beloved brethren. [Other signatures] Julian, Ammonius, Aprianus,
   Marcellus, Gerontius*, Porphyrius*, Zosimus, Asclepius, Appian,

   preserved in the Lord, beloved. We, Arcidamus and Philoxenus,
   presbyters, and Leo a deacon, from Rome, desire that ye may be
   preserved. I, Gaudentius, bishop of Naissus, desire that ye may be

   printed in Migne, xxvi. 1333, sqq., along with one (from the same
   source) addressed by the Council to the Mareotic Churches. Hefele
   doubts their genuineness, but without reason (ii. 166, E. Tra.) The
   list of signatures (an independent source of information, supr. p. 147)
   alone proves the contrary. The two letters may be taken as a supplement
   to the documents given, Apol. c. Ar. 37-50 (see also p. 147), with
   which they have many points of resemblance. The Latin is very bad and
   occasionally without sense; it bears clear traces of being a rendering

     __________________________________________________________________

   Letter XLVII.--To the Church of Alexandria on the same occasion.

   Athanasius to all the presbyters and deacons of the holy Catholic
   Church at Alexandria and the Parembola, brethren most beloved,
   greeting.

   In writing this I must begin my letter, most beloved brethren, by
   giving thanks to Christ. But now this is especially fitting, since both
   many things and great, done by the Lord, deserve our thanks [4576] ,
   and those who believe in Him ought not to be ungrateful for His many
   benefits. We thank the Lord therefore, who always manifests us to all
   in the faith, who also has at this time done many wonderful things for
   the Church. For what the heretical party of Eusebius and heirs of Arius
   have maintained and spread abroad, all the bishops who assembled have
   pronounced false and fictitious. And the very men who are thought
   terrible by many, like those who are called giants, were counted as
   nothing, and rightly so, for just as the darkness is illuminated when
   light comes, so, iniquity is unveiled by the coming of the just, and
   when the good are present, the worthless are exposed.

   For you yourselves, beloved, are not ignorant what the successors of
   the ill-named heresy of Eusebius did, namely Theodore, Narcissus,
   Valens, Ursacius, and the worst of them all, George, Stephen, Acacius,
   Menophantus, and their colleagues, for their madness is manifest to
   all; nor has it escaped your observation what they committed against
   the Churches. For you were the first they injured, your Church the
   first they tried to corrupt. But they who did so many great things, and
   were, as I said above, terrible to the minds of all, have been so
   frightened as to pass all imagination. For not only did they fear the
   Roman Synod, not only when invited to it did they excuse themselves,
   but, now also having arrived at Sardica, so conscience-stricken were
   they, that when they had seen the judges, they were astonished. So they
   fainted in their minds. Verily, one might say to them: Death, where is
   thy sting, Death, where is thy victory?' For neither did it go as they
   wished, for them to give judgment as they pleased; this time they could
   not over-reach whom they would. But they saw faithful men, that cared
   for justice, nay rather, they saw our Lord Himself among them, like the
   demons of old from the tombs; for being sons of falsehood, they could
   not bear to see the truth. So Theodore, Narcissus, and Ursacius, with
   their friends said as follows [4577] : Stay, what have we to do with
   you, men of Christ? We know that you are true, and fear to be
   convicted: we shrink from confessing our calumnies to your face. We
   have nothing to do with you; for you are Christians, while we are foes
   to Christ; and while with you truth is powerful, we have learned to
   over-reach. We thought our deeds were hid; we did not think that we
   were now coming to judgment; why do you expose our deeds before their
   time; and by exposing us vex us before the day?' and although they are
   of the worst character and walk in darkness, yet they have learnt at
   last that there is no agreement between light and darkness, and no
   concord between Christ and Belial. Accordingly, beloved brethren, since
   they knew what they had done, and saw their victims [4578] ready as
   accusers, and the witnesses before their eyes, they followed the
   example of Cain and fled like him; in that they greatly wandered [4579]
   , for they imitated his flight, and so have received his condemnation.
   For the holy council knows their works; it has heard our blood crying
   aloud, heard from themselves the voices of the wounded. All the Bishops
   know how they have sinned, and how many things they have done against
   our Churches and others; and accordingly they have expelled these men
   from the Churches like Cain. For who did not weep when your letter was
   read? who did not groan to see whom those men had exiled? Who did not
   reckon your tribulations his own? Most beloved brethren, you suffered
   formerly when they were committing evil against you, and perhaps it is
   no long time since the war has ceased. Now, however, all the Bishops
   who assembled and heard what you have suffered, grieved and lamented
   just as you did when you suffered the injuries and [4580] they shared
   your grief at that time....

   On account of these deeds then, and all the others which they have
   committed against the Churches, the holy general council has deposed
   them all, and not only has judged them aliens from the Church, but has
   held them unworthy to be called Christians. For how can men be called
   Christians who deny Christ? And how can men be admitted to church who
   do evil against the Churches? Accordingly, the holy council has sent to
   the Churches everywhere, that they may be marked among all, so that
   they who were deceived by them may now return to full assurance and
   truth. Do not therefore fail, beloved brethren; like servants of God,
   and professors of the faith of Christ, be tried in the Lord, and let
   not tribulation cast you down, neither let troubles caused by the
   heretics who plot against you make you sad. For you have the sympathy
   of the whole world in your grief, and what is more, it bears you all in
   mind. Now I think that those deceived by them will, when they see the
   severe sentence of the Council, turn aside from them and reject their
   impiety. If, however, even after this their hand is lifted up, do you
   not be astonished, nor fear if they rage; but pray and raise your hands
   to God, and be sure that the Lord will not tarry but will perform all
   things according to your will. I could wish indeed to write you a
   longer letter with a detailed account of what has taken place, but
   since the presbyters and deacons are competent to tell you in person of
   all they have seen, I have refrained from writing much. One thing alone
   I charge you, considering it a necessity, that having the fear of the
   Lord before your eyes you will put Him first, and carry on all things
   with your wonted concord as men of wisdom and understanding. Pray for
   us, bearing in mind the necessities of the widows [4581] , especially
   since the enemies of truth have taken away what belongs to them. But
   let your love overcome the malice of the heretics. For we believe that
   according to your prayers the Lord will be gracious and permit me to
   see you speedily. Meanwhile you will learn the proceedings at the Synod
   by what all the Bishops have written to you, and from the appended
   letter you will perceive the deposition of Theodore, Narcissus,
   Stephen, Acacius, George, Menophantus, Ursacius and Valens. For Gregory
   they did not wish to mention: since they thought it superfluous to name
   a man who lacked the very name of bishop. Yet for the sake of those
   deceived by him they have mentioned his name, not that his name was
   worthy of mention, but in order that those deceived by him may learn
   his infamy and blush for the sort of man they have communicated with
   [4582] ....I pray that you may be preserved in the Lord, brethren most
   beloved and longed for.

   Letter XLVIII.--Letter to Amun [4583] . Written before 354 a.d.

   All things made by God are beautiful and pure, for the Word of God has
   made nothing useless or impure. For we are a sweet savour of Christ in
   them that are being saved [4584] ,' as the Apostle says. But since the
   devil's darts are varied and subtle, and he contrives to trouble those
   who are of simpler mind, and tries to hinder the ordinary exercises of
   the brethren, scattering secretly among them thoughts of uncleanness
   and defilement; come let us briefly dispel the error of the evil one by
   the grace of the Saviour, and confirm the mind of the simple. For to
   the pure all things are pure,' but both the conscience and all that
   belongs to the unclean are defiled [4585] . I marvel also at the craft
   of the devil, in that, although he is corruption and mischief itself,
   he suggests thoughts under the show of purity; but with the result of a
   snare rather than a test. For with the object, as I said before, of
   distracting ascetics from their customary and salutary meditation, and
   of appearing to overcome them, he stirs some such buzzing thoughts as
   are of no profit in life, vain questions and frivolities which one
   ought to put aside. For tell me, beloved and most pious friend, what
   sin or uncleanness there is in any natural secretion,--as though a man
   were minded to make a culpable matter of the cleanings of the nose or
   the sputa from the mouth? And we may add also the secretions of the
   belly, such as are a physical necessity of animal life. Moreover if we
   believe man to be, as the divine Scriptures say, a work of God's hands,
   how could any defiled work proceed from a pure Power? and if, according
   to the divine Acts of the Apostles [4586] , we are God's offspring,' we
   have nothing unclean in ourselves. For then only do we incur
   defilement, when we commit sin, that foulest of things. But when any
   bodily excretion takes place independently of will, then we experience
   this, like other things, by a necessity of nature. But since those
   whose only pleasure is to gainsay what is said aright, or rather what
   is made by God, pervert even a saying in the Gospels, alleging that not
   that which goeth in defileth a man, but that which goeth out [4587] ,'
   we are obliged to make plain this unreasonableness,--for I cannot call
   it a question--of theirs. For firstly, like unstable persons, they
   wrest the Scriptures [4588] to their own ignorance. Now the sense of
   the divine oracle is as follows. Certain persons, like these of today,
   were in doubt about meats. The Lord Himself, to dispel their ignorance,
   or it may be to unveil their deceitfulness, lays down that, not what
   goes in defiles the man, but what goes out. Then he adds exactly whence
   they go out, namely from the heart. For there, as he knows, are the
   evil treasures of profane thoughts and other sins. But the Apostle
   teaches the same thing more concisely, saying, But meat shall not bring
   us before God [4589] .' Moreover, one might reasonably say no natural
   secretion will bring us before him for punishment. But possibly medical
   men (to put these people to shame even at the hands of outsiders) will
   support us on this point, telling us that there are certain necessary
   passages accorded to the animal body, to provide for the dismissal of
   the superfluity of what is secreted in our several parts; for example,
   for the superfluity of the head, the hair and the watery discharges
   from the head, and the purgings of the belly, and that superfluity
   again of the seminative channels. What sin then is there in God's name,
   elder most beloved of God, if the Master who made the body willed and
   made these parts to have such passages? But since we must grapple with
   the objections of evil persons, as they may say, If the organs have
   been severally fashioned by the Creator, then there is no sin in their
   genuine use,' let us stop them by asking this question: What do you
   mean by use? That lawful use which God permitted when He said, Increase
   and multiply, and replenish the earth [4590] ,' and which the Apostle
   approves in the words, Marriage is honourable and the bed undefiled
   [4591] ,' or that use which is public, yet carried on stealthily and in
   adulterous fashion? For in other matters also which go to make up life,
   we shall find differences according to circumstances. For example, it
   is not right to kill, yet in war it is lawful and praiseworthy to
   destroy the enemy; accordingly not only are they who have distinguished
   themselves in the field held worthy of great honours, but monuments are
   put up proclaiming their achievements. So that the same act is at one
   time and under some circumstances unlawful, while under others, and at
   the right time, it is lawful and permissible. The same reasoning
   applies to the relation of the sexes. He is blessed who, being freely
   yoked in his youth, naturally begets children. But if he uses nature
   licentiously, the punishment of which the Apostle [4592] writes shall
   await whoremongers and adulterers.

   For there are two ways in life, as touching these matters. The one the
   more moderate and ordinary, I mean marriage; the other angelic and
   unsurpassed, namely virginity. Now if a man choose the way of the
   world, namely marriage, he is not indeed to blame; yet he will not
   receive such great gifts as the other. For he will receive, since he
   too brings forth fruit, namely thirtyfold [4593] . But if a man embrace
   the holy and unearthly way, even though, as compared with the former,
   it be rugged and hard to accomplish, yet it has the more wonderful
   gifts: for it grows the perfect fruit, namely an hundredfold. So then
   their unclean and evil objections had their proper solution long since
   given in the divine Scriptures. Strengthen then, father, the flocks
   [4594] under you, exhorting them from the Apostolic writings, guiding
   them from the Evangelical, counselling them from the Psalms, and
   saying, quicken me according to Thy Word [4595] ;' but by Thy Word,' is
   meant that we should serve Him with a pure heart. For knowing this, the
   Prophet says, as if interpreting himself, Make me a clean heart, O God
   [4596] ,' lest filthy thoughts trouble me. David again, And stablish me
   with Thy free spirit [4597] ,' that even if ever thoughts disturb me, a
   certain strong power from Thee may stablish me, acting as a support.
   Giving then this and the like advice, say with regard to those who are
   slow to obey the truth, I will teach Thy ways unto the wicked,' and,
   confident in the Lord that you will persuade them to desist from such
   wickedness, sing and sinners shall be converted unto Thee [4598] .' And
   be it granted, that they who raise malicious questions may cease from
   such vain labour, and that they who doubt in their simplicity may be
   strengthened with a free spirit;' while as many of you as surely know
   the truth, hold it unbroken and unshaken in Christ Jesus our Lord, with
   whom be to the Father glory and might, together with the Holy Spirit,
   for ever and ever. Amen.

   Letter XLIX.--Letter to Dracontius [4599] . Written a.d. 354 or 355.

   I am at a loss how to write. Am I to blame you for your refusal? or for
   having regard to the trials, and hiding for fear of the Jews [4600] ?
   In any case, however it may be, what you have done is worthy of blame,
   beloved Dracontius. For it was not fitting that after receiving the
   grace you should hide, nor that, being a wise man, you should furnish
   others with a pretext for flight. For many are offended when they hear
   it; not merely that you have done this, but that you have done it
   having regard to the times and to the afflictions which are weighing
   upon the Church. And I fear lest, in flying for your own sake, you
   prove to be in peril in the sight of the Lord on account of others. For
   if he that offendeth one of the little ones, should rather choose that
   a mill stone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in
   the depths of the sea [4601] ,' what can be in store for you, if you
   prove an offence to so many? For the surprising unanimity about your
   election in the district [4602] of Alexandria will of necessity be
   broken up by your retirement: and the episcopate of the district will
   be grasped at by many,--and many unfit persons, as you are well aware.
   And many heathen who were promising to become Christians upon your
   election will remain heathen, if your piety sets at nought the grace
   given you.

   2. What defence will you offer for such conduct? With what arguments
   will you be able to wash away and efface such an impeachment? How will
   you heal those who on your account are fallen and offended? Or how will
   you be able to restore the broken peace? Beloved Dracontius, you have
   caused us grief instead of joy, groaning instead of consolation. For we
   expected to have you with us as a consolation; and now we behold you in
   flight, and that you will be convicted in judgment, and when upon your
   trial will repent it. And Who shall have pity upon thee [4603] ,' as
   the Prophet says, who will turn his mind to you for peace, when he sees
   the brethren for whom Christ died injured on account of your flight?
   For you must know, and not be in doubt, that while before your election
   you lived to yourself, after it, you live for your flock. And before
   you had received the grace of the episcopate, no one knew you; but
   after you became one, the laity expect you to bring them food, namely
   instruction from the Scriptures. When then they expect, and suffer
   hunger, and you are feeding yourself [4604] only, and our Lord Jesus
   Christ comes and we stand before Him, what defence will you offer when
   He sees His own sheep hungering? For had you not taken the money, He
   would not have blamed you. But He would reasonably do so if upon taking
   it you dug and buried it,--in the words which God forbid that your
   piety should ever hear: Thou oughtest to have given my money to the
   bankers, that when I came I might demand it of them [4605] .'

   3. I beseech you, spare yourself and us. Yourself, lest you run into
   peril; us, lest we be grieved because of you. Take thought of the
   Church, lest many of the little ones be injured on your account, and
   the others be given an occasion of withdrawing. Nay but if you feared
   the times and acted as you did from timidity, your mind is not manly;
   for in such a case you ought to manifest zeal for Christ, and rather
   meet circumstances boldly, and use the language of blessed Paul: in all
   these things we are more than conquerors [4606] ;' and the more so in
   that we ought to serve not the time, but the Lord [4607] . But if the
   organising of the Churches is distasteful to you, and you do not think
   the ministry of the episcopate has its reward, why, then you have
   brought yourself to despise the Saviour that ordered these things. I
   beseech you, dismiss such ideas, nor tolerate those who advise you in
   such a sense, for this is not worthy of Dracontius. For the order the
   Lord has established by the Apostles abides fair and firm; but the
   cowardice of the brethren shall cease [4608] .

   4. For if all were of the same mind as your present advisers, how would
   you have become a Christian, since there would be no bishops? Or if our
   successors are to inherit this state of mind, how will the Churches be
   able to hold together? Or do your advisers think that you have received
   nothing, that they despise it? If so surely they are wrong. For it is
   time for them to think that the grace of the Font is nothing, if some
   are found to despise it. But you have received it, beloved Dracontius;
   do not tolerate your advisers nor deceive yourself. For this will be
   required of you by the God who gave it. Have you not heard the Apostle
   say, Neglect not the gift that is in thee [4609] ?' or have you not
   read how he accepts the man that had doubled his money, while he
   condemned the one that had hidden it? But may it come to pass that you
   may quickly return, in order that you too may be one of those who are
   praised. Or tell me, whom do your advisers wish you to imitate? For we
   ought to walk by the standard of the saints and the fathers, and
   imitate them, and to be sure that if we depart from them we put
   ourselves also out of their fellowship. Whom then do they wish you to
   imitate? The one who hesitated, and while wishing to follow, delayed it
   and took counsel because of his family [4610] , or blessed Paul, who,
   the moment the stewardship was entrusted to him, straightway conferred
   not with flesh and blood [4611] ?' For although he said, I am not
   worthy to be called an Apostle [4612] ,' yet, knowing what he had
   received, and being not ignorant of the giver, he wrote, For woe is me
   if I preach not the gospel [4613] .' But, as it was woe to me' if he
   did not preach, so, in teaching and preaching the gospel, he had his
   converts as his joy and crown [4614] . This explains why the saint
   [4615] was zealous to preach as far as Illyricum, and not to shrink
   from proceeding to Rome [4616] , or even going as far as the Spains
   [4617] , in order that the more he laboured, he might receive so much
   the greater reward for his labour. He boasted then that he had fought
   the good fight, and was confident that he should receive the great
   crown [4618] . Therefore, beloved Dracontius, whom are you imitating in
   your present action? Paul, or men unlike him? For my part, I pray that
   you, and myself, may prove an imitator of all the saints.

   5. Or possibly there are some who advise you to hide, because you have
   given your word upon oath not to accept the office if elected. For I
   hear that they are buzzing in your ears to this effect, and consider
   that they are thus acting conscientiously. But if they were truly
   conscientious, they would above all have feared God, Who imposed this
   ministry upon you. Or if they had read the divine Scriptures, they
   would not have advised you contrary to them. For it is time for them to
   blame Jeremiah also, and to impeach the great Moses, in that they did
   not listen to their advice, but fearing God fulfilled their ministry,
   and prophesying were made perfect. For they also when they had received
   their mission and the grace of Prophecy, refused. But afterwards they
   feared, and did not set at nought Him that sent them. Whether then you
   be of stammering utterance, and slow of tongue, yet fear God that made
   you, or if you call yourself too young to preach, yet reverence Him Who
   knew you before you were made. Or if you have given your word (now
   their word was to the saints as an oath), yet read Jeremiah, how he too
   had said, I will not name the Name of the Lord [4619] ,' yet afterwards
   he feared the fire kindled within him, and did not do as he had said,
   nor hid himself as if bound by an oath, but reverenced Him that had
   entrusted to him his office, and fulfilled the prophetic call. Or are
   you not aware, beloved, that Jonah also fled, but met with the fate
   that befel him, after which he returned and prophesied?

   6. Do not then entertain counsels opposite to this. For the Lord knows
   our case better than we ourselves, and He knows to whom He is
   entrusting His Churches. For even if a man be not worthy, yet let him
   not look at his former life, but let him carry out his ministry, lest,
   in addition to his life he incur also the curse of negligence. I ask
   you, beloved Dracontius, whether knowing this, and being a wise man,
   you are not pricked in your soul? Do you not feel anxious lest any of
   those entrusted to you should perish? Do you not burn, as with a fire
   in your conscience? Are you not in fear of the day of judgment, in
   which none of your present advisers will be there to aid you? For each
   shall give account of those entrusted to his hands. For how did his
   excuse benefit the man who hid the money? Or how did it benefit Adam to
   say, The woman beguiled me [4620] ?' Beloved Dracontius, even if you
   are really weak, yet you ought to take up the charge, lest, the Church
   being unoccupied, the enemies injure it, taking advantage of your
   flight. You should gird yourself up, so as not to leave us alone in the
   struggle; you should labour with us, in order to receive the reward
   also along with all.

   7. Make haste then, beloved, and tarry no longer, nor suffer those who
   would prevent you: but remember Him that has given, and come hither to
   us who love you, who give you Scriptural advice, in order that you may
   both be installed by ourselves, and, as you minister in the churches
   make remembrance of us. For you are not the only one who has been
   elected from among monks, nor the only one to have presided over a
   monastery, or to have been beloved by monks. But you know that not only
   was Serapion a monk, and presided over that number of monks; you were
   not unaware of how many monks Apollos was father; you know Agathon, and
   are not ignorant of Ariston. You remember Ammonius who went abroad
   [4621] with Serapion. Perhaps you have also heard of Muitus [4622] in
   the upper Thebaid, and can learn about Paul [4623] at Latopolis, and
   many others. And yet these, when elected, did not gainsay; but taking
   Elisha as an example, and knowing the story of Elijah, and having
   learnt all about the disciples and apostles, they grappled with the
   charge, and did not despise the ministry, and were not inferior to
   themselves, but rather look for the reward of their labour, advancing
   themselves, and guiding others onward. For how many have they turned
   away from the idols? How many have they caused to cease from their
   familiarity with demons by their warning? How many servants have they
   brought to the Lord, so as to cause those who saw such wonders to
   marvel at the sight? Or is it not a great wonder to make a damsel live
   as a virgin, and a young man live in continence, and an idolater come
   to know Christ?

   8. Let not monks then prevent you, as though you alone had been elected
   from among monks; nor do you make excuses, to the effect that you will
   deteriorate. For you may even grow better if you imitate Paul, and
   follow up the actions of the Saints. For you know that men like those,
   when appointed stewards of the mysteries, all the more pressed forward
   to the mark of their high calling [4624] . When did Paul meet martyrdom
   and expect to receive his crown, if not after being sent to teach? When
   did Peter make his confession, if not when he was preaching the Gospel,
   and had become a fisher of men [4625] ? When was Elijah taken up, if
   not after completing his prophetic career? When did Elisha gain a
   double share of the Spirit, if not after leaving all to follow Elijah?
   Or why did the Saviour choose disciples, if not to send them out as
   apostles?

   9. So take these as an example, beloved Dracontius, and do not say, or
   believe those who say, that the bishop's office is an occasion of sin,
   nor that it gives rise to temptations to sin. For it is possible for
   you also as a bishop to hunger and thirst [4626] , as Paul did. You can
   drink no wine, like Timothy [4627] , and fast constantly too, like Paul
   [4628] , in order that thus fasting after his example you may feast
   others with your words, and while thirsting for lack of drink, water
   others by teaching. Let not your advisers, then, allege these things.
   For we know both bishops who fast, and monks who eat. We know bishops
   who drink no wine, as well as monks who do. We know bishops who work
   [4629] wonders, as well as monks who do not. Many also of the bishops
   have not even married, while monks have been [4630] fathers of
   children; just as conversely we know bishops who are fathers of
   children and monks of the completest kind [4631] .' And again, we know
   clergy who suffer hunger, and monks who fast. For it is possible in the
   latter way, and not forbidden in the former. But let a man, wherever he
   is, strive earnestly; for the crown is given not according to position,
   but according to action.

   10. Do not then suffer those who give contrary advice. But rather
   hasten and delay not; the more so as the holy festival is approaching;
   so that the laity may not keep the feast without you, and you bring
   great danger upon yourself. For who will in your absence preach them
   the Easter sermon? Who will announce to them the great day of the
   Resurrection, if you art in hiding? Who will counsel them, if you are
   in flight, to keep the feast fittingly? Ah, how many will be the better
   if you appear, how many be injured if you fly! And who will think well
   of you for this? and why do they advise you not to take up the bishop's
   office, when they themselves wish to have presbyters [4632] ? For if
   you are bad, let them not associate with you. But if they know that you
   are good, let them not envy the others. For if, as they say, teaching
   and government is an occasion of sin, let them not be taught
   themselves, nor have presbyters, lest they deteriorate, both they and
   those who teach them. But do not attend to these human sayings, nor
   suffer those who give such advice, as I have often already said. But
   rather make haste and turn to the Lord, in order that, taking thought
   for his sheep, you may remember us also. But to this end I have bidden
   our beloved Hierax, the presbyter, and Maximus the reader go, and bid
   you by word of mouth also, that you may be able thus to learn both with
   what feelings I have written, and the danger that results from
   gainsaying the ordinance of the Church.

   [4599] Dracontius, Bishop of Hermupolis Parva, was one of the bishops
   expelled from their sees, 356-7. His place of exile was the desert near
   Clysma,' i.e. the gulf of Suez (Hist. Ar. 75, cf. Hieron. Vit. Hilar.
   30). We find him in 362 at the Council of Alexandria. The present
   letter, written to urge Dracontius not to refuse the Episcopate, was
   written just before Easter (Â§10), when persecution was expected (Â§3),
   and after the mission of Serapion, Ammonius and others to Constantius,
   a.d. 353. It was probably written, therefore, early either in 354 or
   355. The letter is one of the masterpieces of Athanasius: its unforced
   warmth, vigour, and affection can fail to touch no one who reads it. It
   is, like the letter to Amun, one of our most important documents for
   the history of Egyptian Monasticism. (Migne xxv. 524 sqq.)

   merely his election.

   [4606] Rom. viii. 37.

   [4607] Rom. xii. 11, and Westcott and Hort on various reading.

   [4608] It should be observed that the fear of Dracontius was, not that
   he would suffer in dignity by becoming a bishop, but lest he should
   deteriorate spiritually (Â§8, init.). Cf. the dying soliloquy of Pope
   Eugenius IV.: Gabriele, hadst thou never been Pope nor Cardinal it had

   [4630] Probably the reference is to married men who had subsequently

   Letter L.--First Letter to Lucifer [4633] .

   To our lord, and most beloved brother the Bishop and Confessor Lucifer.
   Athanasius greeting in the Lord.

   Being well in body by God's favour, we have now sent our most beloved
   deacon Eutyches, that your most pious holiness, as is much desired by
   us, may be pleased to inform us of the safety of yourself and those
   with you. For we believe it is by the life of you Confessors and
   servants of God that the state of the Catholic Church is renewed; and
   that what heretics have assayed to rend in pieces, our Lord Jesus
   Christ by your means restores whole.

   For although the forerunners of Antichrist have by the power of this
   world done everything to put out the lantern of truth, yet the Deity by
   your confession shews its light all the clearer, so that none can fail
   to see their deceit. Heretofore perhaps they were able to dissimulate:
   now they are called Antichrists. For who can but execrate them, and fly
   from their communion like a taint, or the poison of a serpent? The
   whole Church everywhere is mourning, every city groans, aged bishops
   are suffering in exile, and heretics dissembling, who while denying
   Christ have made themselves publicans, sitting in the Churches and
   exacting revenue [4634] . O new kind of men and of persecution which
   the devil has devised, namely to use such cruelty, and even ministers
   as the agents of evil. But although they act thus, and have gone all
   lengths in pride and blasphemy, yet your confession, your piety and
   wisdom, will be the very greatest comfort and solace to the
   brotherhood. For it has been reported to us that your holiness has
   written to Constantius Augustus; and we wonder more and more that
   dwelling as it were among scorpions you yet preserve freedom of spirit,
   in order, by advice or teaching or correction, to bring those in error
   to the light of truth. I ask then, and all confessors join me in
   asking, that you will be good enough to send us a copy; so that all may
   perceive, not by hearsay only but by letters, the valour of your
   spirit, and the confidence and firmness of your faith. Those who are
   with me salute your holiness. I salute all those who are with you. May
   the deity ever keep you safe and sound and mindful of us, most beloved
   lord, and true man of God.

   Upon receiving this letter, blessed Lucifer sent the books which he had
   addressed to Constantius; and when he had read them Athanasius sent the
   following letter:
     __________________________________________________________________

   [4633] Lucifer, bishop of Calaris (Cagliari) in Sardinia, exiled by
   Constantius after the Council of Milan (Prolegg. ch. ii. Â§7), first to
   Germanicia, then to Eleutheropolis in Palestine, at both of which
   places he was subjected to harsh treatment, lastly to the Thebaid. The
   violence of his advocacy of the Nicene faith, coupled with extreme
   personal abusiveness, may have aggravated his sufferings. On his part
   in the events of 362, see Prolegg. ch. ii. Â§9. The present letters
   exist only in Latin (Migne xxvi. 1181), and are probably a translation
   from the Greek. Athan. may have known Latin, but there is no evidence
   that he ever wrote in that language. The play on the name Lucifer in
   Letter 51 proves nothing to the contrary. Dr. Bright (in D.C.B. i. 198,
   note) expresses a doubt as to the genuineness of our letters which is I
   think unsupported by internal evidence. The main difficulty is in the
   reconciliation of the apparent references (51 init.) to the events of
   356 as recent with the clear references to the de Athanasio and
   Moriendum pro Filio Dei of Lucifer, neither of which works were penned
   before 358, while the latter in its final form mentions the translation
   of Eudoxius to CP., and therefore falls as late as 360 (for proof of
   this, see KrÃ¼ger, Lucifer, pp. 102-109). But on close examination, the
   language of Letter 51 is satisfied by the events of 359, the vindictive
   commission of Paul Catena and the search for Athanasius among the
   Monasteries (cf. Letter 53, note 1). The respectful reference to
   Constantius in Letter 50 is of a purely formal character. The reference
   to the parents of Athanasius as still living is of great interest as
   one of the very few notices of the family of the great bishop (Prolegg.
   ch. ii. Â§1). The agitated tone of the Epistles reminds us of the Arian
   History, and they may be set down to about the year 359. On Lucifer,
   the monograph of KrÃ¼ger is the standard authority.

   Letter LI.--Second Letter to Lucifer.

   To the most glorious lord and deservedly much-desired fellow-Bishop
   Lucifer, Athanasius greeting in the Lord.

   Although I believe that tidings have reached your holiness also of the
   persecution which the enemies of Christ have just now attempted to
   raise, seeking our blood, yet our own most beloved messengers can tell
   your piety about it. For to such a length did they dare to carry their
   madness by means of the soldiers, that they not only banished the
   Clergy of the city, but also went out to the Hermits, and laid their
   fatal hands upon Solitaries. Hence I also withdrew far away, lest those
   who entertained me should suffer trouble at their hands. For whom do
   Arians spare, who have spared not even their own souls? Or how can they
   give up their infamous actions while they persist in denying Christ our
   Lord the only Son of God? This is the root of their wickedness; on this
   foundation of sand they build up the perversity of their ways, as we
   find it written in the thirteenth Psalm, The fool said in his heart
   there is no God;' and presently follows, Corrupt are they and become
   abominable in their works [4635] .' Hence the Jews who denied the Son
   of God, deserved to be called a sinful nation, a people laden with
   iniquity, a seed of evil doers, children without law [4636] .' Why
   without law?'--because you have deserted the Lord. And so the most
   blessed Paul, when he had begun not only to believe in the Son of God,
   but also to preach His deity, wrote, I know nothing against myself
   [4637] .' Accordingly we too, according to your confession of faith,
   desire to hold the Apostolic tradition, and to live according to the
   commands of the divine law, that we may be found along with you in that
   band in which now Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles and Martyrs are
   rejoicing. So then, though the Arian madness, aided by external power,
   was so active that our brethren on account of their fury could not even
   see the open air with freedom, yet by God's favour, according to your
   prayers, I have been able, though with trouble and danger, to see the
   brother who is wont to bring me necessaries and the letters of your
   holiness, along with those of others. And so we have received the books
   of your most wise and religious soul, in which we have seen the image
   of an Apostle, the confidence of a Prophet, the teaching of truth, the
   doctrine of true faith, the way of heaven, the glory of martyrdom, the
   triumphs against the Arian heresy, the unimpaired tradition of our
   Fathers, the right rule of the Church's order. O truly Lucifer, who
   according to your name bring the light of truth, and have set it on a
   candlestick to give light to all. For who, except the Arians, does not
   clearly see from your teaching the true faith and the taint of the
   Arians. Forcibly and admirably, like light from darkness, you have
   separated the truth from the subtilty and dishonesty of heretics,
   defended the Catholic Church, proved that the arguments of the Arians
   are nothing but a kind of hallucination, and taught that the diabolical
   gnashings of the teeth are to be despised. How good and welcome are
   your exhortations to martyrdom; how highly to be desired have you shewn
   death to be on behalf of Christ the Son of the living God [4638] . What
   love you have shewn for the world to come and for the heavenly life.
   You seem to be a true temple of the Saviour, Who dwells in you and
   utters these exact words through you, and has given such grace to your
   discourses. Beloved as you were before among all, now such passionate
   affection for you is settled in the minds of all, that they call you
   the Elijah of our times; and no wonder. For if they who seem to please
   God are called Sons of God, much more proper is it to give that name to
   the associates of the Prophets, namely the Confessors, and especially
   to you. Believe me, Lucifer, it is not you only who has uttered this,
   but the Holy Spirit with you. Whence comes so great a memory for the
   Scriptures? Whence an unimpaired sense and understanding of them?
   Whence has such an order of discourse been framed? Whence did you get
   such exhortations to the way of heaven, whence such confidence against
   the devil, and such proofs against heretics, unless the Holy Spirit had
   been lodged in you? Rejoice therefore to see that you are already there
   where also are your predecessors the martyrs, that is, among the band
   of angels. We also rejoice, having you as an example of valour, and
   patience, and liberty. For I blush to say anything of what you have
   written about my name [4639] , lest I should appear a flatterer. But I
   know and believe that the Lord Himself, Who has revealed all knowledge
   to your holy and religious spirit, will reward you for this labour also
   with a reward in the kingdom of the heavens. Since then you are such a
   man, we ask the Lord in prayer that you may pray for us, that in His
   mercy He may now deign to look down upon the Catholic Church, and
   deliver all His servants from the hands of persecutors; in order that
   all they too who have fallen on account of temporal fear may at length
   be enabled to raise themselves and return to the way of righteousness,
   led away from which they are wandering, poor people, not knowing in
   what a pit they are. In particular I ask, if I have said anything
   amiss, you would be good enough to overlook it, for from so great a
   fountain my unskilfulness has not been able to draw what it might have
   done. But as to our brethren, I ask you again to overlook my not having
   been able to see them. For truth itself is my witness that I wished and
   longed to compass this, and was greatly grieved at being unable. For my
   eyes ceased not from tears, nor my spirit from groaning, because we are
   not permitted even to see the brethren. But God is my witness, that on
   account of their persecution I have not been able to see even the
   parents whom I have [4640] . For what is there that the Arians leave
   undone? They watch the roads, observe those who enter and leave the
   city, search the vessels, go round the deserts, ransack houses, harass
   the brethren, cause unrest to everybody. But thanks be to God, in so
   doing they are more and more incurring the execration of all, and
   coming to be truly known for what your holiness has called them: slaves
   of Antichrist. And, poor wretches, hated as they are, they persist in
   their malice, until they shall be condemned to the death of their
   ancestor Pharaoh. Those with me salute your piety. Pray salute those
   who are with you. May God's divine grace preserve you, mindful of us
   and ever blessed, worthily called man of God, servant of Christ,
   partner of the Apostles, comfort of the brotherhood, master of truth,
   and in all things most longed for.

   Letter LII.--First Letter to Monks [4641] . (Written 358-360).

   1. To those in every place [4642] who are living a monastic life, who
   are established in the faith of God, and sanctified in Christ, and who
   say, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed Thee [4643] ,' brethren
   dearly beloved and longed for, heartiest greeting in the Lord.

   1. In compliance with your affectionate request, which you have
   frequently urged upon me, I have written a short account of the
   sufferings which ourselves and the Church have undergone, refuting,
   according to my ability, the accursed heresy of the Arian madmen, and
   proving how entirely it is alien from the Truth. And I thought it
   needful to represent to your Piety what pains the writing of these
   things has cost me, in order that you may understand thereby how truly
   the blessed Apostle has said, O the depth of the riches both of the
   wisdom and knowledge of God [4644] ;' and may kindly bear with a weak
   man such as I am by nature. For the more I desired to write, and
   endeavoured to force myself to understand the Divinity of the Word, so
   much the more did the knowledge thereof withdraw itself from me; and in
   proportion as I thought that I apprehended it, in so much I perceived
   myself to fail of doing so. Moreover also I was unable to express in
   writing even what I seemed to myself to understand; and that which I
   wrote was unequal to the imperfect shadow of the truth which existed in
   my conception.

   2. Considering therefore how it is written in the Book of Ecclesiastes,
   I said, I will be wise, but it was far from me; That which is far off,
   and exceeding deep, who shall find it out [4645] ?' and what is said in
   the Psalms, The knowledge of Thee is too wonderful for me; it is high,
   I cannot attain unto it [4646] ;' and that Solomon says, It is the
   glory of God to conceal a thing [4647] ;' I frequently designed to stop
   and to cease writing; believe me, I did. But lest I should be found to
   disappoint you, or by my silence to lead into impiety those who have
   made enquiry of you, and are given to disputation, I constrained myself
   to write briefly, what I have now sent [4648] to your piety. For
   although a perfect apprehension of the truth is at present far removed
   from us by reason of the infirmity of the flesh, yet it is possible, as
   the Preacher himself has said, to perceive the madness of the impious,
   and having found it, to say that it is more bitter than death [4649] .'
   Wherefore for this reason, as perceiving this and able to find it out,
   I have written, knowing that to the faithful the detection of impiety
   is a sufficient information wherein piety consists. For although it be
   impossible to comprehend what God is, yet it is possible to say what He
   is not [4650] . And we know that He is not as man; and that it is not
   lawful to conceive of any originated nature as existing in Him. So also
   respecting the Son of God, although we are by nature very far from
   being able to comprehend Him; yet is it possible and easy to condemn
   the assertions of the heretics concerning Him, and to say, that the Son
   of God is not such; nor is it lawful even to conceive in our minds such
   things as they speak, concerning His Godhead; much less to utter them
   with the lips.

   3. Accordingly I have written as well as I was able; and you, dearly
   beloved, receive these communications not as containing a perfect
   exposition of the Godhead of the Word, but as being merely a refutation
   of the impiety of the enemies of Christ, and as containing and
   affording to those who desire it, suggestions for arriving at a pious
   and sound faith in Christ. And if in anything they are defective (and I
   think they are defective in all respects), pardon it with a pure
   conscience, and only receive favourably the boldness of my good
   intentions in support of godliness. For an utter condemnation of the
   heresy of the Arians, it is sufficient for you to know the judgment
   given by the Lord in the death of Arius, of which you have already been
   informed by others. For what the Holy God hath purposed, who shall
   scatter [4651] ?' and whom the Lord condemned who shall justify [4652]
   ? After such a sign given, who do not now acknowledge, that the heresy
   is hated of God, however it may have men for its patrons? Now when you
   have read this account, pray for me, and exhort one another so to do.
   And immediately send it back to me, and suffer no one whatever to take
   a copy of it, nor transcribe it for yourselves [4653] . But like good
   money-changers [4654] be satisfied with the reading; but read it
   repeatedly if you desire to do so. For it is not safe that the writings
   of us babblers and private persons should fall into the hands of them
   that shall come after. Salute one another in love, and also all that
   come unto you in piety and faith. For if any man' as the Apostle has
   said, love not the Lord, let him be anathema. The grace of our Lord
   Jesus Christ be with you [4655] . Amen.'

   Letter LIII.--Second Letter [4656] to Monks.

   Athanasius, Archbishop [4657] of Alexandria, to the Solitaries.

   Athanasius to those who practise a solitary life, and are settled in
   faith in God, most beloved brethren, greeting in the Lord.

   I thank the Lord who hath given to you to believe in Him, that ye too
   may have with the saints eternal life. But because there are certain
   persons who hold with Arius and go about the monasteries with no other
   object save that under colour of visiting you, and returning from us
   they may deceive the simple; whereas there are certain who, while they
   affirm that they do not hold with Arius, yet compromise themselves and
   worship with his party; I have been compelled, at the instance of
   certain most sincere brethren, to write at once in order that keeping
   faithfully and without guile the pious faith which God's grace works in
   you, you may not give occasion of scandal to the brethren. For when any
   sees you, the faithful in Christ, associate and communicate with such
   people, [or worshipping along with them], certainly they will think it
   a matter of indifference and will fall into the mire of irreligion.
   Lest, then, this should happen, be pleased, beloved, to shun those who
   hold the impiety [of Arius], and moreover to avoid those who, while
   they pretend not to hold with Arius, yet worship with the impious. And
   we are specially bound to fly from the communion of men whose opinions
   we hold in execration. [If then any come to you, and, as blessed John
   [4658] says, brings with him right doctrine, say to him, All hail, and
   receive such an one as a brother.] But if any pretend that he confesses
   the right faith, but appear to communicate with those others, exhort
   him to abstain from such communion, and if he promise to do so, treat
   him as a brother, but if he persist in a contentious spirit, him avoid.
   [I might greatly lengthen my letter, adding from the divine Scriptures
   the outline of this teaching. But since, being wise men, you can
   anticipate those who write, and rather, being intent upon self-denial,
   are fit to instruct others also, I have dictated a short letter, as
   from one loving friend to others, in the confidence] that living as you
   do you will preserve a pure and sincere faith, and that those persons,
   seeing that you do not join with them in worship, will derive benefit,
   fearing lest they be accounted as impious, and as those who hold with
   them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [4656] This short letter, like those to Lucifer, was printed at first
   in Latin, evidently the almost servile rendering of a Greek original.
   The latter was discovered by Montfaucon after the completion of the
   Benedictine edition, and printed in his Nova Collectio Patrum' (1706).
   (Migne xxvi. 1185.) The date is fixed a parte post in an interesting
   manner. We read in the Life of Pachomius, Â§88 (the story is also found
   in the Coptic documents in the collection of Zoega p. 36), that when
   Duke Artemius came to the monastery of Pabau in search of Athanasius,
   the steward of the community replied, Although Athanasius is our Father
   under God, we have never seen his face.' The Duke answered by a request
   for the prayers of the brethren before he left. The abbat Psarphi'
   replied that the Father' had forbidden the monks to pray with strangers
   who consorted with the Arians,--a clear allusion to the letter before
   us. Now Duke Artemius was in search of Athanasius in 359-60 (Fest.
   Ind.). Accordingly our letter was issued before that date. The Greek
   text is evidently imperfect: the square brackets in the translation
   denote passages supplied from the Latin. The first part of the letter
   (down to the words along with'...) is preserved in a contemporary
   inscription (Boeckh. C.I.G. iv. 8607) on the walls of an ancient
   Egyptian tomb at Abd-el-Kurna, which in those later days had become a
   monastic cell. The remainder is effaced. (See Fialon, p. 134, who has
   failed to notice the identity of the inscription with our present
   letter.)

   [4657] This first heading is from the inscription mentioned above, note
   1, and is important as recording a very early use of the title
   archbishop.' See also Letter 55, note 1, supr. p. 137, note 6, and
   Epiph. vol. ii. p. 188 c (Migne).

     __________________________________________________________________

   Letter LIV.--To Serapion, concerning the death of Arius.

   Athanasius to Serapion [4659] , a brother and fellow-minister, health
   in the Lord.

   I have read the letters of your piety, in which you have requested me
   to make known to you the events of my times relating to myself, and to
   give an account of that most impious heresy of the Arians, in
   consequence of which I have endured these sufferings, and also of the
   manner of the death of Arius. With two out of your three demands I have
   readily undertaken to comply, and have sent to your Godliness what I
   wrote to the Monks; from which you will be able to learn my own history
   as well as that of the heresy. But with respect to the other matter, I
   mean the death, I debated with myself for a long time, fearing lest any
   one should suppose that I was exulting in the death of that man. But
   yet, since a disputation which has taken place amongst you concerning
   the heresy, has issued in this question, whether Arius died after
   previously communicating with the Church; I therefore was necessarily
   desirous of giving an account of his death, as thinking that the
   question would thus be set at rest, considering also that by making
   this known I should at the same time silence those who are fond of
   contention. For I conceive that when the wonderful circumstances
   connected with his death become known, even those who before questioned
   it will no longer venture to doubt that the Arian heresy is hateful in
   the sight of God.

   2. I was not at Constantinople when he died, but Macarius the Presbyter
   was, and I heard the account of it from him. Arius had been invited by
   the Emperor Constantine, through the interest of Eusebius and his
   fellows; and when he entered the presence the Emperor enquired of him,
   whether he held the Faith of the Catholic Church? And he declared upon
   oath that he held the right Faith, and gave in an account of his Faith
   in writing, suppressing the points for which he had been cast out of
   the Church by the Bishop Alexander, and speciously alleging expressions
   out of the Scriptures. When therefore he swore that he did not profess
   the opinions for which Alexander had excommunicated him, [the Emperor]
   dismissed him, saying [4660] , If thy Faith be right, thou hast done
   well to swear; but if thy Faith be impious, and thou hast sworn, God
   judge of thee according to thy oath.' When he thus came forth from the
   presence of the Emperor, Eusebius and his fellows, with their
   accustomed violence, desired to bring him into the Church. But
   Alexander, the Bishop of Constantinople of blessed memory, resisted
   them, saying that the inventor of the heresy ought not to be admitted
   to communion; whereupon Eusebius and his fellows threatened, declaring,
   As we have caused him to be invited by the Emperor, in opposition to
   your wishes, so to-morrow, though it be contrary to your desire, Arius
   shall have communion with us in this Church.' It was the Sabbath when
   they said this.

   3. When the Bishop Alexander heard this, he was greatly distressed, and
   entering into the church, he stretched forth his hands unto God, and
   bewailed himself; and casting himself upon his face in the chancel, he
   prayed, lying upon the pavement. Macarius also was present, and prayed
   with him, and heard his words. And he besought these two things,
   saying, If Arius is brought to communion to-morrow, let me Thy servant
   depart, and destroy not the pious with the impious; but if Thou wilt
   spare Thy Church (and I know that Thou wilt spare), look upon the words
   of Eusebius and his fellows, and give not thine inheritance to
   destruction and reproach [4661] , and take off Arius, lest if he enter
   into the Church, the heresy also may seem to enter with him, and
   henceforward impiety be accounted for piety.' When the Bishop had thus
   prayed, he retired in great anxiety; and a wonderful and extraordinary
   circumstance took place. While Eusebius and his fellows threatened, the
   Bishop prayed; but Arius, who had great confidence in Eusebius and his
   fellows, and talked very wildly, urged by the necessities of nature
   withdrew, and suddenly, in the language of Scripture, falling headlong
   he burst asunder in the midst [4662] ,' and immediately expired as he
   lay, and was deprived both of communion and of his life together.

   4. Such has been the end of Arius: and Eusebius and his fellows,
   overwhelmed with shame, buried their accomplice, while the blessed
   Alexander, amidst the rejoicings of the Church, celebrated the
   Communion with piety and orthodoxy, praying with all the brethren, and
   greatly glorifying God, not as exulting in his death (God forbid!), for
   it is appointed unto all men once to die [4663] ,' but because this
   thing had been shewn forth in a manner transcending human judgments.
   For the Lord Himself judging between the threats of Eusebius and his
   fellows, and the prayer of Alexander, condemned the Arian heresy,
   shewing it to be unworthy of communion with the Church, and making
   manifest to all, that although it receive the support of the Emperor
   and of all mankind, yet it was condemned by the Church herself. So the
   antichristian gang of the Arian madmen has been shewn to be unpleasing
   to God and impious; and many of those who before were deceived by it
   changed their opinions. For none other than the Lord Himself who was
   blasphemed by them condemned the heresy which rose up against Him, and
   again shewed that howsoever the Emperor Constantius may now use
   violence to the Bishops in behalf of it, yet it is excluded from the
   communion of the Church, and alien from the kingdom of heaven.
   Wherefore also let the question which has arisen among you be
   henceforth set at rest; (for this was the agreement made among you),
   and let no one join himself to the heresy, but let even those who have
   been deceived repent. For who shall receive what the Lord condemned?
   And will not he who takes up the support of that which He has made
   excommunicate, be guilty of great impiety, and manifestly an enemy of
   Christ?

   5. Now this is sufficient to confound the contentious; read it
   therefore to those who before raised this question, as well as what was
   briefly addressed to the Monks against the heresy, in order that they
   may be led thereby more strongly to condemn the impiety and wickedness
   of the Arian madmen. Do not however consent to give a copy of these to
   any one, neither transcribe them for yourself (I have signified the
   same to the Monks also); but as a sincere friend, if anything is
   wanting in what I have written, add it, and immediately send them back
   to me. For you will be able to learn from the letter which I have
   written to the Brethren, what pains it has cost me to write it, and
   also to perceive that it is not safe for the writings of a private
   person to be published (especially if they relate to the highest and
   chief doctrines), for this reason;--lest what is imperfectly expressed
   through infirmity or the obscurity of language, do hurt to the reader.
   For the majority of men do not consider the faith, or the aim of the
   writer, but either through envy or a spirit of contention, receive what
   is written as themselves choose, according to an opinion which they
   have previously formed, and misinterpret it to suit their pleasure. But
   the Lord grant that the Truth and a sound [4664] faith in our Lord
   Jesus Christ may prevail among all, and especially among those to whom
   you read this. Amen.

   [4659] On this letter (Migne xxv. 686) in relation to other writings,
   see above, Letter 52, note 1, and pp. 267, 268. Serapion would seem to
   have been the right-hand man of Athan. among the bishops of Egypt. The
   dates of his birth and episcopate are not certain, but the tone of the
   letters to him imply that he is junior to Athanasius. The theory of
   Ceillier, based on a precarious inference from the words of an
   untrustworthy writer (Philip of Side) that this Serapion (the name was
   very common) had presided over the catechetical school before Peter,
   i.e. at the end of the third century, is quite out of the question.
   Moreover, no Serapion appears among the Egyptian bishops at Tyre in 335
   (p. 142), but the name occurs among the Alexandrian presbyterate of the
   same date (pp. 139, 140), while two bishops of the name sign the
   Sardican decrees (p. 127). It is then not unlikely that Athan. selected
   Serapion for the very important (Amm. Marc. xxii. 16) see of Thmuis in
   the Delta between 337 and 339 (supr. Letter 12, note 1). In 353 the
   trusted suffragan is chosen for a difficult and perilous mission to
   Constantius (supr. pp. 497, 504). For some reason we miss his name from
   the list of exiles in 356-7 (pp. 257, 297), nor is he named as present
   at the Council of Confessors' in 362. During the third exile, however,
   Ath. addressed to him our present letter, and an important dogmatic
   treatise (Prolegg. ch. iii. Â§1, no. 22). Serapion was a friend and
   legatee of S. Antony (supr. p. 220). The date of Serapion's death is
   not known, but he is said to have been living after 368 (Leont. adv.
   fraud. Apoll. in Galland. xii. 701, see Bright, Later Treat. p. 44).
   For further details, and for writings ascribed to him, see D.C.B. iv.

   Letter LV.--Letter to Rufinianus.

   To our lord, son, and most desired fellow-minister Rufinianus [4665] .
   Athanasius greeting in the Lord.

   You write what is proper for a beloved son to write to a father:
   accordingly, I embraced you when you came near me in writing, most
   desired Rufinianus. And I, though I might write to you as a son both in
   the opening and the middle and the close, refrained, lest my
   commendation and testimony should be made known by writing. For you are
   my letter, as it is written [4666] , known and read in the heart. That
   you then are in such case, believe, yea believe. I address you, and
   invite you to write. For by doing so you afford me the highest
   gratification. But since in an honourable and church-like spirit, such
   as becomes your piety, you ask me about those who were drawn away by
   necessity but not corrupted by error, and wish me to write what
   resolution has been come to about them, whether in synods or elsewhere;
   know, most desired Lord, that to begin with [4667] , when violence was
   ceased, a synod [4668] has been held, bishops from foreign parts being
   present; while others have been held by our fellow-ministers resident
   in Greece, as well as by those in Spain and Gaul [4669] : and the same
   decision was come to here and everywhere, namely, in the case of those
   who had fallen and been leaders of impiety, to pardon them upon their
   repentance, but not to give them the position of clergy: but in the
   case of men not deliberate in impiety, but drawn away by necessity and
   violence, that they should not only receive pardon, but should occupy
   the position of clergy: the more so, in that they offered a plausible
   defence, and what had happened seemed due to a certain special purpose
   [4670] . For they assured us that they had not gone over to impiety;
   but lest certain most impious persons should be elected and ruin the
   Churches they elected rather to acquiesce in the violence and to bear
   the burden, than to lose the people. But in saying this, they appeared
   to us to say what was plausible; for they alleged in excuse Aaron the
   brother of Moses, who in the wilderness acquiesced in the people's
   transgression; and that he had had as his excuse the danger of the
   people returning to Egypt and abiding in idolatry. For there was reason
   in the view, that if they remained in the wilderness they might cease
   from their impiety: but if they went into Egypt they would become
   ruined and increase the impiety in their midst. For this reason, then,
   they have been allowed to rank as clergy, those who had been deceived
   and suffered violence being pardoned. I give this information to your
   piety in the confidence that you will both accept [4671] what has been
   resolved upon, and not charge those who assembled, as I have said, with
   remissness. But be good enough to read it to the clergy and laity under
   you, that they may be informed, and may not blame you for being thus
   minded about such persons. For it would not be fitting for me to write,
   when your piety is able to do so, and to announce our mind with regard
   to them, and carry out all that remains to be done. Thanks to the Lord
   that filled you [4672] with all utterance and with all knowledge. Let
   then those that repent openly anathematise by name the error of
   Eudoxius and Euzoius. For they blasphemed still, and wrote that He was
   a creature, ringleaders of the Arian heresy. But let them confess the
   faith confessed by the fathers at NicÃ¦a, and that they put no other
   synod before that one. Greet the brotherhood with you. That with us
   greets you in the Lord.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [4665] This letter (Migne xxvi. 1180) deals with one of the questions
   which occupied the council of 362 (supr. p. 481), and was probably
   written not long after, although the contents furnish no precise
   terminus ad quem. The personality and see of Rufinianus are uncertain.
   The latter must have been distant from Alexandria: the Coptic documents
   call him Rufinus the archbishop,' which seems to place him outside
   Egypt. The mention of Eudoxius and Euzoius sub. fin. possibly points to
   Syria. I suspect that he is the Lucinianus' associated with Eusebius'
   (of VercellÃ¦?) in the little fragment (4) quoted in note 7 below, which
   comes from a letter of Ath. dealing with the same subject. The Coptic
   Acts' of Revillout, p. 462 (as referred to supr. p. 188) give part of a
   letter of Rufinianus himself, which shews that the correspondence of
   which our letter is the principal relic bore on the Christological
   decision of the Council of 362: Sound is the idea of perfection for the
   Divinity, as for the Economy of the Manhood: Sound is the doctrine of
   the Divinity in a single essence. Pure, and wholesome for the souls of
   the faithful, is the Confession of the Holy Triad. Perfect then is the
   Economy of the Manhood of the Saviour, and Perfect is His Soul also;
   nothing is lacking to Him. It is thus that It was manifested to us.'

   [4669] These unnamed councils are all connected with the general return

   the same as are referred to again in the opening of the letter to
   Epict. below, p. 570.

   Letter LVI.--To the Emperor Jovian.

   Copy of a letter of the Emperor Jovian, sent to Athanasius, the most
   holy Archbishop of Alexandria.

   To the most religious and friend of God, Athanasius, Jovian.

   Admiring exceedingly the achievements of your most honourable life, and
   of your likeness to the God of all, and of your affection toward our
   Saviour Christ, we accept you, most honoured bishop. And inasmuch as
   you have not flinched from all labour, nor from the fear of your
   persecutors, and, regarding dangers and threats of the sword as dung,
   holding the rudder of the orthodox faith which is dear to you, are
   contending even until now for the truth, and continue to exhibit
   yourself as a pattern to all the people of the faithful, and an example
   of virtue:--our imperial Majesty recalls you, and desires that you
   should return to the office of the teaching of salvation. Return then
   to the holy Churches, and tend the people of God, and send up to God
   with zeal your prayers for our clemency. For we know that by your
   supplication we, and all who hold with us [the Christian faith], shall
   have great assistance from the supreme God.

   56. Letter of Athanasius to Jovian [4673] concerning the Faith.

   1. A desire to learn and a yearning for heavenly things is suitable to
   a religious Emperor; for thus you will truly have your heart' also in
   the hand of God [4674] .' Since then your Piety desired [4675] to learn
   from us the faith of the Catholic Church, giving thanks for these
   things to the Lord, we counselled above all things to remind your Piety
   of the faith confessed by the Fathers at NicÃ¦a. For this certain set at
   nought, while plotting against us in many ways, because we would not
   comply with the Arian heresy, and they have become authors of heresy
   and schisms in the Catholic Church. For the true and pious faith in the
   Lord has become manifest to all, being both known and read [4676] '
   from the Divine Scriptures. For in it both the saints were made perfect
   and suffered martyrdom, and now are departed in the Lord; and the faith
   would have abode inviolate always had not the wickedness of certain
   heretics presumed to tamper with it. For a certain Arius and those with
   him attempted to corrupt it, and to introduce impiety in its place,
   affirming that the Son of God was from nought, and a creature, and a
   thing made and changeable. But with these words they deceived many, so
   that even they that seemed to be somewhat were carried away [4677] ,'
   with their blasphemy. And yet our holy Fathers, as we said before, came
   promptly together at the Synod at NicÃ¦a, and anathematised them, and
   confessed in writing the faith of the Catholic Church, so that, this
   being everywhere preached, the heresy kindled by the heretics might be
   quenched. This faith then was everywhere in every Church sincerely
   known and preached. But since now certain who wish to renew the Arian
   heresy have presumed to set at nought this faith confessed at NicÃ¦a by
   the Fathers, and while pretending to confess it, do in fact deny it,
   explaining away the Coessential [4678] ,' and blaspheming of their own
   accord [4679] against the Holy Spirit, in affirming that It is a
   creature, and came into being as a thing made by the Son, we hasten as
   of bounden duty, in view of the injury resulting to the people from
   such blasphemy, to hand to your Piety the faith confessed at NicÃ¦a; in
   order that thy religiousness may know what has been written with all
   accuracy, and how far wrong they are who teach contrary to it.

   2. For know, most religious Augustus, that these things have been
   preached from time immemorial, and this faith the Fathers who met at
   NicÃ¦a confessed; and to it have assented all the Churches in every
   quarter, both those in Spain, and Britain, and the Gauls, and all Italy
   and Dalmatia, Dacia and Moesia, Macedonia and all Greece, and in all
   Africa and Sardinia, and Cyprus and Crete, as well as Pamphylia, Lycia
   and Isauria, and those in Egypt and the Libyas, Pontus and Cappadocia,
   and those near at hand to us [4680] , and the Churches in the East,
   except a few who hold with Arius. For of all those above mentioned we
   have both learnt the opinion by experience, and we have letters. And
   you know, O most religious Augustus, that even if some few speak
   against this faith, they cannot create a demurrer [4681] , inasmuch as
   the whole world [4682] holds the Apostolic faith. For they having long
   been infected by the Arian heresy, now the more obstinately oppose the
   truth. And that your Piety may know, although you know already, yet we
   hasten to append the faith confessed by the Bishops at NicÃ¦a. The faith
   then confessed at NicÃ¦a by the Fathers is as follows:--

   3. We believe [4683] , &c., &c.

   4. By this faith, Augustus, all must needs abide, as Divine and
   Apostolic, and none must unsettle it by plausibilities, and contentions
   about words, which is what the Arian madmen have done, saying that the
   Son of God is from nought, and that once there was when He was not, and
   that He is created, and made and changeable. For for this cause, as we
   said before, the Synod at NicÃ¦a anathematised such heresy, but
   confessed the faith of the truth. For they have not merely said that
   the Son is like [4684] the Father, lest He should be believed merely
   like God, instead of Very God from God; but they wrote Coessential,'
   which was peculiar to a genuine and true Son, truly and naturally from
   the Father. Nor yet did they make the Holy Spirit alien from the Father
   and the Son, but rather glorified Him together with the Father and the
   Son, in the one faith of the Holy Triad, because there is in the Holy
   Triad also one Godhead.

   Appendix to Letter LVI.

   Petition made at Antioch to Jovian the Emperor on the part of Lucius
   [4685] and Bernicianus, and certain other Arians against Athanasius,
   Bishop of Alexandria.

   First Petition which they made as the Emperor was departing to Camp, at
   the Roman Gate.

   May it please your Might and your Majesty and your Piety to hear us.
   The Emperor: Who are you and where from?' The Arians: Christians, my
   Lord.' Emperor: Where from, and from what city?' The Arians:
   Alexandria.'--Emperor: What do you want?' The Arians: May it please
   your Might and your Majesty, give us a Bishop.' Emperor: I ordered the
   former one, whom you had before, Athanasius, to occupy the See.' The
   Arians: May it please your Might: he has been many years both in
   banishment, and under accusation.' Suddenly a soldier answered in
   indignation: May it please your Majesty, enquire of them who they are
   and where from, for these are the leavings and refuse of Cappadocia,
   the remains of that unholy George who desolated the city and the
   world.' The Emperor on hearing this set spurs to his horse, and
   departed to the Camp.

   Second Petition of the Arians.

   We have accusations and clear proofs against Athanasius, in that ten
   and twenty years ago he was deprived by the ever memorable Constantine
   and Constantius, and incurred banishment under the most religious and
   philosophical and blessed Julian.' Emperor: Accusations ten, twenty,
   and thirty years old are now obsolete. Don't speak to me about
   Athanasius, for I know why he was accused, and how he was banished.'

   Third Petition of the Arians.

   And now again, we have certain other accusations against Athanasius.'
   Emperor: The rights of the case will not appear by means of crowded
   numbers, and clamours, but choose two from yourselves, and from the
   party of the majority other two, for I cannot answer each one
   severally.' Those from the majority: These are the leavings from the
   unholy George, who desolated our province, and who would not allow a
   counsellor to dwell in the cities.' The Arians: May it please you, any
   one you will except Athanasius.' Emperor: I told you that the case of
   Athanasius was already settled,' (and then angrily) feri, feri [4686]
   !' The Arians: May it please you, if you send Athanasius, our city is
   ruined, and no one assembles with him.' Emperor: Yet I took pains, and
   ascertained that he holds right opinions and is orthodox, and teaches
   aright.' The Arians: With his mouth he utters what is right, but in his
   soul he harbours guile.' Emperor: That will do, you have testified of
   him, that he utters what is right and teaches aright, but if he teaches
   and speaks aright with his tongue, but harbours evil thoughts in his
   soul, it concerns him before God. For we are men, and hear what is
   said; but what is in the heart God knows.' The Arians: Authorise our
   holding communion together.' Emperor: Why, who prevents you?' The
   Arians: May it please you, he proclaims us as sectarians and
   dogmatisers.' Emperor: It is his duty, and that of those who teach
   aright.' The Arians: May it please your Might; we cannot bear this man,
   and he has taken away the lands of the Churches.' Emperor: Oh then, it
   is on account of property you are come here, and not on account of the
   faith'--then he added--go away, and keep the peace.' Once more he added
   to the Arians: Go away to the Church, to-morrow you have a Communion,
   and after the dismissal, there are Bishops here, and here is Nemesinus
   [4687] , each one of you shall sign as he believes: Athanasius is here
   too; whoever does not know the word of faith, let him learn from
   Athanasius. You have to-morrow and the day after, for I am going out to
   Camp.' And a certain lawyer [4688] belonging to the Cynics petitioned
   the Emperor: May it please your Majesty, on account of Bishop
   Athanasius, the Receiver-General [4689] seized my houses.' Emperor: If
   the Receiver-General seized your houses what has that to do with
   Athanasius?' Another lawyer, Patalas, said: I have a complaint against
   Athanasius.' Emperor: And what have you to do with Christians, being a
   heathen?' But certain of the majority of them of Antioch took Lucius
   and brought him to the Emperor, saying: May it please your Might and
   your Majesty, look whom they wanted to make a Bishop!'

   Another petition made at the porch of the palace [4690] on the part of
   Lucius:--May it please your Might, listen to me.' The Emperor stopped
   and said: I ask you, Lucius, how did you come here, by sea or by land?'
   Lucius: May it please you, by sea.' Emperor: Well, Lucius, may the God
   of the world, and the radiant sun, and moon, be angry with those men
   that made the voyage with you, for not casting you into the sea; and
   may that ship never again have fair winds, nor find a haven with her
   passengers when in a storm.' And through Euzoius [4691] the unbelieving
   Arians asked Probatius and his fellows, the successors of Eusebius
   [4692] and Bardio as eunuchs, that they might be granted an audience.
   The Emperor learned this, and tortured the eunuchs and said: If any one
   wants to make a petition against Christians let this be his fate.' And
   so the Emperor dismissed them.

   Athanasius, on the first news of Julian's death, by a secret and rapid
   journey, succeeded in meeting Jovian, when still beyond the Euphrates
   on his return from the East. He thus secured the ear of the new Emperor
   before the Arian deputation from Alexandria could reach him. The letter
   before us (Migne xxvi. 813) was drawn up at Antioch, as it would seem
   in response to a request from Jovian on a doctrinal statement. The
   short letter of Jovian prefixed to the Epistle is a formal
   authorisation for the bishop's return to his see, with which, taught by
   his experience under Julian, he was careful to arm himself. The
   documents given as an appendix are notes made at Antioch, and carefully
   preserved, of the reception given by Jovian to the Arian deputation.
   They are probably the exemplaria' referred to in Hist. Aceph. Â§14 (see
   note there). They are characteristic, and interesting in many ways;
   among others, as shewing how accurately Jovian had been primed by
   Athanasius with the leading facts of his case.

   Letter LVII.--First Letter to Orsisius [4693] .

   And having spent a few days there, he saith to the Abbat Theodorus:
   Since the Passover is nigh, visit the brethren after your manner; and
   as the Lord shall dispose me, I will do. And he embraced him, and sent
   him away, having written a letter by him to the Abbat Orsisius and the
   brethren, to the following effect:'--

   I have seen your fellow-worker and father of the brethren, Theodorus,
   and in him the master of our father Pachomius. And I rejoiced to see
   the sons of the Church, and they made me glad by their presence. But
   the Lord is their recompenser. And as Theodorus was about to leave me
   for you, he said to me: Remember me. And I said to him: If I forget
   thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand be forgotten, yea let my tongue
   cleave to my throat if I remember thee not [4694] .
     __________________________________________________________________

   [4693] Orsisius was chosen abbat of Tabenne in Upper Egypt, a.d. 347,
   in succession to Petronius. Presently, however, he resigned in favour
   of Theodorus, the favourite disciple of Pachomius. The two letters
   which follow are from the life of Pachomius, Â§Â§92, 96, Acta SS. for
   May, vol. iii. (Also in Migne xxvi. 977.) They belong, the first to the
   year 363 a.d., not long before the death of Julian (D.C.B. i. 199a),
   the second to the summer of the following year, 364 (infr. note 3).
   Both letters are characteristic; the second a moving and simple
   consolation to mourners.

   Letter LVIII.--Second Letter to Orsisius.

   But the most holy Archbishop Athanasius, when he heard about our father
   Theodorus, was grieved, and sent this letter to the Abbat Orsisius and
   the brethren to console them for his decease, as follows:'--

   Athanasius to Orsisius, Abbat, father of monks, and to all with him who
   practise the solitary life, and are settled in faith in God, beloved
   brethren most longed for in the Lord, greeting.

   I have heard about the decease of the blessed Theodorus [4695] , and
   the tidings caused me great anxiety, knowing as I did his value to you.
   Now if it had not been Theodorus, I should have used many words to you,
   with tears, considering what follows after death. But since it is
   Theodorus whom you and I have known, what need I say in my letter save
   Blessed is' Theodorus, who hath not walked in the council of the
   ungodly [4696] ?' But if he is blessed that feareth the Lord [4697] ,'
   we may now confidently call him blessed, having the firm assurance that
   he has reached as it were a haven, and has a life without care. Would
   that the same had also befallen each one of us; would that each of us
   in his running might thus arrive; would that each of us, on his voyage,
   might moor his own bark there in the stormless haven, so that, at rest
   with the fathers, he might say, here will I dwell, for I have a delight
   therein [4698] .' Wherefore, brethren beloved and most longed-for, weep
   not for Theodorus, for he is not dead, but sleepeth [4699] .' Let none
   weep when he remembers him, but imitate his life. For one must not
   grieve over one that is gone to the place where grief is not. This I
   write to you all in common; but especially to you, beloved and most
   longed for Orsisius, in order that now that he is fallen asleep, you
   may take up the whole charge, and take his place among the brethren.
   For while he survived, you two were as one, and when one was away, the
   work of both was carried on: and when both were there you were as one,
   discoursing to the beloved ones what made for their good. Thus act,
   then, and so doing write and tell me of the safety of yourself and of
   the brotherhood. And I exhort you all to pray together that the Lord
   may grant further peace to the Churches. For we now kept festival with
   joy, both Easter and Pentecost, and we rejoice in the benefits of the
   Lord. I write to you all. Greet all who fear the Lord. Those with me
   greet you. I pray that you may be well in the Lord, beloved and
   much-longed-for brethren.

   [4695] On Theodore see Amelineau, S. PakhÃ´me, &c., pp. xcv.-xcvii. The
   death of Theodore is fixed for April 27, 364, on the following grounds.
   He died (Vit. Pachom. 95) of a short and sudden illness, on Pachon 2
   (April 27), and shortly after Easter. Moreover his death took place 18
   years after that of Pachomius. But Ammon (as he tells us himself, supr.
   p. 487) became a Christian and a monk a year and more' after March 15,
   351 (proclamation of Gallus as CÃ¦sar), and six years after the death of
   Pachomius. (Ep. Amm. 4, 5.) This dates the latter event a little less
   than five years before March 15, 351. But Pachomius died, according to
   his Life, on Pachon 14 (May 9), of an epidemic which attacked the
   community after Easter. This double condition is satisfied by the year
   346, in which Easter fell on Pharm. 4, forty days before the day of
   Pachomius' decease. If then Pachomius died in 346, Theodore died in
   364. Against this result we have (1) the fact that in that year April
   27 was twenty-three days after Easter; but the Easter gathering of the
   monks would last over April 11 (Low Sunday), and the death of Theodore
   would come suddenly enough a fortnight later; (2) the fragment (supr.
   p. 551) probably belonging to Letter 39, which a coptic life of
   Theodore makes him state that he received before his last Easter. But
   this cannot be correct; for all known data forbid us to place the death
   of Theodore as late as 367. (Tillemont's tentative opinion, vii. 691,
   761, is bound up with an obsolete chronology of the exiles of Athan.)
   On the other hand Theodore cannot have died as early as 363. Athanasius
   was with him (supr. p. 487) in the summer of that year, and when our
   present letter was written Ath. had clearly kept Easter at home, which
   suits 364, but excludes 363.

   Letter LIX.--To Epictetus.

   To my Lord, beloved brother, and most-longed-for fellow-minister
   Epictetus [4700] , Athanasius greeting in the Lord. I thought that all
   vain talk of all heretics, many as they may be, had been stopped by the
   Synod which was held at NicÃ¦a. For the Faith there confessed by the
   Fathers according to the divine Scriptures is enough by itself at once
   to overthrow all impiety, and to establish the religious belief in
   Christ. For this reason at the present time, at the assembling of
   diverse synods, both in Gaul and Spain, and great Rome [4701] , all who
   came together, as though moved by one spirit, unanimously anathematised
   those who still were secretly holding with Arius, namely Auxentius of
   Milan, Ursacius, Valens, and Gaius of Pannonia. And they wrote
   everywhere, that, whereas the above-said were devising the names of
   synods to cite on their side, no synod should be cited in the Catholic
   Church save only that which was held at NicÃ¦a, which was a monument of
   victory over all heresy, but especially the Arian, which was the main
   reason of the synod assembling when it did. How then, after all this,
   are some attempting to raise doubts or questions? If they belong to the
   Arians, this is not to be wondered at, that they find fault with what
   was drawn up against themselves, just as the Gentiles when they hear
   that the idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's
   hands [4702] ,' think the doctrine of the divine Cross folly. But if
   those who desire to reopen everything by raising questions belong to
   those who think they believe aright, and love what the fathers have
   declared, they are simply doing what the prophet describes, giving
   their neighbour turbid confusion to drink [4703] , and fighting about
   words to no good purpose, save to the subversion of the simple.

   2. I write this after reading the memoranda submitted by your piety,
   which I could wish had not been written at all, so that not even any
   record of these things should go down to posterity. For who ever yet
   heard the like? Who ever taught or learned it? For from Sion shall come
   forth the law of God, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem [4704] ;'
   but whence came forth this? What lower region has vomited the statement
   that the Body born of Mary is coessential with the Godhead of the Word?
   or that the Word has been changed into flesh, bones, hair, and the
   whole body, and altered from its own nature? Or who ever heard in a
   Church, or even from Christians, that the Lord wore a body putatively,
   not in nature; or who ever went so far in impiety as to say and hold,
   that this Godhead, which is coessential with the Father, was
   circumcised and became imperfect instead of perfect; and that what hung
   upon the tree was not the body, but the very creative Essence and
   Wisdom? Or who that hears that the Word transformed for Himself a
   passible body, not of Mary, but of His own Essence, could call him who
   said this a Christian? Or who devised this abominable impiety, for it
   to enter even his imagination, and for him to say that to pronounce the
   Lord's Body to be of Mary is to hold a Tetrad instead of a Triad in the
   Godhead? Those who think thus, saying that the Body of the Saviour
   which He put on from Mary, is of the Essence of the Triad. Or whence
   again have certain vomited an impiety as great as those already
   mentioned; saying namely, that the body is not newer than the Godhead
   of the Word, but was coeternal with it always, since it was compounded
   of the Essence of Wisdom. Or how did men called Christians venture even
   to doubt whether the Lord, Who proceeded from Mary, while Son of God by
   Essence and Nature, is of the seed of David according to the flesh
   [4705] , and of the flesh of the Holy Mary? Or who have been so
   venturesome as to say that Christ Who suffered in the flesh and was
   crucified is not Lord, Saviour, God, and Son of the Father [4706] ? Or
   how can they wish to be called Christians who say that the Word has
   descended upon a holy man as upon one of the prophets, and has not
   Himself become man, taking the body from Mary; but that Christ is one
   person, while the Word of God, Who before Mary and before the ages was
   Son of the Father, is another? Or how can they be Christians who say
   that the Son is one, and the Word of God another?

   3. Such were the contents of the memoranda; diverse statements, but one
   in their sense and in their meaning; tending to impiety. It was for
   these things that men who make their boast in the confession of the
   fathers drawn up at NicÃ¦a were disputing and quarrelling with one
   another. But I marvel that your piety suffered it, and that you did not
   stop those who said such things, and propound to them the right faith,
   so that upon hearing it they might hold their peace, or if they opposed
   it might be counted as heretics. For the statements are not fit for
   Christians to make or to hear, on the contrary they are in every way
   alien from the Apostolic teaching. For this reason, as I said above, I
   have caused what they say to be baldly inserted in my letter, so that
   one who merely hears may perceive the shame and impiety therein
   contained. And although it would be right to denounce and expose in
   full the folly of those who have had such ideas, yet it would be a good
   thing to close my letter here and write no more. For what is so
   manifestly shewn to be evil, it is not necessary to waste time in
   exposing further, lest contentious persons think the matter doubtful.
   It is enough merely to answer such things as follows: we are content
   with the fact that this is not the teaching of the Catholic Church, nor
   did the fathers hold this. But lest the inventors of evil things [4707]
   ' make entire silence on our part a pretext for shamelessness, it will
   be well to mention a few points from Holy Scripture, in case they may
   even thus be put to shame, and cease from these foul devices.

   4. Whence did it occur to you, sirs, to say that the Body is of one
   Essence with the Godhead of the Word? For it is well to begin at this
   point, in order that by shewing this opinion to be unsound, all the
   others too may be proved to be the same. Now from the divine Scriptures
   we discover nothing of the kind. For they say that God came in a human
   body. But the fathers who also assembled at NicÃ¦a say that, not the
   body, but the Son Himself is coessential with the Father, and that
   while He is of the Essence of the Father, the body, as they admitted
   according to the Scriptures, is of Mary. Either then deny the Synod of
   NicÃ¦a, and as heretics bring in your doctrine from the side; or, if you
   wish to be children of the fathers, do not hold the contrary of what
   they wrote. For here again you may see how monstrous it is: If the Word
   is coessential with the body which is of earthly nature, while the Word
   is, by your own confession, coessential with the Father, it will follow
   that even the Father Himself is coessential with the body produced from
   the earth. And why any longer blame the Arians for calling the Son a
   creature, when you go off to another form of impiety, saying that the
   Word was changed into flesh and bones and hair and muscles and all the
   body, and was altered from its own nature? For it is time for you to
   say openly that He was born of earth; for from earth is the nature of
   the bones and of all the body. What then is this great folly of yours,
   that you fight even with one another? For in saying that the Word is
   coessential with the Body, you distinguish the one from the other
   [4708] , while in saying that He has been changed into flesh, you
   imagine a change of the Word Himself. And who will tolerate you any
   longer if you so much as utter these opinions? For you have gone
   further in impiety than any heresy. For if the Word is coessential with
   the Body, the commemoration and the work of Mary are superfluous [4709]
   , inasmuch as the body could have existed before Mary, just as the Word
   also is eternal: if, that is, it is as you say co-essential with the
   Body. Or what need was there even of the Word coming among us, to put
   on what was coessential with Himself, or to change His own nature and
   become a body? For the Deity does not take hold [4710] of itself, so as
   to put on what is of its own Essence, any more than the Word sinned, in
   that it ransoms the sins of others, in order that changing into a body
   it should offer itself a sacrifice for itself, and ransom itself.

   5. But this is not so, far be the thought. For he takes hold of the
   seed of Abraham [4711] ,' as the apostle said; whence it behoved Him to
   be made like His brethren in all things, and to take a Body like us.
   This is why Mary is truly presupposed, in order that He may take it
   from her, and offer it for us as His own. And this Isaiah pointed to in
   his prophecy, in the words: Behold the Virgin [4712] ,' while Gabriel
   is sent to her--not simply to a virgin, but to a virgin betrothed to a
   man [4713] ,' in order that by means of the betrothed man he might shew
   that Mary was really a human being. And for this reason Scripture also
   mentions her bringing forth, and tells of her wrapping Him in swaddling
   clothes; and therefore, too, the paps which He sucked were called
   blessed [4714] . And He was offered as a sacrifice, in that He Who was
   born had opened the womb [4715] . Now all these things are proofs that
   the Virgin brought forth. And Gabriel preached the Gospel to her
   without uncertainty, saying not merely what is born in thee,' lest the
   body should be thought to be extraneously induced upon her, but of
   thee,' that what was born might be believed to be naturally from her,
   inasmuch as Nature clearly shews that it is impossible for a virgin to
   produce milk unless she has brought forth, and impossible for a body to
   be nourished with milk and wrapped in swaddling clothes unless it has
   previously been naturally brought forth. This is the meaning of His
   being circumcised on the eighth day: of Symeon taking Him in his arms,
   of His becoming a young child, and growing when He was twelve years
   old, and of His coming to His thirtieth year. For it was not, as some
   suppose, the very Essence of the Word that was changed, and was
   circumcised, because it is incapable of alteration or change. For the
   Saviour Himself says, Behold, behold, it is I, and I change not [4716]
   ,' while Paul writes: Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and to-day, and
   for ever [4717] .' But in the Body which was circumcised, and carried,
   and ate and drank, and was weary, and was nailed on the tree and
   suffered, there was the impassible and incorporeal Word of God. This
   Body it was that was laid in a grave, when the Word had left it, yet
   was not parted from it, to preach, as Peter says, also to the spirits
   in prison [4718] .

   6. And this above all shews the foolishness of those who say that the
   Word was changed into bones and flesh. For if this had been so, there
   were no need of a tomb. For the Body would have gone by itself to
   preach to the spirits in Hades. But as it was, He Himself went to
   preach, while the Body Joseph wrapped in a linen cloth, and laid it
   away at Golgotha [4719] . And so it is shewn to all that the Body was
   not the Word, but Body of the Word. And it was this that Thomas handled
   when it had risen from the dead, and saw in it the print of the nails,
   which the Word Himself had undergone, seeing them fixed in His own
   Body, and though able to prevent it, did not do so. On the contrary,
   the incorporeal Word made His own the properties of the Body, as being
   His own Body. Why, when the Body was struck by the attendant, as
   suffering Himself He asked, Why smitest thou Me [4720] ?' And being by
   nature intangible, the Word yet said, I gave My back to the stripes,
   and My cheeks to blows, and hid not My face from shame and spitting
   [4721] .' For what the human Body of the Word suffered, this the Word,
   dwelling in the body, ascribed to Himself, in order that we might be
   enabled to be partakers of the Godhead of the Word [4722] . And verily
   it is strange that He it was Who suffered and yet suffered not.
   Suffered, because His own Body suffered, and He was in it, which thus
   suffered; suffered not, because the Word, being by Nature God, is
   impassible. And while He, the incorporeal, was in the passible Body,
   the Body had in it the impassible Word, which was destroying the
   infirmities inherent in the Body. But this He did, and so it was, in
   order that Himself taking what was ours and offering it as a sacrifice,
   He might do away with it, and conversely might invest us with what was
   His, and cause the Apostle to say: This corruptible must put on
   incorruption, and this mortal put on immortality [4723] .'

   7. Now this did not come to pass putatively, as some have supposed: far
   be the thought: but the Saviour having in very truth become Man, the
   salvation of the whole man was brought about. For if the Word were in
   the Body putatively, as they say, and by putative is meant imaginary,
   it follows that both the salvation and the resurrection of man is
   apparent only, as the most impious ManichÃ¦us held. But truly our
   salvation is not merely apparent, nor does it extend to the body only,
   but the whole man, body and soul alike, has truly obtained salvation in
   the Word Himself. That then which was born of Mary was according to the
   divine Scriptures human by nature, and the Body of the Lord was a true
   one; but it was this, because it was the same as our body, for Mary was
   our sister inasmuch as we all are from Adam. And no one can doubt of
   this when he remembers what Luke wrote. For after He had risen from the
   dead, when some thought that they did not see the Lord in the body
   derived from Mary, but were beholding a spirit instead, He said, See My
   hands and My feet, and the prints of the nails, that it is I Myself:
   handle Me and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see Me
   to have. And when He had said thus, He shewed them His hands and His
   feet [4724] .' Whence they can be refuted who have ventured to say that
   the Lord was transformed into flesh and bones. For He did not say, As
   ye see Me to be flesh and bone,' but as ye see Me to have,' in order
   that it might not be thought that the Word Himself was changed into
   these things, but that He might be believed to have them after His
   resurrection as well as before His death.

   8. These things being thus demonstrated, it is superfluous to touch
   upon the other points, or to enter upon any discussion relating to
   them, since the body in which the Word was is not coessential with the
   Godhead, but was truly born of Mary, while the Word Himself was not
   changed into bones and flesh, but came in the flesh. For what John
   said, The Word was made flesh [4725] ,' has this meaning, as we may see
   by a similar passage; for it is written in Paul: Christ has become a
   curse for us [4726] .' And just as He has not Himself become a curse,
   but is said to have done so because He took upon Him the curse on our
   behalf, so also He has become flesh not by being changed into flesh,
   but because He assumed on our behalf living flesh, and has become Man.
   For to say the Word became flesh,' is equivalent to saying the Word has
   become man;' according to what is said in Joel: I will pour forth of My
   Spirit upon all flesh [4727] ;' for the promise did not extend to the
   irrational animals, but is for men, on whose account the Lord is become
   Man. As then this is the sense of the above text, they all will
   reasonably condemn themselves who have thought that the flesh derived
   from Mary existed before her, and that the Word, prior to her, had a
   human soul, and existed in it always even before His coming. And they
   too will cease who have said that the Flesh was not accessible to
   death, but belonged to the immortal Nature. For if it did not die, how
   could Paul deliver to the Corinthians that Christ died for our sins,
   according to the Scriptures [4728] ,' or how did He rise at all if He
   did not also die? Again, they will blush deeply who have even
   entertained the possibility of a Tetrad instead of a Triad resulting,
   if it were said that the Body was derived from Mary. For if (they
   argue) we say the Body is of one Essence with the Word, the Triad
   remains a Triad; for then the Word imports no foreign element into it;
   but if we admit that the Body derived from Mary is human, it follows,
   since the Body is foreign in Essence, and the Word is in it, that the
   addition of the Body causes a Tetrad instead of a Triad.

   9. When they argue thus, they fail to perceive the contradiction in
   which they involve themselves. For even though they say that the Body
   is not from Mary, but is coessential with the Word, yet none the less
   (the very point they dissemble, to avoid being credited with their real
   opinion) this on their own premises can be proved to involve a Tetrad.
   For as the Son, according to the Fathers, is coessential with the
   Father, but is not the Father Himself, but is called coessential, as
   Son with Father, so the Body, which they call coessential with the
   Word, is not the Word Himself, but a distinct entity. But if so, on
   their own shewing, their Triad will be a Tetrad [4729] . For the true,
   really perfect and indivisible Triad is not accessible to addition as
   is the Triad imagined by these persons. And how do these remain
   Christians who imagine another God in addition to the true one? For,
   once again, in their other fallacy one can see how great is their
   folly. For if they think because it is contained and stated in the
   Scriptures, that the Body of the Saviour is human and derived from
   Mary, that a Tetrad is substituted for a Triad, as though the Body
   created an addition, they go very far wrong, so much so as to make the
   creature equal to the Creator, and suppose that the Godhead can receive
   an addition. And they have failed to perceive that the Word is become
   Flesh, not by reason of an addition to the Godhead, but in order that
   the flesh may rise again. Nor did the Word proceed from Mary that He
   might be bettered, but that He might ransom the human race. How then
   can they think that the Body, ransomed and quickened by the Word, made
   an addition in respect of Godhead to the Word that had quickened it?
   For on the contrary, a great addition has accrued to the human Body
   itself from the fellowship and union of the Word with it. For instead
   of mortal it is become immortal; and, though an animal [4730] body, it
   is become spiritual, and though made from earth it entered the heavenly
   gates. The Triad, then, although the Word took a body from Mary, is a
   Triad, being inaccessible to addition or diminution; but it is always
   perfect, and in the Triad one Godhead is recognised, and so in the
   Church one God is preached, the Father of the Word.

   10. For this reason they also will henceforth keep silence, who once
   said that He who proceeded from Mary is not very Christ, or Lord, or
   God. For if He were not God in the Body, how came He, upon proceeding
   from Mary, straightway to be called Emmanuel, which is being
   interpreted God with us [4731] ?' Why again, if the Word was not in the
   flesh, did Paul write to the Romans of whom is Christ after the flesh,
   Who is above all God blessed for ever. Amen [4732] ?' Let them
   therefore confess, even they who previously denied that the Crucified
   was God, that they have erred; for the divine Scriptures bid them, and
   especially Thomas, who, after seeing upon Him the print of the nails,
   cried out My Lord and my God [4733] !' For the Son, being God, and Lord
   of glory [4734] , was in the Body which was ingloriously nailed and
   dishonoured; but the Body, while it suffered, being pierced on the
   tree, and water and blood flowed from its side, yet because it was a
   temple of the Word was filled full of the Godhead. For this reason it
   was that the sun, seeing its creator suffering in His outraged body,
   withdrew its rays and darkened the earth. But the body itself being of
   mortal nature, beyond its own nature rose again by reason of the Word
   which was in it; and it has ceased from natural corruption, and, having
   put on the Word which is above man, has become incorruptible.

   11. But with regard to the imagination of some, who say that the Word
   came upon one particular man, the Son of Mary, just as it came upon
   each of the Prophets, it is superfluous to discuss it, since their
   madness carries its own condemnation manifestly with it. For if He came
   thus, why was that man born of a virgin, and not like others of a man
   and woman? For in this way each of the saints also was begotten. Or
   why, if the Word came thus, is not the death of each one said to have
   taken place on our behalf, but only this man's death? Or why, if the
   Word sojourned among us in the case of each one of the prophets, is it
   said only in the case of Him born of Mary that He sojourned here once
   at the consummation of the ages [4735] ?' Or why, if He came as He had
   come in the saints of former times, did the Son of Mary alone, while
   all the rest had died without rising as yet, rise again on the third
   day? Or why, if the Word had come in like manner as He had done in the
   other cases, is the Son of Mary alone called Emmanuel, as though a Body
   filled full of the Godhead were born of her? For Emmanuel is
   interpreted God with us.' Or why, if He came thus, is it not said that
   when each of the saints ate, drank, laboured, and died, that He (the
   Word) ate, drank, laboured, and died, but only in the case of the Son
   of Mary. For what that Body suffered is said to have been suffered by
   the Word. And while we are merely told of the others that they were
   born, and begotten, it is said in the case of the Son of Mary alone
   that The Word was made Flesh.'

   12. This proves that while to all the others the Word came, in order
   that they might prophesy, from Mary the Word Himself took flesh, and
   proceeded forth as man; being by nature and essence the Word of God,
   but after the flesh man of the seed of David, and made of the flesh of
   Mary, as Paul said [4736] . Him the Father pointed out both in Jordan
   and on the Mount, saying, This is My beloved Son in whom I am well
   pleased [4737] .' Him the Arians denied, but we recognising worship,
   not dividing the Son and the Word, but knowing that the Son is the Word
   Himself, by Whom all things are made, and by Whom we were redeemed. And
   for this reason we wonder how any contention at all has arisen among
   you about things so clear. But thanks to the Lord, much as we were
   grieved at reading your memoranda, we were equally glad at their
   conclusion. For they departed with concord, and peacefully agreed in
   the confession of the pious and orthodox faith. This fact has induced
   me, after much previous consideration, to write these few words; for I
   am anxious lest by my silence this matter should cause pain rather than
   joy to those whose concord occasions joy to ourselves. I therefore ask
   your piety in the first place, and secondly those who hear, to take my
   letter in good part, and if anything is lacking in it in respect of
   piety, to set that right, and inform me. But if it is written, as from
   one unpractised in speech, below the subject and imperfectly, let all
   allow for my feebleness in speaking. Greet all the brethren with you.
   All those with us greet you; may you live in good health in the Lord,
   beloved and truly longed for.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [4700] Of Epictetus, bishop of Corinth, nothing else is known. This
   letter reflects the uncertainty, which attended the victory of the
   Nicene Creed, as to the relation of the Historical Christ to the
   Eternal Son. The questions raised at Corinth were those which troubled
   the Eastern Church generally, and which came to a head in the system of
   Apollinarius, whose distinctive tenet, however, is not mentioned in
   this letter. Persons anxious to place the Nicene doctrine in
   intelligible connection with the matter of the Gospel Narrative had
   debated the question before Epictetus, and with deference to his
   ruling. Their tentative solutions (Â§2 infr.) fall into two classes,
   both of which, in attempting to solve the problem, proceed upon the
   assumption incidentally combated by Athan., that the Manhood of Christ
   was a Hypostasis or Person, which if invested with Divine attributes,
   would introduce a fourth hypostatic entity into the Trinity. To avoid
   this, one class identified the Logos and the Anthropos, either by
   assuming that the Logos was changed into flesh, or that the flesh was
   itself non-natural and of the Divine Essence. The other class excluded
   the Man Jesus from the Trinity, explaining His relation to God on the
   lines of Photinus or the later Nestorians. Both alternatives are
   already glanced at (supr. p. 485) by the Council of 362. In the present
   case, both classes of suggestions seem to have been made tentatively
   and bona fide (Â§12). The letter must have been written before the two
   books against Apollinarianism, which (if genuine) fall about 372. Its
   more exact date depends on the identification of the Councils referred
   to in Â§1 (nun genomenon), and is therefore very doubtful. At any rate
   Apollinarianism proper is not alluded to, and Apollinarius is said to
   have expressed to Serapion of Thmuis his high opinion of our Letter
   (see Letter 54, note 1). It was much quoted in the Christological
   controversies of the next 80 years, e.g. by the Councils of Ephesus and

   Letter LX.--To Adelphius [4738] , Bishop and Confessor: against the
   Arians.

   We have read what your piety has written to us, and genuinely approve
   your piety toward Christ. And above all we glorify God, Who has given
   you such grace as not only to have right opinions, but also, so far as
   that is possible, not to be ignorant of the devices [4739] of the
   devil. But we marvel at the perversity of the heretics, seeing that
   they have fallen into such a pit of impiety that they no longer retain
   even their senses, but have their understanding corrupted on all sides.
   But this attempt is a plot of the devil, and an imitation of the
   disobedient Jews. For as the latter, when refuted on all sides, kept
   devising excuses to their own hurt, if only they could deny the Lord
   and bring upon themselves what was prophesied against them, in like
   manner these men, seeing themselves proscribed on all hands, and
   perceiving that their heresy has become abominable to all, prove
   themselves inventors of evil things [4740] ,' in order that, not
   ceasing their fightings against the truth, they may remain consistent
   and genuine adversaries of Christ. For whence has this new mischief of
   theirs sprung forth? How have they even ventured to utter this new
   blasphemy against the Saviour? But the impious man, it seems, is a
   worthless object, and truly reprobate concerning the Faith [4741] .'
   For formerly, while denying the Godhead of the only-begotten Son of
   God, they pretended at any rate to acknowledge His coming in the Flesh.
   But now, gradually going from bad to worse, they have fallen from this
   opinion of theirs, and become Godless on all hands, so as neither to
   acknowledge Him as God, nor to believe that He has become man. For if
   they believed this they would not have uttered such things as your
   piety has reported against them.

   2. You, however, beloved and most truly longed-for, have done what
   befitted the tradition of the Church and your piety toward the Lord, in
   refuting, admonishing, and rebuking such men. But since, instigated by
   their father the devil, they knew not nor understood,' as it is
   written, but go on still in darkness [4742] ,' let them learn from your
   piety that this error of theirs belongs to Valentinus and Marcion, and
   to ManichÃ¦us, of whom some substituted [the idea of] Appearance for
   Reality, while the others, dividing what is indivisible, denied the
   truth that the Word was made Flesh, and dwelt among us [4743] .' Why
   then, as they hold with those people, do they not also take up the
   heritage of their names? For it is reasonable, as they hold their
   error, to have their names as well, and for the future to be called
   Valentinians, Marcionists, and ManichÃ¦ans. Perhaps even thus, being put
   to shame by the ill savour of the names, they may be enabled to
   perceive into what a depth of impiety they have fallen. And it would be
   within our rights not to answer them at all, according to the apostolic
   advice [4744] : A man that is heretical, after a first and second
   admonition refuse, knowing that such an one is perverted, and sinneth,
   being self-condemned;' the more so, in that the Prophet says about such
   men: The fool shall utter foolishness, and his heart shall imagine vain
   things [4745] .' But since, like their leader, they too go about like
   lions seeking whom among the simple they shall devour [4746] , we are
   compelled to write in reply to your piety, that the brethren being once
   again instructed by your admonition may still further reprobate the
   vain teaching of those men.

   3. We do not worship a creature. Far be the thought. For such an error
   belongs to heathens and Arians. But we worship the Lord of Creation,
   Incarnate, the Word of God. For if the flesh also is in itself a part
   of the created world, yet it has become God's body. And we neither
   divide the body, being such, from the Word, and worship it by itself
   [4747] , nor when we wish to worship the Word do we set Him far apart
   from the Flesh, but knowing, as we said above, that the Word was made
   flesh,' we recognise Him as God also, after having come in the flesh.
   Who, accordingly, is so senseless as to say to the Lord: Leave the Body
   that I may worship Thee;' or so impious as to join the senseless Jews
   in saying, on account of the Body, Why dost Thou, being a man, make
   Thyself God [4748] ?' But the leper was not one of this sort, for he
   worshipped God in the Body, and recognised that He was God, saying,
   Lord, if Thou wilt Thou canst make me clean [4749] .' Neither by reason
   of the Flesh did he think the Word of God a creature: nor because the
   Word was the maker of all creation did he despise the Flesh which He
   had put on. But he worshipped the Creator of the universe as dwelling
   in a created temple, and was cleansed. So also the woman with an issue
   of blood, who believed, and only touched the hem of His garment, was
   healed [4750] , and the sea with its foaming waves heard the incarnate
   Word, and ceased its storm [4751] , while the man blind from birth was
   healed by the fleshly spitting of the Word [4752] . And, what is
   greater and more startling (for perhaps this even offended those most
   impious men), even when the Lord was hanging upon the actual cross (for
   it was His Body and the Word was in it), the sun was darkened and the
   earth shook, the rocks were rent, and the vail of the temple rent, and
   many bodies of the saints which slept arose.

   4. These things then happened, and no one doubted, as the Arians now
   venture to doubt, whether one is to believe the incarnate Word; but
   even from beholding the man, they recognised that He was their maker,
   and when they heard a human voice, they did not, because it was human,
   say that the Word was a creature. On the contrary, they trembled, and
   recognised nothing less than that it was being uttered from a holy
   Temple. How then can the impious fail to fear lest as they refused to
   have God in their knowledge, they may be given up to a reprobate mind,
   to do those things which are not fitting [4753] ?' For Creation does
   not worship a creature. Nor again did she on account of His Flesh
   refuse to worship her Lord. But she beheld her maker in the Body, and
   in the Name of Jesus every knee' bowed, yea and shall bow, of things in
   heaven and things on earth and things under the earth, and every tongue
   shall confess,' whether the Arians approve or no, that Jesus is Lord,
   to the Glory of God the Father [4754] .' For the Flesh did not diminish
   the glory of the Word; far be the thought: on the contrary, it was
   glorified by Him. Nor, because the Son that was in the form of God took
   upon Him the form of a servant [4755] was He deprived of His Godhead.
   On the contrary, He is thus become the Deliverer of all flesh and of
   all creation. And if God sent His Son brought forth from a woman, the
   fact causes us no shame but contrariwise glory and great grace. For He
   has become Man, that He might deify us in Himself, and He has been born
   of a woman, and begotten of a Virgin, in order to transfer to Himself
   our erring generation [4756] , and that we may become henceforth a holy
   race, and partakers of the Divine Nature,' as blessed Peter wrote
   [4757] . And what the law could not do in that it was weak through the
   flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for
   sin, condemned sin in the flesh [4758] .'

   5. Seeing then that Flesh was taken by the Word to deliver all men,
   raise all from the dead, and make redemption for sins, must not they
   appear ungrateful, and be worthy of all hatred, who make light of the
   Flesh, as well as those who on account of it charge the Son of God with
   being a thing created or made? For they as good as cry to God and say:
   Send not Thine Only-begotten Son in the Flesh, cause Him not to take
   flesh of a virgin, lest He redeem us from death and sin. We do not wish
   Him to come in the body, lest He should undergo death on our behalf: we
   do not desire the Word to be made flesh, lest in it He should become
   our Mediator to gain access to thee, and we so inhabit the heavenly
   mansions. Let the gates of the heavens be shut lest Thy Word consecrate
   for us the road thither through the veil, namely His Flesh [4759] .'
   These are their utterances, vented with diabolical daring, by the error
   they have devised. For they who do not wish to worship the Word made
   flesh, are ungrateful for His becoming man. And they who divide the
   Word from the Flesh do not hold that one redemption from sin has taken
   place, or one destruction of death. But where at all will these impious
   men find the Flesh which the Saviour took, apart from Him, that they
   should even venture to say we do not worship the Lord with the Flesh,
   but we separate the Body, and worship Him alone.' Why, the blessed
   Stephen saw in the heavens the Lord standing on [God's] right hand
   [4760] , while the Angels said to the disciples, He shall so come in
   like manner as ye beheld Him going into heaven [4761] :' and the Lord
   Himself says, addressing the Father, I will that where I am, they also
   may be with Me [4762] .' And surely if the Flesh is inseparable from
   the Word, does it not follow that these men must either lay aside their
   error, and for the future worship the Father in the name of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, or, if they do not worship or serve the Word Who came in
   the Flesh, be cast out on all sides, and count no longer as Christians
   but either as heathens, or among the Jews.

   6. Such then, as we have above described, is the madness and daring of
   those men. But our faith is right, and starts from the teaching of the
   Apostles and tradition of the fathers, being confirmed both by the New
   Testament and the Old. For the Prophets say: Send out Thy Word and Thy
   Truth [4763] ,' and Behold the Virgin shall conceive and bear a son,
   and they shall call His name Emmanuel, which is being interpreted God
   with us [4764] .' But what does that mean, if not that God has come in
   the Flesh? While the Apostolic tradition teaches in the words of
   blessed Peter, Forasmuch then as Christ suffered for us in the Flesh;'
   and in what Paul writes, Looking for the blessed hope and appearing of
   our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ, Who gave Himself for us that He
   might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a people for
   His own possession, and zealous of good works [4765] .' How then has He
   given Himself, if He had not worn flesh? For flesh He offered, and gave
   Himself for us, in order that undergoing death in it, He might bring to
   nought him that had the power of death, that is, the devil [4766] .'
   Hence also we always give thanks in the name of Jesus Christ, and we do
   not set at nought the grace which came to us through Him. For the
   coming of the Saviour in the flesh has been the ransom and salvation of
   all creation. So then, beloved and most longed-for, let what I have
   said put in mind those who love the Lord, while as to those who have
   imitated the behaviour of Judas, and deserted the Lord to join
   Caiaphas, let them by these things be taught better, if maybe they are
   willing, if maybe they are ashamed. And let them know that in
   worshipping the Lord in the flesh we do not worship a creature, but, as
   we said above, the Creator Who has put on the created body.

   7. But we should like your piety to ask them this. When Israel was
   ordered to go up to Jerusalem to worship at the temple of the Lord,
   where was the ark, and above it the Cherubim of glory overshadowing the
   Mercy-seat [4767] ,' did they do well or the opposite? If they did ill,
   how came it that they who despised this law were liable to punishment?
   for it is written that if a man make light of it and go not up, he
   shall perish from among the people [4768] . But if they did well, and
   in this proved well-pleasing to God, are not the Arians, abominable and
   most shameful of any heresy, many times worthy of destruction, in that
   while they approve the former People for the honour paid by them to the
   Temple, they will not worship the Lord Who is in the flesh as in a
   temple? And yet the former temple was constructed of stones and gold,
   as a shadow. But when the reality came, the type ceased from
   thenceforth, and there did not remain, according to the Lord's
   utterance, one stone upon another that was not broken down [4769] . And
   they did not, when they saw the temple of stones, suppose that the Lord
   who spoke in the temple was a creature; nor did they set the Temple at
   nought and retire far off to worship. But they came to it according to
   the Law, and worshipped the God who uttered His oracles from the
   Temple. Since then this was so, how can it be other than right to
   worship the Body of the Lord, all-holy and all-reverend as it is,
   announced as it was by the archangel Gabriel, formed by the Holy
   Spirit, and made the Vesture of the Word? It was at any rate a bodily
   hand that the Word stretched out to raise her that was sick of a fever
   [4770] : a human voice that He uttered to raise Lazarus from the dead
   [4771] ; and, once again, stretching out His hands upon the Cross, He
   overthrew the prince of the power of the air, that now works [4772] in
   the sons of disobedience, and made the way clear for us into the
   heavens.

   8. Therefore he that dishonours the Temple dishonours the Lord in the
   Temple; and he that separates the Word from the Body sets at nought the
   grace given to us in Him. And let not the most impious Arian madmen
   suppose that, since the Body is created, the Word also is a creature,
   nor let them, because the Word is not a creature, disparage His Body.
   For their error is matter for wonder, in that they at once confuse and
   disturb everything, and devise pretexts only in order to number the
   Creator among the creatures.

   But let them listen. If the Word were a creature, He would not assume
   the created body to quicken it. For what help can creatures derive from
   a creature that itself needs salvation? But since the Word being
   Creator has Himself made the creatures, therefore also at the
   consummation of the ages [4773] He put on the creature, that He as
   creator might once more consecrate it, and be able to recover it. But a
   creature could never be saved by a creature, any more than the
   creatures were created by a creature, if the Word was not creator.
   Accordingly let them not lie against the divine Scriptures nor give
   offence to simple brethren; but if they are willing let them change
   their mind in their turn, and no longer worship the creature instead of
   God, Who made all things. But if they wish to abide by their impieties,
   let them alone take their fill of them, and let them gnash their teeth
   like their father the devil, because the Faith of the Catholic Church
   knows that the Word of God is creator and maker of all things; and we
   know that while in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
   God [4774] ,' now that He has become also man for our salvation we
   worship Him, not as though He had come in the body equalising Himself
   with it, but as Master, assuming the form of the servant, and Maker and
   Creator coming in a creature in order that, in it delivering all
   things, He might bring the world nigh to the Father, and make all
   things to be at peace, things in heaven and things on the earth. For
   thus also we recognise His Godhead, even the Father's, and worship His
   Incarnate Presence, even if the Arian madmen burst themselves in
   sunder.

   Greet all that love the Lord Jesus Christ. We pray that you may be
   well, and remember us to the Lord, beloved and truly most longed-for.
   If need be this is to be read to Hieracas [4775] the presbyter.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [4738] Adelphius is named in the Tome' (above, p. 486), as bishop of
   Onuphis. Previously he had been exiled by the Arians to the Thebaid
   (above, pp. 297, &c.). Hence in the title of this letter he is styled
   Confessor.' The letter (Migne xxvi, 1072) is directed against the Arian
   Christology. Although Ath. treats it (Â§1) as a new blasphemy,' it had
   been held by the Arians from the first; Epiph. Anc. 33, traces it back
   to Lucian; but doubtless it had by this time been brought more to the
   front in their teaching. We know that it occupied a prominent place in
   the Eunomian system. (References in Dorner III. i. 3.) After briefly
   refuting the doctrinal error, Athanasius turns to the Arian charge of
   creature-worship brought against the Nicene doctrine. Not forgetting to
   remind them that their own doctrine was really open to this charge,
   Ath. points out at greater length that the object of Catholic worship
   is not the human nature of Christ as such, but the Word Incarnate; and
   that the human Saviour is worshipped because He is the Word Himself.
   The date proposed by Montfaucon is adopted, though there is nothing to
   fix it absolutely. Its style closely resembles that of the writings of
   the third Exile.' (See also Bright, Later Tr., p. 61.)

   Letter LXI.--Letter to Maximus. (Written about 371 a.d.)

   To our beloved and most truly longed-for son, Maximus [4776] ,
   philosopher, Athanasius greeting in the Lord.

   Having read the letter now come from you, I approve your piety: but,
   marvelling at the rashness of those who understand neither what they
   say nor whereof they confidently affirm [4777] ,' I had really decided
   to say nothing. For to reply upon matters which are so plain and which
   are clearer than light, is simply to give an excuse for shamelessness
   to such lawless men. And this we have learned from the Saviour. For
   when Pilate had washed his hands, and acquiesced in the false
   accusation of the Jews of that day, the Lord answered him no more, but
   rather warned his wife in a dream, so that He that was being judged
   might be believed to be God not in word, but in power. While after
   vouchsafing Caiaphas no reply to his folly, He Himself by his promise
   [4778] brought all over to knowledge. Accordingly for some time I
   delayed, and have reluctantly yielded to your zeal for the truth, in
   view of the argumentativeness of men without shame. And I have dictated
   nothing beyond what your letter contains, in order that the adversary
   may from henceforth be convinced on the points to which he has
   objected, and may keep his tongue from evil and his lips that they
   speak no guile [4779] .' And would that they would no longer join the
   Jews who passed by of old in reproaching Him that hung upon the Tree:
   If thou be the Son of God save Thyself [4780] .' But if even after this
   they will not give in, yet do you remember the apostolic injunction,
   and a man that is heretical after a first and second admonition refuse,
   knowing that such an one is perverted and sinneth being self-condemned
   [4781] .' For if they are Gentiles, or of the Judaisers, who are thus
   daring, let them, as Jews, think the Cross of Christ a stumbling-block,
   or as Gentiles, foolishness [4782] . But if they pretend to be
   Christians let them learn that the crucified Christ is at once Lord of
   Glory, and the Power of God and Wisdom of God [4783] .

   2. But if they are in doubt whether He is God at all, let them
   reverence Thomas, who handled the Crucified and pronounced Him Lord and
   God [4784] . Or let them fear the Lord Himself, who said, after washing
   the feet of the disciples: Ye call Me Lord and Master [4785] , and ye
   say well, for so I am.' But in the same body in which He was when he
   washed their feet, He also carried up our sins to the Tree [4786] . And
   He was witnessed to as Master of Creation, in that the Sun withdrew his
   beams and the earth trembled and the rocks were rent, and the
   executioners recognised that the Crucified was truly Son of God. For
   the Body they beheld was not that of some man, but of God, being in
   which, even when being crucified, He raised the dead. Accordingly it is
   no good venture of theirs to say that the Word of God came into a
   certain holy man; for this was true of each of the prophets and of the
   other saints, and on that assumption He would clearly be born and die
   in the case of each one of them. But this is not so, far be the
   thought. But once for all at the consummation of the ages [4787] , to
   put away sin' the Word was made flesh [4788] ' and proceeded forth from
   Mary the Virgin, Man after our likeness, as also He said to the Jews,
   Wherefore seek ye to kill Me, a man that hath told you the truth [4789]
   ?' And we are deified not by partaking of the body of some man, but by
   receiving the Body of the Word Himself.

   3. And at this also I am much surprised, how they have ventured to
   entertain such an idea as that the Word became man in consequence of
   His Nature. For if this were so, the commemoration of Mary would be
   superfluous. [4790] For neither does Nature know of a Virgin bearing
   apart from a man. Whence by the good pleasure of the Father, being true
   God, and Word and Wisdom of the Father by nature, He became man in the
   body for our salvation, in order that having somewhat to offer [4791]
   for us He might save us all, as many as through fear of death were all
   their life-time subject to bondage. [4792] ' For it was not some man
   that gave Himself up for us; since every man is under sentence of
   death, according to what was said to all in Adam, earth thou art and
   unto earth thou shalt return. [4793] ' Nor yet was it any other of the
   creatures, since every creature is liable to change. But the Word
   Himself offered His own Body on our behalf that our faith and hope
   might not be in man, but that we might have our faith in God the Word
   Himself. Why, even now that He is become man we behold His Glory, glory
   as of one only-begotten of His Father--full of grace and truth. [4794]
   ' For what He endured by means of the Body, He magnified as God. And
   while He hungered in the flesh, as God He fed the hungry. And if anyone
   is offended by reason of the bodily conditions, let him believe by
   reason of what God works. For humanly He enquires where Lazarus is
   laid, but raises him up divinely. Let none then laugh, calling Him a
   child, and citing His age, His growth, His eating, drinking and
   suffering, lest while denying what is proper for the body, he deny
   utterly also His sojourn among us. And just as He has not become Man in
   consequence of His nature, in like manner it was consistent that when
   He had taken a body He should exhibit what was proper to it, lest the
   imaginary theory of ManichÃ¦us should prevail. Again it was consistent
   that when He went about in the body, He should not hide what belonged
   to the Godhead, lest he of Samosata should find an excuse to call Him
   man, as distinct in person from God the Word.

   4. Let then the unbelievers perceive this, and learn that while as a
   Babe He lay in a manger, He subjected the Magi and was worshipped by
   them; and while as a Child He came down to Egypt, He brought to nought
   the hand-made objects of its idolatry [4795] : and crucified in the
   flesh, He raised the dead long since turned to corruption. And it has
   been made plain to all that not for His own sake but for ours He
   underwent all things, that we by His sufferings might put on freedom
   from suffering and incorruption [4796] , and abide unto life eternal.

   5. This then I have concisely dictated, following, as I said above, the
   lines of your own letter, without working out any point any further but
   only mentioning what relates to the Holy Cross, in order that the
   despisers may be taught better upon the points where they were
   offended, and may worship the Crucified. But do you thoroughly persuade
   the unbelievers; perhaps somehow they may come from ignorance to
   knowledge, and believe aright. And even though what your own letter
   contains is sufficient, yet it is as well to have added what I have for
   the sake of reminder in view of contentious persons; not so much in
   order that being refuted in their venturesome statements they may be
   put to shame, as that being reminded they may not forget the truth. For
   let what was confessed by the Fathers at NicÃ¦a prevail. For it is
   correct, and enough to overthrow every heresy however impious, and
   especially that of the Arians which speaks against the Word of God, and
   as a logical consequence profanes His Holy Spirit. Greet all who hold
   aright. All that are with us greet you.

   [4776] Maximus, probably the Cynic philosopher who plays so strange and
   grotesque a part in the history of S. Gregory Nazianzen's tenure of the
   see of Constantinople (the identification is questioned by Bright, p.
   72, but without very cogent reasons), was the son of Alexandrian
   parents, persons of high social standing, who had suffered much for the
   Faith. He himself was an ardent opponent of Arianism and heathenism,
   and was banished under Valens (further particulars in Dict. Gr. and
   Rom. Biogr. s.v. Maximus Alexandrinus). The present letter compliments
   him on his success in refuting heretics, some of whom advocated the
   Arian Christology; others the doctrine of Paul of Samosata and
   Photinus. The Epistle has much in common with those to Epictetus and
   Adelphius; Montfaucon's date for it is adopted. (See Migne xxvi. 1085;

   Letter LXII.--To John and Antiochus. [4797]

   Athanasius to John and Antiochus, our beloved sons and
   fellow-presbyters in the Lord, greeting.

   I was glad to receive your letter just now, the more so as you wrote
   from Jerusalem. I thank you for informing me about the brethren that
   there assembled, and about those who wish, on account of disputed
   points, to disturb the simple. But about these things let the Apostle
   charge them not to give heed to those who contend about words, and seek
   nothing else than to tell and hear some new thing [4798] . But do you,
   having your foundation sure, even Jesus Christ our Lord, and the
   confession of the fathers concerning the faith, avoid those who wish to
   say anything more or less than that, and rather aim at the profit of
   the brethren, that they may fear God and keep His commandments, in
   order that both by the teaching of the fathers, and by the keeping of
   the commandments, they may be able to appear well-pleasing to the Lord
   in the day of judgment. But I have been utterly astonished at the
   boldness of those who venture to speak against our beloved Basil the
   bishop, a true servant of God. For from such vain talk they can be
   convicted of not loving even the confession of the fathers.

   Greet the brethren. They that are with me greet you. I pray that ye may
   be well in the Lord, beloved and much-desired sons.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [4797] Of John and Antiochus nothing is known, unless the latter is the
   later bishop of Ptolemais and enemy of Chrysostom. Both men seem to
   belong to the class of well-meaning mischief-makers, given to retailing
   invidious stories. Hence the polite reserve of our little note (Migne
   xxvi. 115, and its laconic dismissal of the gossip about Basil, the new
   bishop of the Cappadocian CÃ¦sarea (supr. p. 449). The main interest of
   this and the following letter, which seem to date from the winter
   371-372, consists in the testimony of the high esteem of Athanasius for
   Basil, as well as his indifference to words where no essential
   principle was involved. The two recipients of this letter either lived
   or were visitors at Jerusalem. On Basil's difficulties at this time,
   see D.C.B. i. 288 a, 293, and on his relations with Athan., cf.
   Prolegg. ch. ii. Â§10.

   Letter LXIII.--Letter to the Presbyter Palladius [4799] .

   To our beloved son Palladius, presbyter, Athanasius the Bishop greeting
   in the Lord.

   I was glad to receive also the letter written by you alone, the more so
   that you breathe orthodoxy in it, as is your wont. And having learnt
   not for the first time, but long ago, the reason of your staying at
   present with our beloved Innocent [4800] , I am pleased with your
   piety. Since then you are acting as you are, write and let me know how
   are the brethren there, and what the enemies of the truth think about
   us. But whereas you have also told me of the monks at CÃ¦sarea, and I
   have learned from our beloved Dianius [4801] that they are vexed, and
   are opposing our beloved bishop Basil, I am glad you have informed me,
   and I have pointed out [4802] to them what is fitting, namely that as
   children they should obey their father, and not oppose what he
   approves. For if he were suspected as touching the truth, they would do
   well to combat him. But if they are confident, as we all are, that he
   is a glory to the Church, contending rather on behalf of the truth and
   teaching those who require it, it is not right to combat such an one,
   but rather to accept with thanks his good conscience. For from what the
   beloved Dianius has related, they appear to be vexed without cause. For
   he, as I am confident, to the weak becomes weak to gain the weak [4803]
   . But let our beloved friends look at the scope of his truth, and at
   his special purpose [4804] , and glorify the Lord Who has given such a
   bishop to Cappadocia as any district must pray to have. And do you,
   beloved, be good enough to point out to them the duty of obeying, as I
   write. For this is at once calculated to render them well disposed
   toward their father, and will preserve peace to the churches. I pray
   that you may be well in the Lord, beloved son.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [4799] On the general subject and date of this letter see note 1 to
   Letter 62. Of Palladius, who is clearly a resident at CÃ¦sarea, nothing
   further is known. The tone of this letter is more confiding than that
   of the previous one. (Migne ib. 1167.)

   [4800] Perhaps a bishop in the neighbourhood of CÃ¦sarea. See D.C.B.
   s.v. Innocentius (4).

   [4801] Namesake of a predecessor of Basil, otherwise unknown.

   [4802] The letter here referred to is lost. The monks in question had
   raised a cry against Basil on account of the reserve with which he
   spoke of the Divine Personality of the Holy Spirit. (See supr. p. 481.)

   Letter LXIV.--To Diodorus (fragment).

   To my lord, son, and most beloved fellow-minister Diodorus [bishop of
   Tyre] [4805] , Athanasius greeting in the Lord.

   I thank my Lord, Who is everywhere establishing His doctrine, and
   chiefly so by means of His own sons, such as actual fact shews you to
   be. For before your Reverence wrote, we knew how great grace has been
   brought to pass in Tyre by means of your perseverance. And we rejoice
   with you that by your means Tyre also has learned the right word of
   piety. And I indeed took an opportunity of writing to you, longed-for
   and beloved: but I marvel at your not having replied to my letter. Be
   not then slow to write at once, knowing that you give me refreshment,
   as a son to his father, and make me exceeding glad, as a herald of
   truth. And enter upon no controversy with the heretics, but overcome
   their argumentativeness with silence, their ill-will with courtesy. For
   thus your speech shall be with grace, seasoned with salt [4806] ,'
   while they [will be judged] by the conscience of all....
     __________________________________________________________________

   [4805] This fragment (Migne xxvi. 1261) is given by Facundus, Def. Tr.
   Cap. iv. 2, who claims it as addressed to Diodorus of Tarsus, the
   famous Antiochene confessor and master of Chrysostom and Theodore.
   Unfortunately this is impossible, as Diodore became bishop of Tarsus
   not before 378, i.e. after Athan. was dead. The letter itself decides
   for Diodorus of Tyre, whom Paulinus of Antioch had quite unwarrantably
   ordained to this see (cf. Rufin, H. E. ii. 21). Whether (as has been
   held on the authority of Rufinus) Diodorus, or (as Le Quien, Or. Chr.
   ii. 865 sq. holds) Zeno, the nominee of Meletius, was first in the
   field in the unseemly scramble, is doubtful. Zeno is already bishop in
   365 (Soz. vi. 12); the date of the appointment of Diodorus, whose claim
   is at any rate no better than that of Paulinus himself, is quite
   uncertain (see also Prolegg. ch. ii. Â§Â§9, 10). Diodorus was the friend
   and correspondent of Epiphanius, and of Timothy, bishop of Alexandria,
   second from Athanasius. Facundus confuses him in these particulars also
   with his namesake of Tarsus, but the mistake is thoroughly sifted by
   Tillemont, Mem. viii. pp. 238, 712. The letter is important, along with
   Letter 56, and the correspondence of S. Basil, as illustrating the
   attitude of Athanasius with regard to the unhappy schism of Antioch.

   [4806] Col. iv. 6.

   Memorandum.--On other Letters ascribed to Athanasius.

   The above Collection of Letters is complete upon the principle stated
   in the Introduction (supr., p. 495). But one or two fragments have been
   excluded which may be specified here.

   (1.) Fragment of a letter to Eupsychius;' probably the Nicene Father
   referred to Ep. Ã†g. 8, (cf. D.C.B. ii. 299 (4)). The Greek is given by
   Montf. in Ath. Opp. 1. p. 1293 (Latin, ib. p. 1287). It was cited in
   Conc. Nic. II. Act vi., but although it has affinities with Orat. ii. 8
   (high-priestly dress'), it has the appearance of a polemical argument
   against Monophysitism. (Migne xxvi. 1245.)

   (2.) To Epiphanius' (Migne xxvi. 1257). Against certain, who
   contentiously follow the Jews in celebrating Easter. (From Chron.
   Pasch. pag. 4 postremÃ¦ editionis.')

   (3.) Fragments of an Epistola ad Antiochenos' (not our Tomus,' supr.,
   p. 483): also a polemic against Monophysitism, and almost Nestorian in
   doctrine: Jesus Christus...non est Ipse' [i.e. ante sÃ¦cula et in
   sÃ¦cula, Heb. xiii. 8], and duas personas' asserted of Christ. From
   Facundus, who says the letter was written against the Apollinarians,
   and who gives it on the authority of Peter, Ath.'s successor (Migne
   xxvi. 1259).

   (4.) Ad Eusebium, Lucinianum, et socios.' (In Migne xxvi. 1325 sq.,
   from Mai, Script. Vet. 11. 583 sq.) A minute fragment. Cf. supr.,
   Letter 55, notes 1, 7.

   (5.) Spurious letters (in Migne xxviii.) to Jovian, to Castor (2), to a
   bishop of the Persians,' and to and from popes Liberius, Marcus, Julius
   and Felix (made up out of late and spurious decretals, &c., &c.).
